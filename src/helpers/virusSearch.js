[{"keywords": "", "abstract": "Objectives:\nAnti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#945; agents like Infliximab (IFX) are effective in the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) and are widely used. However, a considerable number of patients do not respond or lose response to this therapy. Preliminary evidence suggests that transmembrane TNF-&#945; (tmTNF-&#945;) might be linked to response to IFX by promoting reverse signaling-induced apoptosis in inflammatory cells. The main aim of this study was the evaluation of this hypothesis in primary IFX non-responders.Methods:\nA total of 47 IFX naive IBD patients were included in the study. Blood samples were taken before the start of IFX therapy (at week 0) and after induction therapy (at week 14). Endoscopic disease activity and markers of inflammation at baseline and at week 14 were used to evaluate response. Baseline soluble TNF-&#945; (sTNF-&#945;), percentage of circulating TNF-&#945; positive cells, mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of tmTNF-&#945;, and apoptosis rate at week 14 in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were evaluated in IFX responders and non-responders.Results:\nMean sTNF-&#945; was not significantly different in responders compared to non-responders (P=0.13). Mean percentage of tmTNF-&#945; bearing lymphocytes and monocytes was higher in the PBMCs of responders (P=0.05 and P=0.014, respectively). Mean MFI of tmTNF-&#945; in circulating lymphocytes and monocytes was greater in responders (P=0.002 and P<0.001, respectively). Moreover, the mean percentage of apoptosis in PBMCs was significantly greater in responders compared to non-responders (P=0.002).Conclusions:\nThe percentage of tmTNF-&#945; bearing lymphocytes and monocytes and the intensity of tmTNF-&#945; in the circulating leukocyte population of IBD patients was directly related to primary response to IFX. This was likely due&#8212;as assessed by the apoptosis rate&#8212;to promotion of inflammatory cell death. Thus, our data suggest that peripheral leukocytes could in principle be used for predicting primary response to IFX in IBD patients.", "body": "Introduction\nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD)&#8212;primarily, Crohn&#8217;s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC)1&#8212;are quickly becoming a global healthcare problem2 as patients are becoming refractory to the most effective medications, the anti-tumor necrosis factor-&#945; (anti-TNF-&#945;) agents.3 Elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines have been demonstrated in serum and intestinal mucosa of IBD patients. Among them, TNF-&#945; appears to be a key player.4 Inhibition of TNF-&#945; by monoclonal antibodies&#8212;such as Infliximab (IFX) and Adalimumab&#8212;has been shown for more than a decade to be the most effective treatment for IBD patients; however, despite their proven efficacy, up to 30% of biological naive patients do not respond to anti-TNF agents after the induction phase&#8212;so-called primary non response (PNR)&#8212;and up to 13% per year of those who initially respond will eventually lose response over time (secondary loss of response (SLR)).3, 5, 6 The mechanisms at the basis of PNR and SLR might be multiple and are still not fully understood. The literature suggests that PNR may be associated with stricturing disease and lack of response to any medical therapy.5, 6 In primary non-responders the disease could also be driven by a biological process (partially) independent of TNF-&#945;. Alternatively, the drug dose might simply not be enough for the patient&#8217;s effective disease burden.7, 8 Finally, the lack of response could be due to other less clear factors (genetics, drug metabolism and disposition).5 Unfortunately, in clinical practice it is often difficult to identify the mechanism at the basis of PNR and SLR, and to accurately predict therapeutic response to anti-TNF agents from the outset. Clearly, the identification of biomarkers capable of predicting such response remains an important goal in clinical IBD research today.Transmembrane TNF-&#945; (tmTNF-&#945;), a precursor of the soluble form of TNF-alpha (sTNF-&#945;), is expressed on activated macrophages and lymphocytes as well as other cell types. After processing by TNF-&#945; converting enzyme, the sTNF-&#945; is cleaved from tmTNF-&#945; and mediates its biological activities through binding to TNF receptors of remote tissues. Accumulating evidence suggests that not only sTNF-&#945; but also tmTNF-&#945; is involved in the inflammatory response. tmTNF-&#945; acts as a bipolar molecule that transmits signals both as a ligand and as a receptor. On TNF-&#945;-producing cells it binds to TNF receptors, and transmits signals to the target cell as a ligand, while also acting as a receptor transmitting outside-to-inside signals back to the cell.9, 10, 11 When playing the receptor role, tmTNF-&#945; also acts as a receptor for IFX. Binding of IFX to tmTNF-&#945; activates several anti-inflammatory mechanisms including 'tmTNF-&#945; reverse signaling-induced apoptosis', which is considered one of the most important.11, 12, 13 In this process, tmTNF-&#945; acts as a cell surface receptor binding the circulating IFX and thereby activating apoptosis of the tmTNF-&#945; bearing inflammatory cells. Apoptosis with depletion of the inflammatory cells will then result in attenuation of inflammation.Thus, the concentration of tmTNF-&#945; and the number of tmTNF-&#945; bearing cells might be related to IFX response in IBD. A greater tmTNF-&#945; density could lead to more effective induction of IFX-induced apoptosis in inflammatory cells, and to a better clinical response to IFX. Were that the case, the density of tmTNF-&#945; and the number of tmTNF-&#945; bearing cells could be leveraged as biomarkers of IFX response. In this study we have tested such hypotheses in patients with PNR to IFX.\nMethods\n\nPatients\nIFX naive IBD patients, who failed corticosteroids and/or immunomodulators, were included in the study. The inclusion criteria were as follows: verifiable diagnosis of CD or UC based on standard endoscopic, radiologic, and histologic criteria;14, 15, 16 age 16 years or older; testing negative for hepatitis B and C; human immunodeficiency virus; latent or current tuberculosis (by chest X-ray and tuberculin skin test); serum cytomegalovirus PCR; and negative stool Clostridium difficile and stool culture. Exclusion criteria were as follows: previous IBD-related intestinal resection, perianal disease, history of severe heart disease, neurodegenerative diseases, pregnancy, and previous history of colon cancer. In addition, patients were excluded in the presence of intestinal strictures, abscess, fistulas, or sepsis&#8212;conditions that might impact on medical response to anti-TNF-&#945; agents or any other medication.5, 6 Hence, all the CD patients had a non-stricturing, non-penetrating phenotype (Montreal B1).17 We also stipulated that patients demonstrating intolerance to IFX had to be excluded from the study.Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects and the protocol was approved by the local Ethical Committee.\nStudy protocol\nThe treatment protocol included a standard IFX dose of 5&#8201;mg/kg at weeks 0, 2, and 6 as induction, and every 8 weeks thereafter as maintenance. The first blood sample was drawn at baseline, before the first IFX infusion. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were extracted and subjected to flow cytometry. The percentage of TNF-&#945;-positive lymphocytes and monocytes, along with the intensity of TNF-&#945; expression in each cell population was also analyzed. Serum samples were analyzed for sTNF-&#945; level.At week 14, a blood sample was collected immediately before the 4th IFX infusion. PBMCs were extracted and subjected to flow cytometric analysis for the evaluation of apoptosis and additional tests (see below).Endoscopic assessment was conducted at weeks 0 and 14 (see next paragraph). Figure 1 shows the flowchart of the study protocol in detail.\nEvaluation of response to IFX\nThe common clinical definition of PNR to IFX is the lack of improvement of clinical signs and symptoms with induction therapy.3, 5 However, in our study we chose more objective and reliable parameters of therapeutic response namely endoscopic disease activity and markers of inflammation before and after treatment. For the purpose, colonoscopy was performed at week 0 (baseline) and 14, immediately before the first maintenance infusion. Endoscopic response in UC was defined as an improvement of the endoscopic Mayo score of at least one point from baseline.18 Endoscopic response in CD was defined as a decrease of &#8805;5 in the CDEIS score.19 In addition, C-reactive protein (CRP), and fecal calprotectin (FC) (FCal ELISA, B&#252;hlmann, Sch&#246;nenbuch, Switzerland) were measured at weeks 0 and 14, using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A CRP level of (up to) 5&#8201;mg/l and FC level of (up to)100&#8201;&#956;g/g were considered normal values.Finally, to gain additional knowledge on the mechanism at the basis of PNR, IFX trough levels (ITL) and antibodies to IFX (ATI) (IDKmonitor-infliximab drug level ELISA and IDKmonitor-infliximab total ADA ELISA, Immundiagnostik AG, Bensheim, Germany) were measured immediately before the 4th IFX infusion at week 14 by ELISA. An ITL of 0.8&#8201;&#956;g/ml and an ATI value of 10&#8201;U/ml were considered as cutoff detection levels. IDKmonitor-infliximab total ADA ELISA detects total ADA (bound and free ADA) and is categorized as a drug-tolerant assay.\nFlow cytometric analysis of PBMCs\nPBMCs were isolated by gradient centrifugation on a layer of Ficoll-Paque Plus (Amersham, Uppsala, Sweden). For the evaluation of tmTNF-&#945; mean fluorescence intensity (MFI), extracted leukocytes were subjected to the acid wash process to remove receptor-bound TNF (cells were reconstituted for 5&#8201;min in RPMI 1640 medium, pH 2.5 containing 10% FBS). Cells were then washed twice with PBS before flow cytometric evaluation. The cells were stained for tmTNF-&#945; by phycoerythrin conjugated anti-TNF-&#945; monoclonal antibody (PE-Mouse Anti-Human TNF, Biolegend, San Diego, CA) in PBS with 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% sodium azide for 30&#8201;min at 4&#8201;&#176;C. Before staining, cells were Fc-blocked by 1&#8201;&#956;g of human IgG for 15&#8201;min at room temperature. Using the gating strategy, based on forward scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC) two separate gates were identified for the lymphocyte and monocytes populations (Supplementary Figure 1S).For the assessment of PBMCs&#8217; apoptotic activity, cells were stained by FITC Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit (BioLegend) with Propidium Iodide. Briefly, the cells were washed twice with cold BioLegend's Cell Staining Buffer, and then were re-suspended in Annexin V Binding Buffer. Subsequently, FITC Annexin V and Propidium Iodide Solution were added. Following 15&#8201;min incubation at room temperature in the dark, annexin V Binding Buffer was added. The cells were then subjected to flow cytometry.Staining with the relevant isotype-matched control monoclonal antibody (BioLegend) was performed in all flow cytometric evaluations.Immediately after staining, flow cytometric analysis was performed on a FACScalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). At least 10&#8201;000 PBMCs per sample were analyzed. The data were analyzed using Flow Jo software (Tree star, Ashland, OR). An example of an individual run of apoptotic rates in responders and non-responders is illustrated in Supplementary Figure 2S.\nsTNF-\u03b1 analysis\nCollected serum samples were stored at &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C until analysis. Serum levels of TNF-&#945; were measured by ELISA, according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer (Human TNF-alpha Quantikine HS ELISA, R&D Systems-Minneapolis, MN). Human TNF-&#945; controls (QuantiGlo Immunoassay Control Set 732 for Human TNF-alpha) were also used to increase the test accuracy.\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS for Windows, version 21 (IBM Armonk, NY). Central tendency and variability for numeric variables were measured using the mean and s.d., respectively. Normality test was performed for dependent variables. For normally distributed variables the parametric independent t-test and the paired t-test were used. For variables which were not normally distributed, the non-parametric Mann&#8211;Whitney U-test and Wilcoxon test were used. The Pearson/Spearman&#8217;s correlation coefficient was used to test potential correlation of variables. The analysis of covariance test was used to analyze mean differences among two groups with treatment as factor and baseline as covariate. The prognostic value of candidate variables was evaluated by plotting receiver operating characteristic curves and calculation of the area under the curve. Maximum point of the Youden's index (Youden's J) was identified as the cutoff value in the separation of responders and non-responders. The Youden's index is the likelihood of a positive test result in subjects with the condition vs. those without the condition. This index combines sensitivity and specificity into a single measure and has a value between 0 and 1. In a perfect test the Youden's value equals 1. A P value &#8804;0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nResults\nTable 1 shows the baseline characteristics of the enrolled patients. In total, 63 IFX naive IBD patients were identified as eligible for the study. Of the 63 eligible patients, 16 patients did not complete the treatment protocol and were later excluded. In total, 47 IFX naive IBD patients were evaluated in this study (Figure 1).The patient population was composed by 22 females and 25 males, with 34 CD and 13 UC patients. The mean age was 36 years, ranging from 17 to 60. The mean duration of disease was 6.6 years, ranging from 3 to 12. Only 8.5% of patients were smokers at time of enrollment and 17% had a family history of IBD. Of the CD patients, equal proportions had ileal, colonic and ilecolonic disease. Of the UC patients 62% had pancolitis and 38% left sided colitis.Based on the endoscopic criteria described in Methods, a total of 30 responders and 17 non-responders were identified in our cohort. The clinical and laboratory characteristics of responders and non-responders are compared in Table 2.Almost 2/3 of UC and CD patients were primary responders. At baseline (week 0, before therapy), the CDEIS and Mayo subscore were similar in the two groups. After induction therapy (week 14), the mean CDEIS score in CD patients decreased by 8.3 points in responders compared to 1.45 points in non-responders (P<0.001). In UC patients, the mean Mayo endoscopic subscore decreased by 1.37 points in responders, while it increased by 0.2 points in non-responders (P<0.001).ITL were 4.1&#177;2.4 in responders compared to 1.1&#177;1.1&#8201;&#956;g/ml (P<0.001) in non-responders. In 57% of responders and 12% of non-responders ITL was within the therapeutic window (3&#8211;7&#8201;&#956;g/ml).20 ATI were present in 35.3% of non-responders and in 10% of responders. Mean CRP and FC were similar at baseline in the two groups. Mean CRP decreased by 17.5% in non-responders and by 86% in responders after induction therapy (P<0.001). Mean FC decreased by 75% in responders after induction therapy, while it increased by 12% in non-responders (P<0.001).Next, sTNFa and tm-TNF-&#945; were measured at baseline, and apoptosis at week 14.Mean sTNF-&#945; was 24.1&#177;41.8&#8201;pg/ml vs. 20.6&#177;31.6&#8201;pg/ml, in responders vs. non-responders, respectively (P=0.13) (Figure 2a).The mean percentage of tmTNF-&#945; bearing lymphocytes was borderline statistically different between responders and non-responders (71.4&#177;13.6 vs. 64.3&#177;12.1, respectively, P=0.05) (Figure 2b).The mean percentage of tmTNF-&#945; bearing monocytes was significantly greater in responders compared to non-responders (66.5&#177;9.6 vs. 59.8&#177;6.5, respectively, P=0.014) (Figure 2b).Mean lymphocyte MFI of tmTNF-&#945; was greater in responders compared to non-responders (34.1&#177;12.1 vs. 18.5&#177;12.6, P=0.002) (Figure 2c). No significant correlation was observed between the lymphocyte MFI and sTNF-&#945; values (r=&#8722;0.043, P=0.77). Mean monocyte MFI of tmTNF-&#945; was also significantly greater in responders compared to non-responders (31.3&#177;10.4 vs. 17.1&#177;9.9, respectively, P<0.001) (Figure 2c). No significant correlation was observed between the monocyte MFI and sTNF-&#945; values (r=&#8722;0.101, P=0.49).The mean percentage of apoptosis in PBMCs was significantly greater in responders compared to non-responders, (4.1&#177;1.3% vs. 2.8&#177;1%, respectively, P=0.002) (Figure 2d). A significant positive correlation was observed between apoptosis and tmTNF-&#945; MFI values of both lymphocytes and monocytes with correlation coefficients of 0.783 and 0.689, respectively (P<0.001). There was no significant correlation between apoptosis and sTNF-&#945; levels (r=&#8722;0.100, P=0.5).Construction of receiver operating characteristic curves and calculation of area under the curve was used to evaluate the prognostic power of MFI in tmTNF-&#945; bearing lymphocytes and monocytes to predict response to IFX.For the lymphocyte MFI, area under the curve was 0.827 (95% confidence interval, 0.695&#8211;0.960; P<0.001) with the optimal cutoff value of 30.5, with a sensitivity and specificity of 83.3 and 88.2, respectively (Figure 3a).For the monocytes MFI, area under the curve was 0.884 (95% confidence interval, 0.787&#8211;0.982; P<0.001) with an optimal cutoff value of 24.5, with sensitivity and specificity of 86.7 and 88.2, respectively (Figure 3b).\nDiscussion\nAnti-TNF agents, including IFX, are widely used in moderate to severe IBD. However, a sizeable proportion of biological naive patients fail to respond (PNR) or lose response over time (SLR). Given the potentially serious adverse effects of IFX and the financial burden it imposes to both health systems and patients, the identification of biomarkers which could help predict response to IFX might reduce the risks and costs for those patients who will fail to respond.21, 22Several potential biomarkers have been proposed to predict PNR to IFX in IBD patients.22 Among them, the role of serum TNF-&#945; level in IFX response has been widely investigated. However, there is no consensus as to its utility.Martinez-Borra et al. reported that a high serum TNF-&#945; level is associated with lack of response to IFX in CD patients.23 By contrast, Magnusson et al. showed that baseline levels of TNF-&#945; tended to be higher in responders than in non-responders.24 Others have shown that baseline serum TNF-&#945; in rheumatoid arthritis patients might provide a good estimation of the global disease burden and&#8212;as such&#8212;should be targeted in IFX dose titration studies.25In addition to the neutralization of sTNF-&#945;, IFX appears to attenuate inflammation by the so-called &#8220;tmTNF-&#945; reverse signaling-induced apoptosis&#8221; whereby tmTNF-&#945; appears to act as a cell surface receptor binding circulating IFX, binding which in turn triggers reverse signaling and other events, including apoptosis of the tmTNF-&#945; bearing cells, a de facto cellular suicide.11, 12, 13 This mechanism of action of IFX seems to be clinically very important. In fact, IBD patients do not respond to Etanercept, (another anti-TNF-&#945; agent) which&#8212;by contrast with IFX&#8212;only appears to inhibit sTNF-&#945;, but does not induce reverse signaling through tmTNF-&#945; binding.4, 13, 26In this regard, Atreya et al. showed that CD patients with a high number of tmTNF-&#945; positive cells (as tested in inflamed intestinal tissue) had a better response to anti-TNF-&#945; therapy when compared to patients with a low number of tmTNF-&#945; positive cells.27In this study, we tested the hypothesis that a high density of TNF-&#945; on the surface of TNF-&#945; bearing circulating cells might lead to more efficient induction of reverse signaling associated apoptosis, and might predict response to IFX in IBD patients. For the purpose, we enrolled CD and UC patients naive to IFX and tested sTNF-&#945;, percentage of circulating TNF-&#945; positive monocytes and lymphocytes, MFI of tmTNF-&#945; in circulating lymphocytes and monocytes, and apoptosis rate in PBMCs of IFX responders and non-responders. It is important to stress that patients were identified as responders or non-responders based on a solid objective clinical outcome&#8212;endoscopic activity&#8212;after full induction therapy. In addition, we measured blood and stool markers of inflammation before and after therapy. We believe that these are more reliable indicators of response than symptomatic improvement after the IFX induction phase.3, 5 Enrolled patients had no strictures or other disease complications which would have made them potentially resistant to any medical therapy. We also measured ITL and ATI&#8212;based on the currently held opinion that resistance to IFX might be due to low ITL or to the presence of ATI, albeit less likely in PNR than in SLR.5, 6A total of 47 patients completed the study. More than 2/3 responded to IFX, showing a significant drop in endoscopic scores, CRP and FC levels. IFX responders had higher ITL when compared to non-responders. In addition, 35% of non-responders (and 10% of responders) had detectable ATI levels. It should be noted that the use of a drug-tolerant assay allowed us to detect ATI in the presence of an adequate IFX concentration.28 These data (as well as the very restrictive inclusion criteria) further suggest overall that in our patient population the lack of response&#8212;when present&#8212;could be driven by factors other than immune response to IFX such as a specific biologic mechanism. Indeed, the MFI value of tmTNF-&#945; was significantly lower in IFX non-responders compared to IFX responders, in both monocytes and lymphocytes. In addition, the apoptosis rate in PBMCs was also lower in IFX non-responders compared to IFX responders. By contrast, sTNF-&#945; did not significantly differ in the two populations and did not correlate with MFI values and apoptotic rates. Taken together these findings might suggest that in non-responders less circulating IFX binds to tmTNF-&#945; which in turn might lead to faster clearance (leading to lower ITL) and decreased efficacy.Other data suggest that PNR might be due to a disease burden exceeding the neutralizing capacity of the standard IFX dose.7, 8, 29 However, our findings are not inconsistent with such conclusion. They rather suggest that in PNR IFX efficacy seems to be hampered by a defective target&#8212;which could in principle be overcome by larger medication doses, a scenario functionally and clinically indistinguishable from a greater disease burden. Clearly, many other mechanisms might also be at play.Similar observations have been made in other diseases. For example, different sensitivity to apoptosis induced by anti-TNF-&#945; therapy has been previously shown in PBMCs of rheumatoid arthritis patients.30Hence, our results show that in principle a simple blood test in PBMCs could be used to predict response to IFX in IBD patients. This conclusion is also supported by the good prognostic value, sensitivity and specificity of tmTNF-&#945; MFI of both lymphocytes and monocytes as assessed by receiver operating characteristic and area under the curve.Potential limitations of our study are the relatively small sample size and the relatively short follow up. In addition, we have only studied patients with PNR to IFX&#8212;and it is not clear whether our findings would also apply to SLR.In conclusion, our data show that the intensity of tmTNF-&#945; on circulating leukocytes in IBD patients is related to IFX response in both CD and UC. This observation has the potential to be used clinically given its relatively low cost and lack of invasiveness. Further studies to confirm these findings are warranted.\nStudy Highlights\n", "pmid": "28914262", "title": "Transmembrane TNF-&#945; Density, but not Soluble TNF-&#945; Level, is Associated with Primary Response to Infliximab in Inflammatory Bowel Disease", "journal_title": "Clinical and Translational Gastroenterology", "authors": "Azade Amini Kadijani;Hamid Asadzadeh Aghdaei;Dario Sorrentino;Alireza Mirzaei;Shabnam Shahrokh;Hedieh Balaii;Vu Q Nguyen;Jessica L Mays;Mohammad Reza Zali", "doi": "10.1038/ctg.2017.44", "score": "0.043743603"}, {"keywords": "", "abstract": " 1. It was found in forty rhesus monkeys that intracerebral, intraocular, intracutaneous, intraperitoneal, intraspinal, and neural inoculations of poliomyelitis virus produced no lesions in the olfactory bulbs despite the fact that the animals contracted pronounced paralyses. This indicated that the virus could be restricted to certain neuronal systems. 2. Similarly intranasal inoculation of seven animals produced no lesions in the ciliary ganglia. 3. Two monkeys convalescent from an intracutaneous and an intracerebral inoculation respectively had further paralyses after intranasal inoculation of heterologous virus. A third animal convalescent from an intranasal inoculation showed extension of lesions after intranasal and intraocular inoculation with heterologous virus. 4. Two spinal animals in which an attack of poliomyelitis was limited to an isolated segment of spinal cord, contracted typical paralyses in the previously uninvaded portions of the CNS following intranasal inoculation of homologous virus. 5. Four of six convalescent monkeys showed extension of lesions but no clinical signs after homologous virus inoculation through a previously un-invaded portal. 6. Four animals convalescent from a unilateral intranasal inoculation showed evidence of new invasion in the opposite olfactory bulb but no extension of paralyses following a second inoculation of homologous virus into the appropriate nostril. 7. Two animals had second attacks after heterologous second inoculations. The intranasal portal was employed for both exposures. 8. It thus seems apparent that in the rhesus monkey a second attack of poliomyelitis, whether paralytic or not, seems to depend upon the strains of virus used and the degree to which virus is disseminated through the neuraxis during the first exposure. 9. The above experimental data emphasize the difficulty of utilizing the rhesus monkey for experiments seeking to elucidate the mechanisms of immunity in man and suggest that human immunity to poliomyelitis does not result from immunization of the nervous system but rather is the result of some process which prevents infective quantities of active virus from reaching nervous tissue.

Among these types of curettes, those of CS stand outin terms of constant usage for maintaining their cutting ability for a longer time than the other types.4,6,7 Tungsten carbide curettes have the disadvantage of being costly and difficult of sharpening, reasons that led these instruments to be no longer marketed.7 Sharp curettes are found to be more efficient than blunt one sin obtaining adequate root surface and lesser formation of smear layer.6 Sterilization of instruments is a routine in the dental offices, and the most widespread means of sterilization are: Oven (dry heat) and autoclave (moist heat). In ovens, temperatures ranging from 160&#176;C to 170&#176;C, for at least 2 and 1 h, respectively, must be set in the oven. In this method, the heat penetrates unevenly in the instrument and requires greater exposure and high temperatures.8 In the autoclave, temperatures ranging between 121&#176;C and 134&#176;C are required for 15-30 min to achieve the sterilization.3,9 This method is faster and more effective but has the disadvantage of causing corrosion mainly in CS instruments.10The method for autoclave sterilization is more sensitive, especially when the drying process is not properly completed and the sealing of the instruments is not done with suitable paper. Sterilization cycles cause undesirable changes in the physical properties of the instruments, such as corrosion, temper shifts and loss of cutting.11,12 These changes cause great inconvenience, either for the time taken for a new sharpening or even for the loss of the instrument.13-15Thus, this study evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the effect of repeated oven and autoclave sterilization cycles on the cutting edge of CS and SS periodontal Gracey curettes after SRP.\nMaterials and Methods\nThis study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of UNITAU under protocol #120-03.

The sterilization methods used were oven and autoclave. Autoclaving was performed at a temperature of 130&#176;C for 15 min, followed by drying at 110&#176;C for 30 min. Sterilization by dry heat was performed at 170&#176;C for 60 min. The oven (Olidef, Ind. e Com. Equip Odontol&#243;gicos, S&#227;o Paulo, Brazil) was set up and the instruments were placed inside after temperature had reached 170&#176;C. Then after the temperature was stabilized again, a 60 min countdown began. The sterilization efficacy for both treatments was checked by placing an envelope containing spores of Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus stearothermophylus in into the oven (Olidef, Ind. e Com. Equip Odontol&#243;gicos, S&#227;o Paulo, Brazil) and autoclave (Dabi Atlantis, Atlante Ind Medico Dental, S&#227;o Paulo, Brazil), respectively. After the sterilization cycle, the strip was removed from the equipment and placed in culture medium (Tryptic Broth, Difco Laboratories, Detroit, Michigan, USA). After 24 h, it was possible to verify the efficiency of the sterilization process based on the turbidity of the medium. The oven temperature was monitored continuously using a mercury thermometer, in order to keep it constant.Both types of curettes were distributed into groups, as shown in Table 1.The corrosion inhibitor 2% sodium nitrite (Phloracea, Farm Manip. Ltda, Cuiab&#225;, Mato Grosso, Brazil) was applied to CS curettes prior to autoclaving. The CS curettes were immersed for 2 min in the inhibitor and subsequently sterilized in an autoclave. SRP were performed in groups SS4, SS5, CS5 and CS6 in three human premolars extracted for orthodontic purposes, which were originated from the bank of teeth of the Discipline of Endodontics, University of Taubate. 50 short, strong traction movements were performed parallel to the tooth axis in a given area. After this procedure, each group of curettes underwent 10 consecutive sterilization cycles.Initially, curettes were assessed after the use and before sterilization by means of a SEM (Leo model 1450 VP, Leo-Zeiss, England). A disc of carborundum was used to separate the blades from the grips of the SS curettes to be observed by SEM. This procedure was not necessary in CS curettes as these have threaded tips. Hence, a better positioning of the active tips was obtained inside the SEM. Photomicrographs of the blades with 60 and &#215;100 magnification and 20 kV potency were taken.The method of analysis followed the methodology proposed by Stach et al.16 Previously calibrated examiners compared the micrograph of each treatment performed in the curettes with those obtained for the control group and provided scores according to the following scale: (1) No alteration; (2) minor and well-marked alteration; (3) moderate to major alteration. After analysis, the median of these indices was determined, and the results were analyzed.\nResults\nVisible changes in the edges of the curettes were observed by 10 examiners and classified according to the scale as shown in Table 2.Scale for analysis: (1) No alteration; (2) minor alteration; (3) moderate to major alteration.Figure 1a-k illustrates the conditions of the curettes after the different treatments by the magnification of &#215;100.\nDiscussion\nSterilization of instruments is a routine in the dental office, and repeated sterilization cycles can lead to undesirable changes in the physical properties of the instruments, such as corrosion, temper shifts and loss of structure.17 Autoclave sterilization is used in most materials, although it is found to cause changes in the physical properties of CS instruments.11 Oven sterilization is preferable to maintain the cutting edge of instruments and being microbiologically effective, but it requires high temperatures and long exposure periods.8 There are different types of packaging for sterilization of instruments in oven and autoclave. The corrosion of instruments increases considerably when CS samples are autoclaved in different business envelopes, with an increase in the release of acid radicals of the package. Sasse15 verified that 100% light cotton fabric was the package that caused the lowest corrosion rates. The present study used the same type of material for the packaging of curettes for sterilization.As Tal et al.6 reported that the cutting edge of the periodontal instrument was described as a well-defined, sharp edge, with a continuous line formed by two adjacent surfaces. This study found that CS curettes are more resistant to SRP procedure than are SS curettes. Geaman and Moser12 observed that SS instruments are more resistant to corrosion. In contrast, CS instruments stand superior with regard to the hardness of the material and maintenance of cutting edge for a longer time. In the present study, CS instruments lost their cutting on the seventh cycle (sterilization, SRP). SS instruments, in its turn, lost their cutting on the fifth cycle.Some authors have pointed out that sterilization of CS instruments using saturated vapor causes corrosion due to moisture and heat, that is why an inhibitor of corrosion was used in this study, prior to autoclaving.4,18In this study, the results showed that the CS curettes, subjected to autoclave sterilization, suffered severe degradation of their cutting edges and oxidation. This might have occurred because CS materials, unlike SS materials, do not have elements like nickel and chromium in their composition, which provide protection against corrosion. However, when an anticorrosive agent was used prior to sterilization, there was discrete oxidation and staining.10 Bertolotti and Hurst19 studied the effects of corrosion inhibitors (sodium nitrite, orthophosphate nitrite, and sodium perborate) applied to drills by dipping for 2 min. The authors concluded that 2% sodium nitrite was the most effective inhibitor against corrosion. According to these authors, corrosion is a destructive attack of the metal by an electrochemical reaction with the environment, where iron steel is converted into ferrous oxide (Fe + H2O - Fe (OH)2 + H2) in the presence of oxygen and water. The ferrous hydroxide is converted to ferric hydroxide (4Fe (OH)2 + O22H2O &#8722; 4 Fe (OH)3), After drying, the ferric hydroxide is converted to ferric oxide (2Fe (OH)3 &#8722; Fe2O3+ H2O), which leads to oxidation on the instrument surface. In the present study, an anticorrosive agent was used prior to autoclave sterilization. The instruments were immersed for 2 min in a solution of 2% sodium nitrite; this solution in small amounts is non-toxic and does not interfere with the sterilization process. The SS curettes had their cutting edges deformed before SRP, which is inherent to an inadequate manufacturing process.\nConclusion\nBased on the methodology and the results, it was possible to conclude that:\nThe edges of the SS curettes suffered little or no alteration after repeated sterilization cycles. However, after SRP, we observed the formation of dark regions (staining) and early formation of oxidesSS instruments were found to have their edges deformed before SRP, which seems to be inherent to the manufacturing processWhen a corrosion inhibitor (2% sodium nitrite) was applied to CS curettes prior to autoclaving, there was a discrete alteration or corrosion compared to autoclaving without using the inhibitorCS instruments subjected to oven sterilization cycles, SRP was the group with the lowest alteration of the cutting edges.\n", "pmid": "26028893", "title": "Effect of Repeated Sterilization Cycles on the Physical Properties of Scaling Instruments: A Scanning Electron Microscopy Study", "journal_title": "Journal of International Oral Health : JIOH", "authors": "Alessandra Nogueira Porto;\u00c1lvaro Henrique Borges;Alex Semenoff-Segundo;Suzane A Raslan;F\u00e1bio Luis Miranda Pedro;Ant\u00f4nio Olavo Cardoso Jorge;Matheus Coelho Bandeca", "score": "0.02728284"}, {"keywords": "Neoplasms;Cancer;Radiation Therapy;Pelvic Radiation Therapy;Urinary Tract Infection;Cystitis;Incidence;Cohort Studies;Prospective Study;Controlled Study", "abstract": "OBJECTIVES:\nThe purpose of this study was to evaluate the incidence of urinary tract infection (UTI) in patients with cystitis symptoms who underwent pelvic radiation therapy and identify correlated predictive factors.METHODS:\nA prospective cohort study was conducted of patients who met the following: primary pelvic cancer treated with curative intent, older than 18 years old, and good performance status.

Due to the effect of radiation on epithelial cells, acute functional alterations, including increased urinary frequency, dysuria and hematuria, can occur and may mimic the secondary symptoms of urinary tract infection (UTI) (1).The diagnosis of UTI is typically performed in the general population based on signs and symptoms of cystitis, such as dysuria, polyuria, urinary urgency, suprapubic pain, and leukocyturia or bacteriuria in a biochemical analysis of the urine sample, in the absence of vaginal symptoms in women (2,3). When these findings are observed, empirical antibiotic therapy is frequently initiated, especially in women, while waiting for confirmation by urinary culture (3).Although this approach has been established for women in the community, it probably cannot be applied in individuals undergoing pelvic radiation therapy. Usually, this population has secondary cystitis symptoms resulting from the cancer or its treatment (4-6). In addition, it has been estimated that alterations observed on urinalysis, such as a high level of leukocytes, a classic predictor of infectious cystitis, may also be present in radiation cystitis (7). Approximately half of patients with localized prostate cancer who underwent radiation therapy with external beam irradiation present urinary symptoms during treatment (5,6,8). However, the estimated incidence of UTI in patients submitted to pelvic radiation therapy varies from 6% to 45% (9-11).Generally, the assessment of UTI incidence is considered a secondary outcome; hence, no methodology is implemented to exclude biases associated with this diagnosis (12). Thus, there may be a low correlation between cystitis symptoms and the presence of UTI in this population.Currently, no available evidence is helpful in clinically distinguishing infectious and radiation cystitis. The signs, symptoms and biochemical urine analysis commonly used in the general population to diagnose UTI probably are not applicable in the population submitted to pelvic radiation therapy. This could lead to excessive use of resources, which could generate costs in propaedeutics and compromise patient safety by leading to the excessive use of antibiotics.The purposes of this study were to evaluate the incidence of UTI among patients with symptoms of cystitis during pelvic radiation therapy and identify possible correlated predictive factors.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nA prospective cohort study was performed in patients submitted to pelvic radiation therapy. The study was approved by the respective Ethics in Research Committees of the Hospital das Cl&#237;nicas of the Faculty of Medicine of the University of S&#227;o Paulo (HC-FMUSP) and the Cancer Institute of the State of S&#227;o Paulo (ICESP). All patients who agreed to participate in the study signed an informed consent form.The inclusion criteria were patients with prostate, rectal, anal canal, uterine cervix, or endometrial cancer who underwent pelvic radiation therapy with curative intent and had a performance status less than or equal to 2 (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group - ECOG) (13). Patients using antibiotics or urinary catheters in the 30 days prior to or during radiation therapy and patients on dialysis or with cystostomy or nephrostomy were excluded.On the day of radiotherapy simulation, urine samples were collected for urinalysis and urine cultures from the eligible patients who agreed to participate in the study. During treatment, urinary symptoms were assessed in weekly routine evaluations with the nursing and medical staff. The specific protocol of the study included an evaluation of the main urinary symptoms related to the treatment, which were graded according to Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) scores (14). Briefly, urinary symptoms, such as urinary frequency, nocturia, dysuria, and urgency, were graded from 0 (zero) or none to 4 (worse). The patients were followed up during treatment. In the event of the appearance of urinary symptoms or worsening of preexisting symptoms, a questionnaire (Appendix) was applied to analyze possible risk factors, and a second urinalysis and culture were performed. The diagnosis of UTI was established when a urinary culture showed bacterial growth greater than 104 CFU/mL (Gelose chromID&#174;).\nStatistical Analysis\nData in the literature show that the incidence of dysuria is approximately 50% among patients submitted to pelvic irradiation and that the rate of UTI varies from 6% to 45% in this population (7-10). The sample size of this study was calculated based on a 50% incidence of dysuria and a 10% incidence of UTI. Considering that approximately 10 cases per variable were needed for the multiple regression analysis, five variables were pragmatically chosen for the analysis. Thus, 50 events of UTI would be necessary so that an initial sample of 1,000 patients, which was calculated to contain at least 500 symptomatic patients was required.Descriptive and frequency analyses were used to describe and systematize all the data obtained during this study. A multivariate regression analysis was planned to identify factors that could predict the risk of infection and provide early guidelines for clinical outcomes.\nRESULTS\nFrom September 2014 to November 2015, 112 patients were recruited, and an interim analysis was then conducted. Among the recruited patients, 29 were excluded because they did not perform the first requested urinalysis type I exam and uroculture, as were 11 patients who had a first positive urinary culture. Thus, a total of 72 patients were included and evaluated. Of these, 24 (33%) presented urinary symptoms during irradiation, only one (4%) of whom had a positive urinary culture.Due to the lower than expected incidence of symptomatic patients and especially the low incidence of UTI found in the study, which was much lower than that used for the sample calculation, patient recruitment was interrupted, and the initially proposed regression analysis of UTI-predictive factors was aborted.The patients included in the study were mostly male (60%) and older than 40 years old (98%). Prostate and rectal cancers were more prevalent, at 36% and 31%, respectively. The proportions of asymptomatic (51%) and symptomatic (49%) patients were similar before treatment. Urinary urgency was the most reported symptom (63%). Table 1 shows the patients&#8217; characteristics.During radiation therapy, only 24 (33%) patients presented symptoms. The 48 patients who remained asymptomatic were not submitted to any further urine exams. Patients with primary anal canal cancer presented a higher rate of symptoms (67%; 2/3 patients). Approximately one-third of the patients with primary uterine cervix cancer, prostate cancer, and rectal cancer also presented symptoms, while the four patients with endometrial tumors did not present any symptoms (Table 2).Regarding the treatment technique, all patients received external beam irradiation in the pelvis, and only 13 (18%) patients with gynecological tumors underwent intracavitary brachytherapy. The doses of external beam irradiation ranged from 45 Gy to 78 Gy in fractions of 1.8 to 2 Gy/day. Brachytherapy doses were 20 Gy across 4 fractions of 5 Gy each on the vaginal vault surface (postoperative treatment) or 30 Gy across 4 fractions of 7.50 Gy each at point A for definitive treatment.Among the patients who presented symptoms, 29% were treated with tridimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT), 50% with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), and only three patients were submitted to brachytherapy (Table 2). In 75% of the patients, the beginning or worsening of the preexisting symptoms started after a median dose of 32.4 Gy (range, 15 to 45 Gy) of external beam radiotherapy. The great majority of the patients (83%) presented dysuria as the symptom that required the second urinary culture. No hematuria or urinary urgency was reported (Table 2).\nDISCUSSION\nThis study was proposed and designed to provide the maximum information regarding urinary symptoms and infection in the population submitted to pelvic radiation therapy. The study design was established to control possible biases related to the definite diagnosis of UTI through positive urinary culture. The aim of this study was to provide guidance for propaedeutics and therapeutics of these patients.The estimated incidence of acute urinary symptoms in the population submitted to pelvic radiation therapy is widely variable. Values between 25% and 83% are usually described (5,6,10,12,16). A 50% incidence was initially considered for the sample calculation. In our study, 33% (24/72) of the patients presented symptoms, a value that was lower than expected. We attribute this relatively low incidence to the fact that patients were treated with 3D-CRT or IMRT, which are better than conventional bidimensional treatments at normal tissue-sparing (6).At the 14th month of recruitment, a low number (24) of symptomatic patients was observed, and after an interim analysis, enrollment was interrupted. Thus, it was not possible to perform the evaluation of possible predictive factors for UTI that was originally planned. Therefore, we evaluated the data in a descriptive way.The higher incidences of prostate and rectal cancers among males and uterine cervix cancer among females in our country (2) reflect the prevalence of these tumors in the study population.Paradoxically, patients submitted to IMRT, a technique that allows better normal tissue sparing with less toxicity than is caused by 3D-CRT (1,16), presented a higher incidence of symptoms. However, in our daily routine, this technique is reserved for cases of anal canal cancers, patients who need higher doses for tumor control (such as those with prostate cancer), and those with unfavorable anatomy for the sparing of surrounding organs at risk (e.g., bladder cancer) with 3D-CRT.In our study, only patients with gynecological tumors underwent intracavitary brachytherapy. It seems intuitive that these patients would be more prone than other to develop urinary symptoms due to the high dose of irradiation applied to the region near the bladder as well as the need for a bladder catheter during each procedure (7). However, compared to other techniques, these patients had a lower incidence of symptoms, at only 3/13 (23%). The other 10 patients underwent treatment without urinary complaints.In accordance with the average lifetime of mature cells of the bladder and urethral epithelium (9), new symptoms or the worsening of preexisting ones were observed in patients who received a median dose of 32.4 Gy after approximately 2 to 3 weeks of radiation therapy.Urinary symptoms resulting from radiation therapy are usually reported on a generic genitourinary toxicity scale, such as an RTOG score (14). Dysuria was the most reported symptom and triggered a request for the second examination in 83% of affected cases, resulting in an incidence of 28% among treated patients (20/72).At least two recent studies have prospectively assessed the incidence of UTI among the population undergoing pelvic radiation therapy. Both aimed to evaluate the effects of cranberry ingestion in controlling cystitis symptoms and the incidence of UTI. Bonneta et al. (10) evaluated 370 patients who underwent pelvic radiation therapy and found a UTI incidence of 24.2%. Cowan et al. (15) performed a randomized trial with 128 patients who took a placebo or cranberry. The incidence of UTI among this population was 44.1%. Although the incidence of UTI was high in these studies, no urinary evaluation was performed before treatment. The absence of a urinalysis control before the beginning of treatment may have contributed to the high incidence of UTI among the study population as several of these patients could have been carriers of asymptomatic bacteriuria.Only two other studies have performed a prospective evaluation of the population involving type I urinalysis and urine culture in all patients prior to treatment. Bialas et al. (9) evaluated 172 patients in 1989 and prospectively observed that the prevalence of positive uroculture was 17% prior to radiotherapy and 17% during treatment. In a 1994 study, Prasad et al. (11) prospectively evaluated patients with primary gynecological tumors. They found that the risk of UTI was higher among those submitted to cystoscopy prior to radiation therapy and bladder catheterization in intracavitary brachytherapy. Weekly urinary cultures were performed without symptom assessment, and 10% of the patients presented with a positive urinary culture before the beginning of treatment, while 23% presented with positive results during radiation therapy.In their study, Shuford et al. (7) evaluated the urine exams of 134 women with primary pelvic tumors treated with pelvic radiation therapy. The purpose was to identify urine analysis parameters that could predict UTI with urinary culture used as the gold standard. However, theirs was a retrospective study without an assessment of urinary status prior to the beginning of treatment. Therefore, their results may contain the same biases found in previous studies regarding patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria.In our study, all 112 of the evaluated patients underwent urinary culture prior to the beginning treatment, and 10% were identified as already having a positive urinary culture, a value close to those of the previous 2 studies that performed this evaluation prior to treatment. We decided to exclude these patients in advance because we sought to evaluate the actual incidence of UTI during treatment.When we compared the incidence of UTI during treatment obtained in this study to those obtained in previous studies that included a control urinary culture performed prior to the beginning of radiation therapy, we found that ours was much lower. While Bialas et al. and Prassad et al. reported incidences of 17% and 23%, respectively, ours was only 4% (one patient). This difference may be because the two previous studies performed weekly urinary culture exams in all patients regardless of the presence or absence of symptoms.We consider, therefore, that the 4% incidence of UTI detected in our study is well below that found in the previous literature mainly due to two factors. The first factor is that we performed urinary culture exams before radiation therapy and excluded patients with positive results. The second is that we investigated only patients with urinary symptoms. Thus, we excluded patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria and investigated only those who became suspicious for UTI due to the presence of symptoms.Based on these results, we conclude that the frequency of UTI reported to date actually reflects the incidence of patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria who developed secondary symptoms due to radiation therapy and were erroneously classified as having a UTI based on the classic criteria used for patients in the community.Our results are extremely important for clinical practice. The low incidence of UTI found in our study should prompt a discussion about the application of the clinical diagnostic criteria for UTIs used in patients undergoing pelvic radiation therapy. The frequency of false diagnoses appears to generate excessive empirical treatments in this population.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first prospectively controlled study to analyze the real incidence of UTI among the population treated with pelvic radiation therapy. The very low incidence found in this study highlights the importance of using the correct approach in these patients to avoid excessive diagnoses, expenses related to propaedeutics and the application of unnecessary empirical treatments in this population, which can even lead to antimicrobial resistance. Our results should not only stimulate efforts aimed at avoiding empirical treatments, such as antibiotics, in this population but also demonstrate that it is safe to wait for the results of uroculture analysis before selecting the appropriate antibiotic therapy in patients without neutropenia and fever.\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nXavier VF was responsible for the study conceptualization, data curation, formal analysis, investigation, methodology and project administration.

Although DNA methylation is hypothesized to be a mechanism by which both genetic and non-genetic factors can influence the regulation of gene expression, little is known about the extent to which DNA methylation at specific sites is influenced by heritable as well as environmental factors. We quantified DNA methylation in whole blood at age 18 in a birth cohort of 1,464 individuals comprising 426 monozygotic (MZ) and 306 same-sex dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs. Site-specific levels of DNA methylation were more strongly correlated across the genome between MZ than DZ twins.

By comparing concordance rates between monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins it has been shown that most human traits are, at least in part, influenced by DNA sequence variation [2]. The fact that genetically-identical MZ twins exhibit phenotypic differences indicates that non-sequence based factors, usually attributed to the environment, also contribute to phenotypic variation. Increasing knowledge about the biology of the genome has stimulated interest in the role of epigenetic processes&#8212;acting to developmentally regulate gene expression via modifications to DNA, histone proteins, and chromatin&#8212;in mediating phenotypic variation across the life-course. Growing evidence identifies epigenetic differences between MZ twins [3], and epigenetic variation is associated with a range of health and disease phenotypes [4].The primary focus of epigenetic epidemiology is on DNA methylation, the best-characterized and most stable epigenetic modification, which is assumed to influence gene expression via the disruption of transcription factor binding and the attraction of methyl-binding proteins that initiate chromatin compaction and gene silencing. DNA methylation can be influenced by both environmental and genetic factors, meaning that careful study design in epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) is important to minimize the influence of confounders and false positives [4, 5]. There is evidence that certain exposures&#8211;for example, to tobacco smoke [6&#8211;8], dietary factors [9, 10] and psychosocial stress [11, 12]&#8211;are associated with changes in DNA methylation at specific sites across the genome. Likewise, studies have identified associations between DNA sequence variation and DNA methylation at sites across the genome [13&#8211;16]; these DNA methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTLs) often overlap with DNA variants associated with levels of gene expression (expression quantitative trait loci; eQTLs)[14, 17], providing a potential mechanism linking genetic variation to gene regulation.Researchers are starting to exploit the twin study design to further explore the extent to which epigenetic variation between individuals is influenced by genetic and environmental factors. Recent studies have shown that DNA methylation profiles are more similar between related individuals than unrelated individuals, with greater concordance between MZ than DZ twins [18, 19]. Twin studies suggest that the proportion of variance in DNA methylation explained by genetic factors is on average low (typically 5&#8211;19%) at the majority of sites that have been tested across the genome [19&#8211;21]. Importantly, however, the contribution of genetic and environmental factors to DNA methylation varies at sites across the genome, and potentially differs as a function of tissue, age and sex [21]. Studies investigating associations between DNA methylation and phenotypic variation, should not dismiss the impact that genetic variation may have on their results.Here we report findings about the genetic and environmental architecture of DNA methylation in whole blood at age 18 years using samples collected from the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study, a representative birth cohort of young-adult twins based in the UK. Young adulthood is a life stage when people show great variation in health risk behaviors and exposures that have been hypothesized to alter an individuals&#8217; epigenome. Our goal was to characterize the genetic and environmental determinants of variation in DNA methylation in order to inform future methylomic analyses of complex traits. By analyzing a sample where all twin pairs provided a whole blood sample at the same age, we minimize the confounding influence of age-associated variation.We first used structural equation modeling to calculate the proportion of variance in DNA methylation explained by additive genetic (A), shared environmental (C) and unshared (or unique) environmental (E) factors at sites across the genome. Second, we explored whether the contribution of genetic and environmental influences on DNA methylation differs depending upon the level and/or variability in DNA methylation at individual sites. Third, we assessed how genetic and environmental influences on DNA methylation differ as a function of genic location, describing the factors influencing variable DNA methylation across gene regulatory regions. Fourth, we tested the hypothesis that sites characterized by highly heritable levels of DNA methylation are enriched for known mQTL effects. Fifth, we explored the extent to which biological phenotype estimates derived from DNA methylation data itself (e.g. age and blood cell proportions) are influenced by genetic and environmental factors, in addition to estimating the genetic and non-genetic contribution to levels of DNA methylation at sites robustly associated with specific environmental exposures (e.g. tobacco smoking and obesity). Finally, as a resource for the research community, we present a searchable database cataloguing the genetic and environmental contributions to variable DNA methylation across all sites on the Illumina 450K array (http://www.epigenomicslab.com/online-data-resources).\nResults\n\nSite-specific levels of DNA methylation are more strongly correlated between MZ twins than DZ twins, especially at sites with variable and intermediate levels of DNA methylation\nWe quantified genome-wide patterns of DNA methylation using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (&#8220;450K array&#8221;) in DNA samples isolated from whole blood collected at age 18 years from members of the E-Risk cohort [22]. After implementing a stringent quality control (QC) pipeline (see Methods), our final sample included 426 MZ twin pairs (48.5% female) and 306 DZ twin pairs (49.2% female) (1,464 individuals, a representative 65.6% of participants, see Methods).We first assessed the profile of DNA methylation across all 420,857 autosomal 450K array sites included in our final dataset. As expected, these &#8216;global&#8217; patterns of DNA methylation were highly stable between individuals (S1 Fig), although the average inter-individual correlation of DNA methylation across sites was significantly higher between siblings than between unrelated individuals (P = 2.20x10-223). MZ twin pairs were more similar to each other than DZ twin pairs for the majority of sites tested (N = 277,077 (65.8%), sign test P = 1.98x10-323) (Fig 1); the average sibling correlation across the 420,857 sites was significantly higher for MZ twin-pairs than for DZ pairs (mean MZ sibling correlation = 0.996, mean DZ sibling correlation = 0.995, P = 1.29x10-34). The magnitude of this difference was relatively small, reflecting the fact that most autosomal 450K array probes are characterized by consistently high (>80%) or low (<20%) levels of DNA methylation, and minimal inter-individual variation. We therefore estimated sibling correlations for the subset of autosomal DNA methylation sites we defined as either &#8220;variable&#8221; (i.e. those where the range of DNA methylation values for the middle 80% of individuals was greater than 5%; N = 214,991 sites (51.1%)) or with intermediate levels of DNAm (i.e. those where the mean level of DNA methylation was between 20% and 80%; N = 131,728 sites (31.3%)) (see Methods). These probe subsets were not distinct; the majority (N = 127,935 (97.1%)) of DNA methylation sites with intermediate levels of DNAm were also classed as &#8220;variable&#8221; (S2 Fig). The elevated concordance in DNA methylation levels in MZ twins compared to DZ twins was more pronounced amongst both &#8220;variable&#8221; sites (number of sites at which MZ twin pairs are more similar to each other than DZ twin pairs = 166,783 (77.6%), sign test P = 1.48x10-323) and sites with intermediate levels of DNAm (number of sites at which MZ twin pairs are more similar to each other than DZ twin pairs = 109,303 (83.0%), sign test P = 9.88x10-324) (Fig 1). Furthermore, there was an overall elevated average sibling similarity for DNA methylation levels in MZ twins compared to DZ twins amongst both &#8220;variable&#8221; DNA methylation sites (mean MZ sibling correlation = 0.989, mean DZ sibling correlation = 0.985, P = 3.92x10-38) and DNA methylation sites with intermediate levels of DNAm (mean MZ sibling correlation = 0.979, mean DZ sibling correlation = 0.968, P = 1.55x10-39) (S1 Fig), consistent with findings from previous twin studies of DNA methylation in whole blood [21, 23].\nAutosomal DNA methylation is predominantly influenced by non-shared environmental factors\nDNA methylation is widely hypothesized to be a mechanism by which both heritable and environmental factors can influence the regulation of gene expression and function, but little is known about the extent to which DNA methylation at specific sites is actually influenced by genetic and non-genetic factors. We fitted structural equation models to estimate the proportion of variance in DNA methylation explained by additive genetic effects (A), shared environmental effects (C) and unshared (or unique) environmental effects (E) across all 420,857 autosomal sites (see Methods) (Table 1). The average contribution of additive genetic effects across all DNA methylation sites was relatively low but highly variable (mean A = 15.9% (SD = 20.8%)) (Fig 2A&#8211;2C); our mean estimate of heritability was slightly below that observed in previous studies of older and more variably-aged twin-pairs [19, 23]. On average, the largest contribution to variation in DNA methylation was attributable to unique environmental influences, which also indexes measurement error (mean E = 67.4% (SD = 22.9%)). The mean estimate for common environmental influences across all 420,857 autosomal sites was similar to that for additive genetic effects (mean C = 16.7% (SD = 17.8%)). These data highlight that variation in DNA methylation can be influenced by both genetic and non-genetic factors, and that the relative importance of these influences differs across sites in the genome. Because whole blood is a heterogeneous tissue, we derived blood cell proportion estimates for each sample using the DNAm data (see Methods) and repeated our structural equation modelling in an attempt to explore the effects of cellular heterogeneity on heritability estimates of DNAm. Including derived blood cell-types as a covariate in our model did not change the pattern of results (mean A = 16.5% (SD = 21.2%), mean C = 12.6% (SD = 13.7%), mean E = 71.0% (SD = 20.9%)) (S3 Fig), with estimates for genetic and environmental influences on DNAm across sites being highly correlated across both models (S4 Fig). Fig 3 shows examples of sites at which the level of DNA methylation was influenced by a high (Fig 3A) and low (Fig 3B) additive genetic component. MZ and DZ twin correlations and estimates for A, C, and E for all Illumina 450K array sites are available as an online resource at http://www.epigenomicslab.com/online-data-resources).\nAdditive genetic influences on DNA methylation are highest at highly variable sites and sites with intermediate levels of DNAm\nWe next tested the hypothesis that DNA methylation at sites which are &#8220;variable&#8221; or have intermediate levels of DNAm is more highly heritable than other sites in the genome. Average additive genetic influences on DNA methylation were markedly higher at &#8220;variable&#8221; autosomal sites compared to non-variable sites (mean A = 23.0% (SD = 23.8%), Mann Whitney P < 2.2x10-16) (Fig 2D and S5 Fig). Likewise, additive genetic influences on DNA methylation were significantly higher at autosomal sites with intermediate levels of DNAm compared to hyper/hypo-methylated sites (mean A = 27.3% (SD = 24.6%), Mann Whitney P < 2.2x10-16), with a striking inverted U-shaped relationship between the level of DNA methylation and the extent to which it was influenced by additive genetic factors (Fig 2G and Fig 4). In contrast, the influence of non-shared environmental factors was significantly lower at &#8220;variable&#8221; autosomal sites compared to non-variable sites (mean E = 61.1% (SD = 23.2%); Mann-Whitney P < 2.2x10-16) (Fig 2F). The contribution of non-shared environmental factors was also lower at autosomal sites with intermediate levels of DNAm compared to either hyper- or hypo-methylated sites (mean E = 55.9% (SD = 22.3%); Mann-Whitney P < 2.2x10-16) (Fig 2I); there is a U-shaped relationship between the mean level of DNA methylation and the proportion of variance explained by unique environmental effects; the smallest contribution of E was observed at sites that were 56&#8211;58% methylated (Fig 4). Shared environmental influences were fairly stable and not strongly affected by either the average variability or level of DNA methylation. These results are important because they suggest that the effects of genetic variants associated with phenotypic differences are likely to be more pronounced at DNA methylation sites that are variable or have intermediate levels of DNAm compared to hypo- or hyper methylated sites, which are more stable in the population and often associated with cell-type-specific patterns of gene expression.\nGenetic influences on DNA methylation are not evenly distributed across genic regions\nAlthough DNA methylation across CpG-rich promoter regions is often associated with the repression of gene expression, recent work has revealed a more nuanced relationship between DNA methylation and transcription that is frequently dependent on genomic context [24]. DNA methylation in the gene body, for example, can be a marker of active gene transcription [25, 26], potentially playing a role in regulating alternative splicing and isoform diversity. Given these contextual differences, we tested whether genetic and environmental contributions to variable DNA methylation differ across genomic domains. As DNAm sites located in specific gene features differ in their variability, these analyses focused on our subset of &#8220;variable&#8221; DNAm sites to prevent any potential confounding. First, we used a sliding-window approach to examine how the proportion of variation in DNA methylation explained by genetic and environmental influences changes across a canonical gene region (S6 Fig). There was a peak in the contribution of shared environmental influences in the vicinity of the transcription start site (TSS), accompanied by a reduction in the contribution of non-shared environmental influences. The contribution of additive genetic factors to variation in DNA methylation was highest at sites located immediately upstream of the TSS, and also in a region spanning ~5 kilobases (kb) downstream of the transcription termination site. Second, we tested the extent to which DNA methylation levels at sites annotated to specific genic features (S7 Fig) and CpG island features (S8 Fig) were influenced by additive genetic or environmental factors. Variation in DNA methylation at sites in the immediate vicinity of a TSS, or annotated to a first exon or CpG island, were associated with significantly higher additive genetic and shared environmental influences (all Mann-Whitney P < 2.2x10-16) (S1 Table). Given the presumed importance of promoter-region DNA methylation in regulating gene expression, these observations suggest that both environmental and genetic factors can influence transcriptional regulation via DNA methylation at these promoter-region locations and that, on average, the effects across features are relatively consistent. Finally, we investigated how the influence of genetic and environmental factors on DNAm varies across regulatory features and chromatin states defined by ChromHMM using ENCODE ChIP-seq data for a well-characterized lymphoblastoid cell line (GM12878) (S9 Fig). This analysis revealed higher levels of additive genetic effects on DNAm at sites in insulators (mean A = 23.0%, SD = 24.2%), repressed (mean A = 19.6%, SD = 21.4%) and repetitive/CNV regions (mean A = 24.8&#8211;27.0%, SD = 25.8&#8211;26.2%), with moderate levels of heritability in enhancer regions (mean A = 17.5&#8211;19.1%, SD = 20.9&#8211;22.1%). In contrast, DNAm at sites located in promoters is characterized by an increased proportion of variance explained by unique environmental factors (E = 65.6&#8211;67.8%, SD = 22.3&#8211;23.2%) reflecting the genic annotation results above.\nSites at which variable DNA methylation is strongly influenced by additive genetic factors are significantly enriched for mQTL effects\nGiven that epigenetic epidemiology aims to understand both the causes and phenotypic consequences of differential DNA methylation, we focused our subsequent analyses on the subset of 214,991 &#8220;variable&#8221; autosomal DNA methylation sites. Hypothesizing that the majority of heritable DNA methylation sites identified in this study are influenced by common genetic variation, we tested whether they were enriched for mQTL effects, i.e. common genetic variants known to be robustly associated with DNA methylation at specific sites [13, 27, 28]. We used a large mQTL database generated by our group on an independent set of whole blood samples [29] to identify overlap with the most highly heritable DNA methylation sites (defined as those with A > 0.8; n = 4,882) identified in the E-Risk cohort. DNA methylation at 84.7% of these sites was significantly associated with at least one common genetic variant using a stringent mQTL threshold (P < 1x10-8) (S2 Table); this represented a highly significant enrichment for mQTL effects (P < 2.2x10-16) compared to less-heritable DNA methylation sites (defined as those with A < 0.8), amongst which only 24.5% were associated with a mQTL variant. Of note, mQTL effect sizes vary as a function of the mean level of DNAm. Sites with intermediate levels of DNAm are associated with larger mQTL effects (mean = 4.99% change in methylation per allele (SD = 3.61%)) compared to sites characterized as being hyper- or hypo-methylated (mean = 3.56% change in methylation per allele (SD = 2.79%); Mann-Whitney P < 2.2x10-16); this parallels the relationship observed between the level of DNAm and the influence of additive genetic factors (S10 Fig). These findings suggest that the incorporation of common SNP data into epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) will facilitate understanding about the contribution of genetic and non-genetic factors to trait-associated methylomic variation. An example of a highly heritable DNA methylation site (cg02573566, A = 96.9%) that was also associated with an mQTL SNP (rs11548104, P = 5.95x10-179) is shown in S11 Fig. Of note, observed DNA methylation at highly heritable sites for which we did not detect an mQTL (15.3%) does not necessarily signal false positives as these sites may be associated with rare variation or larger structural variants not assessed in existing mQTL databases. mQTLs influencing levels of DNA methylation at highly heritable sites were associated with larger effects (mean change in DNA methylation per allele = 6.77% (SD = 4.48%)) compared to all identified mQTLs (mean change in DNA methylation per allele = 3.03% (SD = 3.10%)) (P = < 2.2x10-16). Across all autosomal 450K array sites, there was a relatively linear relationship between the contribution of genetic influences to variation in DNA methylation and the proportion of sites influenced by an mQTL (S12 Fig). In contrast, the proportion of DNA methylation sites that were associated with an mQTL decreased as the contribution of the common or unique environment to levels of DNA methylation increased. Taken together, these findings confirm our hypothesis that DNA methylation at the majority of highly heritable sites is directly influenced by common genetic variants.\nDNA methylation sites at which inter-individual variation is correlated across tissues are characterized by higher levels of heritability\nEpigenetic association studies of phenotypes where the presumed tissue of interest is challenging to obtain (e.g. regions of the human brain) typically use more accessible peripheral tissues (e.g. whole blood) under the premise that variation identified in these &#8216;proxy&#8217; tissues potentially mirrors that in the disease-relevant tissue. We have previously shown, however, that whole blood generally has limited utility for inferring inter-individual variation in multiple regions of the human brain [30]. Where there is significant co-variation between two tissues from the same individual, we hypothesized that this is likely to reflect genetic effects on DNA methylation that are manifest across tissues. We used the matched blood and brain DNA methylation datasets, previously generated by our group [30], to confirm that DNA methylation at sites characterized by high inter-individual co-variation across tissues from the same individual is more likely to be influenced by heritable factors. For example, we observed a striking increase in the heritability of DNA methylation at the subset of sites at which inter-individual variation in our prior sample was strongly correlated between whole blood and the prefrontal cortex (covariation between blood and prefrontal cortex > 0.5, N = 9,212 sites) compared to those at which variation was less correlated across tissues (median A = 71.1% vs 14.7%, Mann-Whitney P < 2.2x10-16) (Fig 5A). Overall, there was a strong positive correlation (r = 0.500) between the additive genetic contribution to DNA methylation and tissue co-variation (blood vs prefrontal cortex) across variably methylated sites (S13 Fig), confirming that sites at which DNA methylation co-varies across tissues are more likely to be influenced by heritable factors. Similar effects were seen for the other brain regions profiled from the same individual donors (entorhinal cortex, superior temporal gyrus and cerebellum). An example of a site where DNA methylation significantly covaries between whole blood and brain, and is strongly influenced by additive genetic effects, is shown in Fig 5B&#8211;5H. These results are important because they suggest that concerns regarding tissue-specific effects on DNA methylation are likely to be more relevant for studies of environmentally-induced variation as compared to analyses of genetic influences on DNA methylation.\nGenetic influences on DNA methylation at sites on the X chromosome are also highest at sites characterized by intermediate levels of DNAm and high variability\nBecause DNA methylation on the X-chromosome differs markedly between males and females&#8211;primarily due to its role in regulating the dosage compensation of X-linked genes (see S14 Fig)&#8212;the analyses presented above focused solely on autosomal DNA methylation sites. We next estimated the proportion of variance in DNA methylation explained by additive genetic effects, shared environmental effects and non-shared (or unique) environmental effects for probes on the X chromosome in male and female twins separately (male: 156 DZ twin pairs, 219 MZ twin pairs; female: 150 DZ twin pairs, 207 MZ twin pairs) (Table 1). As hypothesized, X-chromosome DNA methylation was much more variable in females than males; the majority (N = 9,127, 92.2%) of X-linked DNA methylation sites met our criteria for being &#8220;variable&#8221; in females compared to just over half (N = 5,377, 54.3%) in males. Most DNA methylation sites classified as &#8220;variable&#8221; in males were also found to be &#8220;variable&#8221; in females (N = 5,195; 96.6%). In males, the contribution of genetic and environmental influences to DNA methylation at sites on the X-chromosome was similar to that observed at autosomal loci; for males, more variation was attributed to unique environmental influences (mean = 69.4%, SD = 22.1%) than shared environmental (mean = 15.5%, SD = 18.5%) or additive genetic (mean = 15.0%, SD = 19.4%) influences (S15 Fig). Furthermore, the influence of additive genetic factors on male X-chromosome DNA methylation was highest at sites characterized by either &#8220;intermediate levels of DNAm&#8221; (S16 Fig) or &#8220;variable&#8221; levels of DNA methylation (S17 Fig). Although most variance in X-chromosome DNA methylation in females could also be attributed to the unique environment (mean E = 55.3%, SD = 21.7%), the average contribution of additive genetic factors (mean A = 31.3%, SD = 16.5%) was significantly higher compared to that observed at autosomal sites (P < 2.2x10-16) and X-linked sites in males (P < 2.2x10-16) (Table 1). While the influence of genetic and environmental factors on DNA methylation across sites on the X-chromosome was positively correlated between males and females (S18 Fig), with the strongest correlation seen for unique environmental influences (r = 0.381), there was some notable heterogeneity. A number of sites, for example, were characterized by sex-specific additive genetic influences on DNA methylation (S19 Fig and S20 Fig). These results are interesting as they could potentially mediate observed sex differences for certain inherited phenotypes. This heterogeneity of effects may also have negative effects on power for statistical significance in EWAS analyses that combine males and female samples to analyze sites on the X chromosome; to truly disentangle genetic and environmental effects on X-chromosome DNA methylation it is important to analyze the sexes separately. Finally, we examined the genetic and environmental contribution to variable DNAm across regions annotated to the small subset of genes known to escape X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) in females. Using RNA-seq data from the GTEx consortium [31] we selected DNAm sites annotated to the 5&#8217;UTR or within 1500 bp of the transcription start site of genes highlighted as escaping XCI. As expected, the distribution of DNAm across sites annotated to genes escaping XCI is dramatically different to other X-chromosome sites in females, with a striking enrichment of hypomethylated loci. Despite the differences in levels of DNAm associated with genes escaping XCI, the contribution of additive genetic and environmental influences on DNAm at these sites is broadly comparable to that seen at sites across the X-chromosome in females (S21 Fig).\nEstimates of chronological age and blood cell proportions derived from DNA methylation data are influenced by both genetic and environmental effects\nA number of classifiers can be used to derive estimates of biological phenotypes including age (DNAmAge) [32] and the proportion (or abundance) of different cell types present in whole blood [32&#8211;34] from DNA methylation data. These estimates are useful because they can be incorporated as covariates in EWAS analyses when empirical measures are missing, or used as interesting variables in their own right in epidemiological analyses [35&#8211;37]. We examined the twin correlations for each of these derived variables (S22 Fig) and estimated the contribution of additive genetic and environmental influences to these measures by comparing MZ and DZ twins (S23 Fig). The mean predicted DNAmAge of samples from participants in this study was 20.7 years (SD = 4.10 years), slightly higher and more variable that the actual age at sampling (mean = 18.4 years; SD = 0.37 years). As DNAmAge is associated with actual chronological age, age acceleration is typically calculated as the residual from a linear regression model of predicted age against reported age. Although the limited age variation in our sample provides limited power for structural equation modelling, we found that DNAmAge acceleration was characterized by an additive genetic contribution of 36.7%, with 42.8% and 20.5% of the variance explained by common environmental and unique environmental influences, respectively. This heritability estimate is lower than the 100% reported previously for age acceleration in a smaller set of newborns but comparable to the 39% reported for adult twin pairs (45&#8211;75 years old) [32]. The contribution of additive genetic and environmental influences differed dramatically across the predicted cellular heterogeneity variables, with heritability estimates ranging from 0% (for CD8 T cells and granulocytes) to 47.0% (for CD8+CD28-CD45RA- T cells) (S3 Table). For seven of the ten derived cell estimates, the largest proportion of variance was attributed to the influence of unique environmental factors. B cells had the largest proportion of variance estimated as being explained by common environmental factors (52.1%), and na&#239;ve CD8 T cells and natural killer cells had the largest proportion explained by genetic factors (at 42.1% and 40.0%, respectively). Comparison between these results and those for empirically-measured cell abundance data is not straightforward as in many cases the estimated cellular composition represents a proportion rather than abundance. Although, there is contradictory evidence in the literature about whether variation in specific blood cell types is more influenced by genetic or environmental factors[38&#8211;41], our results are consistent with reports that T cells have higher heritability estimates than B cells [38, 41].\nDNA methylation at sites robustly associated with exposure to tobacco smoking and body mass index (BMI) is strongly influenced by additive genetic effects\nSeveral environmental exposures have been robustly associated with differences in DNA methylation at specific sites across the genome, although the extent to which these relationships are potentially confounded by genetic influences is not known. We first examined whether variation in DNA methylation at sites associated with tobacco smoking&#8212;an exposure known to be characterized by robust and reproducible effects on DNA methylation [6, 7, 42, 43]&#8211;is also influenced by additive genetic factors. Using the extended E-Risk dataset including singletons (i.e. individuals whose co-twin did not contribute to our DNA methylation dataset), we performed an EWAS of tobacco smoking, identifying 97 differentially methylated positions (DMPs) (P < 1x10-7) (S4 Table) that are highly consistent with findings from previous studies of smoking in adults [44] (S24 Fig). We next examined the extent to which DNA methylation at these sites was influenced by genetic and environmental factors. We identified a strong genetic component to levels of DNA methylation at smoking-associated DMPs; overall there were significantly higher contributions of additive genetic influences (mean A = 37.7% (SD = 22.2%); Mann-Whitney P = 3.20x10-12) as well as shared environmental influences (mean C = 23.5% (SD = 16.0%); Mann-Whitney P = 0.00419) across smoking-associated DMPs compared to all &#8220;variable&#8221; DNA methylation sites, with a significantly smaller contribution of unique environmental influences (mean E = 38.9% (SD = 17.4%); Mann-Whitney P = 5.47x10-16) (Fig 6). We next attempted to control for the fact that smoking behavior (and therefore the &#8220;exposure&#8221; itself) is a heritable trait [45, 46]; by only considering 18-year-old twin pairs where both members have never smoked it can be assumed that the influence of tobacco exposure on DNA methylation is negligible and any observed heritability at these sites cannot result from smoking. For 95 of 97 smoking-associated DMPs, the correlation of DNA methylation in MZ concordant non-smokers (N = 315 twin-pairs) was greater than in DZ concordant non-smokers (N = 187 twin pairs) (Fig 6), representing a significant enrichment (P = 6.00x10-26). S25 Fig highlights two DMPs at which DNA methylation was strongly associated with smoking status (cg05575921: P = 1.73x10-80; cg26703534: P = 1.39x10-90) but also was notably more correlated in MZ twin pairs (cg05575921: r = 0.845; cg26703534 r = 0.658) than DZ twin pairs (cg05575921: r = 0.579; cg26703534: r = 0.444). These data are important because they provide evidence that smoking effects are not necessarily independent of smokers&#8217; genetic background, and that it is important to control for genetic background when testing for effects of tobacco on health. We also explored the genetic and environmental contributions to variation in DNA methylation at DMPs robustly associated with BMI[47], again observing that these had significantly higher additive genetic influences (mean A = 31.4% (SD = 19.4%); Mann-Whitney P = 1.83x10-11) and shared environmental influences (mean C = 23.4% (SD = 15.4%)); Mann-Whitney P = 2.16x10-13) compared to all &#8220;variable&#8221; DNA methylation sites (S26 Fig; S5 Table). These data highlight how DNA methylation at sites robustly associated with extrinsic factors can also be under strong genetic control, highlighting the need to control for genetic background in future EWAS analyses of exposure-associated DNA methylation differences.\nDiscussion\nWe quantified genome-wide patterns of DNA methylation in whole blood in 18-year-old young adults using samples collected from a large representative birth cohort of MZ and same-sex DZ twin pairs. We show that site-specific levels of DNA methylation are more strongly correlated between MZ twins than DZ twins, especially at sites with variable and intermediate levels of DNA methylation. Using structural equation models, we calculated the proportion of variance in DNA methylation explained by additive genetic effects, shared environmental effects and unshared (or unique) environmental effects, finding that, on average, the largest contribution to variation in DNA methylation can be attributed to unique environmental influences. Although the average contribution of additive genetic influences on DNA methylation was found to be relatively lower, it is variable and notably elevated at DNAm sites that are highly variable and have intermediate levels of DNAm. Interestingly, sites at which variable DNA methylation is strongly influenced by additive genetic factors are significantly enriched for blood mQTL effects, and also for sites at which inter-individual variation is correlated across tissues. Finally, we show that DNA methylation at sites robustly associated with exposures such as tobacco smoking and BMI is, in fact, also influenced by additive genetic effects, implying that environmental epigenetics research should routinely control for genetic background in future analyses. Estimates of the contribution of genetic and environmental influences to DNA methylation at all sites profiled in this study are available as a resource for the research community (http://www.epigenomicslab.com/online-data-resources).Unlike previous studies that have used twins to explore the genetic and environmental architecture of DNA methylation [19, 21, 23], we focused solely on same-sex twins who were all the same chronological age, enabling us to negate the effects of age and DZ twin sex-discordance on variable DNA methylation. Despite these strengths, however, our study has a number of important limitations that should be considered. First, because our analyses focused solely on a cross-section of young adults we cannot say anything about how genetic and environmental influences on DNA methylation change over time. Of note, our average estimate of additive genetic influences on DNA methylation is slightly below that observed in previous studies of older and more variably-aged twin-pairs [19, 23]. Second, our study cohort comprised individuals of European descent, like most other studies into the causes of variable DNA methylation. We know, however, that there are important racial and socioeconomic inequalities in pathogenic exposures and it is crucial that future work explores the contribution of genetic and environmental contributions to epigenetic variation in non-Caucasian populations. Third, although the Illumina 450K array quantifies DNA methylation at sites annotated to the majority of genes, the actual proportion of sites across the genome interrogated by this technology is relatively low, with a predominant focus on CpG-rich promoter regions. It will be important for future studies to explore factors influencing levels of DNA methylation across regions not well-covered by the Illumina 450K array, especially given our finding that genetic and environmental influences on DNA methylation are not evenly distributed across genic regions. Of note, most of the content (> 90%) of the Illumina 450K array is present on the new Illumina EPIC array [48] and the results presented here are therefore applicable to future studies using this technology. Fourth, our study only assessed a single tissue&#8211;whole blood&#8211;which itself is comprised of a heterogeneous mix of different cell-types. Although blood cell-type proportions can be accurately derived from whole blood DNA methylation data, it is likely that the contribution of genetic and environmental factors to methylomic variation differs across different cell-types. Future work should extend these analyses to quantify DNA methylation in purified blood cell-types and cell isolated from other tissues from MZ and DZ twins to explore the extent to which our findings are generalizable across tissues and cell-types. Of note, DNA methylation sites at which inter-individual variation is correlated across tissues were characterized by higher heritability, suggesting that genetic effects on DNA methylation may be relatively conserved across tissues and cell types.Although the largest contributor to inter-individual variation in DNA methylation across all tested sites was found to be non-shared environmental factors, which also captures measurement error, our findings highlight the importance of genetic influences on DNA methylation. Genetic influences appear to be especially important in mediating levels of DNA methylation at highly variable DNA methylation sites and those that are characterized by high levels of covariation across tissues suggesting that concerns relating to tissue-specific effects may be less relevant for genetic studies of DNA methylation. As expected, sites at which variable DNA methylation is strongly influenced by additive genetic factors are significantly enriched for known mQTL effects. Our results could be potentially used to improve the power of mQTL studies by providing a refined list of &#8216;heritable&#8217; DNA methylation sites, thereby reducing the multiple testing burden and sample sizes needed to identify significant mQTL associations. The mean estimate of shared environmental effects on DNAm across the genome was higher than previously reported [21] and comparable to the magnitude of influence of additive genetic factors. Given the young and comparable ages of the participants in the E-Risk cohort (all ~ 18 years old) it is plausible that a higher proportion of environmental influences are shared between the twins compared to the variably-aged and older twin pairs profiled in other studies.To conclude, we have characterized the genetic and environmental architecture of methylomic variation in a large sample of young adult MZ and DZ twins. We show that both heritable and non-genetic factors influence DNA methylation in a site-specific manner, with the contribution of genetic variation being highest at the most variable DNA methylation sites. Social-science and health researchers in search of evidence for environmental effects on the genome should not assume that &#8220;epigenetic&#8221; equates to &#8220;environmental&#8221;. Importantly, DNA methylation at sites robustly associated with extrinsic factors such as smoking and BMI can also be under strong genetic control. Our online database provides estimates of the extent to which variable DNA methylation across all sites profiled in this study are under genetic influence. Although this resource is limited by some of the features of this study&#8211;i.e. it focuses on individuals of European descent, a single age-group, and sites on the Illumina 450K array&#8211;it provides a useful framework for interpreting the results of epigenetic epidemiological studies undertaken in whole blood.\nMaterials and methods\n\nEthics statement\nThe study was approved by the NRES Committee London&#8212;Camberwell St Giles Ethics Committee, and The Joint South London and Maudsley and the Institute of Psychiatry Research Ethics Committee approved each phase of the E-Risk study (reference number: 1997/122). Parents gave written informed consent and twins gave oral assent between 5&#8211;12 years and then written informed consent at age 18.\nSamples\nParticipants were members of the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study, which tracks the development of a 1994&#8211;95 birth cohort of 2,232 British children[22]. Briefly, the E-Risk sample was constructed in 1999&#8211;2000, when 1,116 families (93% of those eligible) with same-sex 5-year-old twins participated in home-visit assessments. This sample comprised 56% monozygotic (MZ) and 44% dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs; sex was evenly distributed within zygosity (49% male). The study sample represents the full range of socioeconomic conditions in Great Britain, as reflected in the families&#8217; distribution on a neighborhood-level socioeconomic index (ACORN [A Classification of Residential Neighbourhoods], developed by CACI Inc. for commercial use)[49]: 25.6% of E-Risk families live in &#8220;wealthy achiever&#8221; neighborhoods compared to 25.3% nationwide; 5.3% vs. 11.6% live in &#8220;urban prosperity&#8221; neighborhoods; 29.6% vs. 26.9% in &#8220;comfortably off&#8221; neighborhoods; 13.4% vs. 13.9% in &#8220;moderate means&#8221; neighborhoods; and 26.1% vs. 20.7% in &#8220;hard-pressed&#8221; neighborhoods. E-Risk underrepresents &#8220;urban prosperity&#8221; neighborhoods because such households are often childless.Home visits were conducted when participants were aged 5, 7, 10, 12 and most recently, 18 years (93% participation). Our epigenetic study used DNA from a single tissue: whole blood. At age 18, whole blood was collected in 10mL K2EDTA tubes from 1,700 participants and DNA extracted from the buffy coat. (Study members who did not provide blood provided buccal swabs, but these were not included in our methylation analysis to avoid tissue-source confounds). There were no differences between participants who did versus did not participate and who did versus did not provide blood in terms of their socioeconomic background, IQ, mental health, or victimization experiences [50].\nGenome-wide quantification of DNA methylation\nWe assayed 1669 blood samples (out of 1700); 31 samples were not useable (e.g., due to low DNA concentration). ~500ng of DNA from each sample (diluted to a standard concentration of 25ng/&#956;L) was treated with sodium bisulfite using the EZ-96 DNA Methylation kit (Zymo Research, CA, USA). DNA methylation was quantified using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (&#8220;Illumina 450K array&#8221;) run on an Illumina iScan System (Illumina, CA, USA). Twin pairs were randomly assigned to bisulfite-conversion plates and Illumina 450K arrays, with siblings processed in adjacent positions to minimize batch effects. Data were imported using the methylumIDAT function in methylumi[51] and subjected to quality control analyses, checking for sex mismatches, genotype data that did not concur with those typed on Illumina OmniExpress24v1.2 arrays, and excluding low intensity samples (details in [50]). In total, samples from 1658 participants passed our QC pipeline. Data were processed with the pfilter function from the wateRmelon package[52] excluding 0 samples with >1% of sites with a detection p value >0.05, 567 sites with beadcount 5% MAF) SNPs within 10 bp of the single base extension and probes with sequences previously identified as potentially hybridizing to multiple genomic loci were excluded[53, 54], resulting in a final dataset of 430,802 probes. Zygosity of twin pairs in the E-Risk cohort was confirmed in two ways. First, signal intensities at the 65 SNP probes on the Illumina 450K array were used to confirm that MZ twins were genetically identical. Second, SNP array genotype data for these samples was used to confirm that MZ twins shared 100% of their genetic variation (PI_HAT = 1) and DZ twins shared ~ 50% of their genetic variation (PI_HAT ~ 0.5). The results from these two stages were then cross-validated for final confirmation.\nStructural equation modelling to estimate the contribution heritable and environmental influences on DNA methylation\nBiometrical modelling was applied to every probe passing QC on the Illumina 450K array. Specifically, an ACE model was fitted to calculate the proportion of variance in DNA methylation explained by additive genetic (A), shared environmental (C) and unshared or unique environmental (E) factors, the latter which also includes measurement error. The assumptions behind this model are that additive genetic factors are perfectly correlated between MZ twins (i.e. genetic correlation = 1) but are only 50% correlated between DZ twins (i.e. genetic correlation = 0.5) and that shared non-heritable influences are equally similar between MZ and DZ twin pairs. The model was fitted using structural equation modelling implemented with functions from the OpenMx R package [55, 56]. For DNA methylation sites located on the autosomes this model was fitted using all twin pairs; for sites located on the X chromosome, the analysis was performed separately for males and females. Given the sparse coverage on the Y chromosome, Y-linked sites were dropped from analysis. The same model was used to calculate A,C and E estimates for the predicted age and cell composition variables generated with the Epigenetic Clock software[32].\nProbe annotation of sites in the 450K array\nThe location of DNA methylation sites within genic features (5&#8217;UTR, 3&#8217;UTR, 1st Exon, gene body, within 200 or 1500bp of the transcription start site [TSS] and CpG island categories [CpG Island, shelf, shore]) were taken from the annotation files provided by Illumina (ftp://ussd-ftp.illumina.com/downloads/ProductFiles/HumanMethylation450/HumanMethylation450_15017482_v1-2.csv).\nDNA methylation quantitative trait loci\nDNA methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTL) were taken from a previously published study based on whole blood profiles from 639 adult samples [29]. After testing all DNA methylation sites against all genetic variants, 8,960,441 mQTL were identified using a p value threshold of 1x10-10. From this set of mQTL, 98,239/389,246 (25.2%) of DNA methylation sites overlapping with the heritability analysis had an mQTL.\nDNA methylation sites associated with tobacco smoking\nTo identify DNA methylation sites associated with tobacco smoking, a linear regression model was fitted across the extended E-Risk sample including singletons (n = 1,658). Current smokers (N = 392) were compared against former (N = 42) and never smokers (N = 1,223) whilst controlling for sex, batch, and 7 estimated variables relating to cellular heterogeneity generated with either the Houseman algorithm [33, 34] or Horvath Epigenetic clock [32]. To control for the fact that many members of the sample are related robust standard errors were calculated with the R packages plm [57] and sandwich [58] and used to generate p-values. 97 DNA methylation sites were associated with current smoking status at an experiment-wide p-value threshold of 1x10-7. It should be noted that the exact number of genome-wide significant associations for tobacco smoking differs slightly from that reported in [50] due to differences in methods used to account for related samples and due to filtering DNA methylation sites based on their variability.\nDNA methylation sites associated with BMI\nDNA methylation sites associated with BMI were identified from the supplementary material published as part of the EWAS performed by Wahl et al [47]. Taking their 187 replicated, sentinel associations, 176 of these were present in our set of variable DNA methylation sites and therefore were included for comparison with our estimates of heritability.\nSupporting information\n", "pmid": "30091980", "title": "Characterizing genetic and environmental influences on variable DNA methylation using monozygotic and dizygotic twins", "journal_title": "PLoS Genetics", "authors": "Eilis Hannon;Olivia Knox;Karen Sugden;Joe Burrage;Chloe C.

Thus, Hb levels may provide an additional and cost-effective tool to discriminate between STS patients that are at high risk of mortality.", "body": "Introduction\nSoft tissue sarcomas (STSs) are a relatively rare and heterogenous group of malignancies. They include a diverse group of non-epithelial extraskeletal tumors that show the histological differentiation of muscle, fat, nerves, and fibrous tissue. Their variable cellular appearance results in categorization of over 100 histologic sarcoma subtypes that differ in biology and behavior and make diagnosis and treatment challenging for clinicians [1]. Accordingly, the overall 5-year survival rate is only 50%, and especially STS patients that present with high grade tumors are at significant risk of disease recurrence [2]. The most important prognostic factors for local recurrence and distant metastasis are tumor size, tumor grade, histologic subtype, tumor depth and site and age at diagnosis [3]. However, predicting the outcome of STS patients remains sub-optimal and lacks predictive accuracy. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify additional prognostic markers. Blood-based biomarkers seem to be especially attractive for prognosis purposes, which might help clinicians to adopt preventive and therapeutic strategies for high risk patients [4]&#8211;[6].Anemia is the most common hematologic abnormality in cancer patients. Although anemia incidence varies with types of malignancies and disease stage, it has been assumed that over 40% of all cancer patients are anemic at the time of diagnosis, a rate that increases up to 80% in patients with advanced disease [7]. The origin of cancer-related anemia is often multifactorial. It is a consequence of dysfunction of iron metabolism, inadequate production of erythropoietin (Epo) and inadequate response of the bone marrow to endogenous Epo, suppressed hematopoiesis through bone marrow infiltration, increased destruction of red blood cells, reduced number of erythroid progenitor cells in the bone marrow and production of inflammatory cytokines [8]&#8211;[10]. As the clinical symptoms of anemia start slowly, hemoglobin (Hb) level represents the most important predictor in guiding anemia evaluation and treatment. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the cut-off levels for anemia were defined as Hb levels <13 g/dl in males and Hb levels <12 g/dl in females [11]. Recent studies indicate that a low Hb level is an unfavorable prognostic factor in diverse cancer types, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), ovarian carcinoma and pancreatic cancer [12]&#8211;[14]. To the best of our knowledge, only one similar sized study in surgical treated STS patients reported about a poor prognostic value of Hb levels [15]. Therefore, the present study was conducted to externally validate the prognostic significance of pre-operative Hb levels on cancer-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS) in a large cohort of STS patients who underwent curative surgery.\nMaterials and Methods\n\nSubjects\nThree hundred and sixty seven patients with histologically confirmed STS who have been operated between March 1998 and August 2013 at the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Medical University of Graz, were retrospectively analyzed. Patients without available laboratory parameters or histological proven diagnosis were not included in this study. All patients were of Caucasians ancestry. The date of last follow-up documentation was the 1st July, 2014. All patients were included in the follow-up program of the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery and the Division of Clinical Oncology, Medical University of Graz, providing follow-up examinations in regular intervals (3 month intervals in years 1&#8211;3, 6 months intervals in years 4&#8211;5, and 12 month intervals in years 6&#8211;15 after diagnosis). The laboratory data, including pre-operative Hb, was obtained by pre-operative determination one to three days before surgery was performed. Follow-up investigations included clinical check-up and radiological analyses (computed tomography alternating with X-ray of the chest, local magnetic resonance imaging, and abdominal ultrasound). Clinico-pathological data including histopathological diagnosis and tumor grade were retrospectively obtained from the patients history. For the present study, all histological specimens were centrally reviewed by an independent experienced soft tissue pathologist (B. LA). All sarcomas were diagnosed according to the current WHO classification of soft tissue and bone tumors [1]. Tumors were graded according to the French Federation of Cancer Centres Sarcoma Group (FNCLCC) grading system if possible or tumor grade was defined by tumor entity [16]. Cases formerly classified as malignant fibrous histiocytomas have been re-classified according to the current diagnostic criteria [1], [17]. This study has been approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the Medical University of Graz. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.\nStatistical analysis\nThe primary endpoint of this study was CSS, which was calculated from the date of diagnosis to the date of cancer-related death. Secondary endpoint included OS which was defined as time between diagnosis and death of any cause. For anemia, the pre-published and most commonly used cut-off value of Hb level <13 g/dl in males and Hb level <12 g/dl in females was applied [12], [15]. The association between the Hb level and clinico-pathological parameters was evaluated by non-parametric tests (Mann-Whitney U and chi square test). Patients&#8217; clinical endpoints were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared by the log rank test. Backward stepwise multivariate Cox proportion analysis was performed to determine the influence of age, gender, tumor size, grade and depth and Hb levels on CSS and OS. Hazard ratios (HRs) estimated from the Cox analysis were reported as relative risks with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). All statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 20.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) or R program. A two-sided p<0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nResults\nOne hundred and eighty three male patients and 184 female patients with STS were included in the study. The median follow-up time was 37 months (interquartile range 14 to 88 months). Forty seven patients were lost to follow-up. The 367 patients were histologically classified as follows: 101 myxofibrosarcomas, 94 liposarcomas, 43 leiomyosarcomas, 29 synovial sarcoma, 13 malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours (MPNSTs) and 87 other histological subtypes. The primary tumour site was localized at the upper extremities (n&#8202;=&#8202;86), lower extremities (n&#8202;=&#8202;219), thorax/trunk (n&#8202;=&#8202;52), retroperitoneal/intraabdominal (n&#8202;=&#8202;6) and head/neck (n&#8202;=&#8202;4). The tumor depth was defined superficial in 120 patients and deep in 247 patients. All STS patients underwent surgery, and 43 (11.7%) were administered adjuvant chemotherapy. Two hundred twenty-five (61.3%) of the 367 sarcoma patients received adjuvant radiation therapy for the primary tumour site. The resection margins were determined as wide in 331 and marginal in 36 STS patients. Of the 367 STS patients, 70 (19.1%) developed metastatic disease, of which 62 (16.9%) died due to their advanced disease state. Thirty three patients (9%) presented with local recurrence. Overall 136 (37.1%) patients died of any cause by their most recent follow-up.We validated the pre-published values of Hb level <13 g/dl in males and Hb level <12 g/dl in females as the cut-offs for the continuous Hb. Consequently, we separated the STS patients into two groups according to low Hb (<13 g/dl in males and <12 g/dl in females) levels or high Hb (&#8805;13 g/dl in males and &#8805;12 g/dl in females) levels and tested the association between pre-operative Hb levels and other clinico-pathological factors. We found a statistically significant association between a low Hb level and older age, higher tumor grade, deep tumor location and larger tumor size (p<0.05), whereas no correlation with gender, tumor site and histologic subtype could be demonstrated (Table 1).Analyzing the Hb levels into more detail, among the 367 STS patients, cancer-related death was diagnosed in 18 of 70 (25.7%) patients with low Hb levels and in 40 of 297 (13.5%) patients with high Hb levels (p<0.05). Overall deaths occurred in 44 (62.9%) patients with low Hb levels and in 82 (27.6%) patients with high Hb levels, respectively (p<0.05). Figures 1 and 2 show the Kaplan-Meier curves for CSS and OS and reveal that a low Hb level is a significant factor for decreased CSS and OS in STS patients (p<0.001 for CSS and OS, log-rank test).To investigate whether serum Hb levels and other clinical-pathological factors are associated with clinical outcome of STS patients, univariate and multivariate Cox proportional models for CSS and OS were calculated. Univariate analysis identified a high tumor grade (G1+G2 versus G3, p&#8202;=&#8202;0.002) and a low Hb level (<13 g/dl in males and <12 g/dl in females versus &#8805;13 g/dl in males and &#8805;12 g/dl in females, p<0.001) as poor prognostic factors for CSS in our study cohort (Table 2). For OS, we found a significant association between an older age (<60 versus &#8805;60, p&#8202;=&#8202;0.002), a high tumor grade (G1+G2 versus G3, p<0.001) and a low Hb level (<13 g/dl in males and <12 g/dl in females versus &#8805;13 g/dl in males and &#8805;12 g/dl in females, p<0.001) and poor clinical outcome (Table 3). In the multivariate analysis that included age, gender, tumor grade, tumor depth, tumor size and the Hb level, we determined tumor grade and Hb level as independent prognostic factors for CSS (HR&#8202;=&#8202;2.34, 95% CI&#8202;=&#8202;1.28&#8211;4.30, p&#8202;=&#8202;0.006; HR&#8202;=&#8202;0.46, 95% CI&#8202;=&#8202;0.25&#8211;0.85, p&#8202;=&#8202;0.012; Table 2) and age, tumor grade and Hb level for OS (HR&#8202;=&#8202;1.77, 95% CI&#8202;=&#8202;1.10&#8211;2.85, p&#8202;=&#8202;0.019; HR&#8202;=&#8202;2.55, 95% CI&#8202;=&#8202;1.67&#8211;3.89, p<0.001; HR&#8202;=&#8202;0.34, 95% CI&#8202;=&#8202;0.23&#8211;0.51, p<0.001; Table 3).Overall, in liposarcoma patients the incidence of anaemia was 12.8% (12 out of 94 patients) compared to 19% in the whole STS cohort. We analysed the incidence of anemia in these patients and found that the frequency of anaemia was significantly higher in patients with grade 2 (15%) or 3 (30.4%) liposarcomas compared to grade 1 (3.8%) liposarcoma patients (p &#8202;=&#8202;0.006).\nDiscussion\nIn the present study, we found an independently significant association between low pre-operative Hb levels and poor clinical outcome in STS patients.Pre-treatment anemia, indicated by low Hb levels, was reported to negatively influence clinical outcome in various types of cancer. Aoe et al reported a reduced median survival time (MST) in a large cohort of 611 NSCLC patients with anemia, defined as a Hb level <13 g/dl in males and <12 g/dl in females, at first presentation [12]. In pancreatic cancer, pre-operative Hb levels <12 g/dl were significantly associated with poor survival [13]. Another study, that included 206 patients with ovarian carcinoma, showed a decreased OS in patients with low Hb levels [14]. In STS, Nakamura et al demonstrated in 376 patients that low Hb levels (Hb levels <13 g/dl in men and <12 g/dl in women) correlated with established poor prognostic factors, including larger tumor size, higher tumor grade and older age. Furthermore, STS patients with anemia showed an independent association with reduced disease-specific survival (DSS) and event-free survival (EFS) [15]. In line with these findings, in the present study, low Hb levels were found predominantly in STS patients presenting with well-known factors associated with worse prognosis, such as high tumor grade, deep tumor location, large tumor size and older age. Similarly, we demonstrated that low Hb levels were significantly associated with decreased CSS in uni- and multivariate analysis. Additionally, an independent association between low Hb level and OS was observed in our study. These results might be explained by the fact that, on the one hand, in patients with malignancies, anemia might result from the extent of cancer-burden, and on the other hand may also be caused by co-morbidities that result in decreased survival, such as coagulation disorders, hemolysis, renal insufficiency, bleeding, or nutritional deficiencies [18]&#8211;[20]. Interestingly, in a subgroup analysis, Nakamura et al observed a higher incidence of anemia in patients with malignant fibrous histiocytomas (MFHs) and a low incidence of anemia in liposarcoma patients and attributed this to the fact that most of the liposarcoma patients presented with grade 1 liposarcomas. They also analyzed the relationship between anaemia, survival, and event separately for patients with malignant fibrous histiocytomas (MFHs) and liposarcomas and found that a low Hb level was a significant adverse prognostic factor for EFS in MFHs and liposarcomas. Moreover, patients with MFHs and anemia showed a significantly poorer DSS than those without anemia, whereas in liposarcomas, the rates of DSS did not significantly differ between those with and without anaemia [15]. To clarify these findings, in the present study, we analyzed the incidence of anemia in liposarcoma patients separately with respect to the grade and found that the frequency of anemia was higher in patients with grade 2 or 3 liposarcomas compared to grade 1 liposarcomas.Based on recent data from experimental and clinical studies, there is increasing evidence that low Hb levels are associated with a poor tumor oxygenation and that up to 50&#8211;60% of locally advanced solid tumors may exhibit hypoxic tissue areas [21]. Hypoxia in solid tumors has been associated with malignant progression in terms of recurrence, loco-regional spread and distant metastasis, mediated by proteomic and genomic changes activating angiogenesis, anaerobic metabolism and other processes that enable tumor cells to survive or escape their oxygen-deficient environment, thus promoting the selection and expansion of more aggressive tumor clones [22]. Multivariate analyses have shown that hypoxia is a powerful prognostic factor in various cancer types, including STS. Brizel et al reported a significantly lower 18-month actuarial disease-free survival (DFS) rate in STS patients with tumor median oxygen pressure (pO2) values of 10 mmHg (35% versus 70%, p&#8202;=&#8202;0.01). Additionally, they demonstrated that the median pO2 for metastasized tumors was lower than for non-metastasized tumors [23]. In another study that investigated the relationship between tumor oxygenation and cell proliferation in STS, a significant association between the median pO2 and tumor cell potential doubling time was found, reporting the fastest proliferating tumor cells in the poorest oxygenated tumors [24]. Thus, we hypothesize that one reason for the poor clinical outcome in STS patients with low Hb levels in the present study might be due to tumor hypoxia. On the other hand, some cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), have been demonstrated to induce anemia [25], [26]. It has been shown that IL-6 induces the liver to produce hepcidin. Hepcidin decreases iron absorption from the bowel and the gut and blocks iron utilization in the bone marrow, so that it is not available for erythropoiesis, resulting in cancer-related anemia [25]. Rutkowski et al reported that increased serum levels of IL-6 were found in the majority of STS patients included in their study [27].In conclusion, the findings in our study suggest that low pre-operative Hb levels are significantly associated with decreased CSS and OS in STS patients after curative surgery. In context with the previously published study by Nakamura et al., we independently confirmed (or externally validated) their findings [15]. As both studies used a middle European cohort of Caucasian ancestry, evidence is supported that hemoglobin levels in STS patients are a general prognostic factor in other central European countries or Caucasians in the North American hemisphere. We identified anemia as an additional prognostic factor that might help to allow a more accurate strategy for stratifying patients with STS for risk of tumor-related and unrelated death. Markers like the haemoglobin can provide improvements in individual therapy modalities and follow-up schedules [4], [5]. In STS patients, administration of adjuvant chemotherapy is controversially discussed. Consequently, easily accessible, cheap and robust prognostic factors, such as Hb levels, might be helpful to allow treatment options to be tailored to the individual risk situation. With accurate prediction, patients at low risk for disease recurrence can be spared the toxicity of further treatment, whereas patients at high risk might be considered as candidates for additional adjuvant systemic therapy, novel experimental or more aggressive treatment approaches or more stringent follow-up schedules. As with all retrospective studies, our cohort is not without limitations. There have been several different surgeons involved over the years in the treatment of patients, and some other factors could also led to a selection bias, especially as we only included patients that were physically appropriate for a surgical procedure. In addition, we had no information about the influence of blood transfusions or administration of erythropoiesis stimulating agents on prognosis. Although the present investigations are limited due to their retrospective study design and the mixture of various histologic subtypes of STS, our data indicates that Hb levels, which are frequently measured in the routinely tested complete blood count panel, may represent a potentially important variable that can be included with other clinico-pathological parameters and laboratory findings to create new cancer prognosis assessment models.", "pmid": "25207808", "title": "Pre-Treatment Anemia Is a Poor Prognostic Factor in Soft Tissue Sarcoma Patients", "journal_title": "PLoS ONE", "authors": "Joanna Szkandera;Armin Gerger;Bernadette Liegl-Atzwanger;Michael Stotz;Hellmut Samonigg;Ferdinand Ploner;Tatjana Stojakovic;Andreas Leithner;Martin Pichler", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0107297", "score": "0.023470815"}, {"keywords": "", "abstract": "Seed formation is a pivotal process in plant reproduction and dispersal. It begins with megagametophyte development in the ovule, followed by fertilization and subsequently coordinated development of embryo, endosperm, and maternal seed coat. Two closely related MADS-box genes, SHATTERPROOF 1 and 2 (SHP1 and SHP2) are involved in specifying ovule integument identity in Arabidopsis thaliana. The MADS box gene ARABIDOPSIS BSISTER (ABS or TT16) is required, together with SEEDSTICK (STK) for the formation of endothelium, part of the seed coat and innermost tissue layer formed by the maternal plant. Little is known about the genetic interaction of SHP1 and SHP2 with ABS and the coordination of endosperm and seed coat development. In this work, mutant and expression analysis shed light on this aspect of concerted development. Triple tt16 shp1 shp2 mutants produce malformed seedlings, seed coat formation defects, fewer seeds, and mucilage reduction. While shp1 shp2 mutants fail to coordinate the timely development of ovules, tt16 mutants show less peripheral endosperm after fertilization. Failure in coordinated division of the innermost integument layer in early ovule stages leads to inner seed coat defects in tt16 and tt16 shp1 shp2 triple mutant seeds. An antagonistic action of ABS and SHP1/SHP2 is observed in inner seed coat layer formation. Expression analysis also indicates that ABS represses SHP1, SHP2, and FRUITFUL expression. Our work shows that the evolutionary conserved Bsister genes are required not only for endothelium but also for endosperm development and genetically interact with SHP1 and SHP2 in a partially antagonistic manner.", "body": "Introduction\nFor seed setting, most angiosperms go through a double fertilization process, whereby two sperm cells released from a pollen tube fuse with the egg cell and the central cell within the female gametophyte. These later develop into a diploid embryo and the triploid endosperm constituting the seed which is surrounded by the seed coat originating from the maternal integuments of the ovule [1, 2, 3].The endosperm is an essential part of the seed since it provides nutrients to the developing embryo during seed development [4]. In addition, endosperm and its associated aleurone layers are important for germination and subsequent seedling development [5, 6]. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the development of endosperm follows the nuclear type pattern whereby a repeated free nuclear division, without cytokinesis, is followed by a cellularization event [3]. Several studies indicated that proper endosperm development, nuclear division and cellularization are essential for the success of viable seed setting [7]. One of the factors that influence embryo and endosperm development is the maternal tissue, the integuments, whose communication with the endosperm is essential for seed development [8, 9, 10, 11]. Several genes, including MADS-box transcription factor encoding genes, have been implicated in the ovule integument and seed endosperm development [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 7, 18].The MADS-box gene family is one of the most thoroughly investigated gene families. Members of this gene family encode proteins that are mainly characterized by their highly conserved DNA-binding domain of 58 amino acids known as the MADS-domain that specifically binds to CC(A/T)6GG motifs found in the regulatory regions of their target genes [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24].The Bsister MADS box gene clade was named based on their close phylogenetic relationship to the B-class genes and on the fact that members of this clade are mainly expressed in female rather than in male reproductive organs [25]. Members of the Bsister gene clade are present in all angiosperms and gymnosperms investigated so far and they are reported to have a highly conserved ovular expression [25, 26].The ARABIDOPSIS BSISTER gene (ABS) was the first Bsister gene to be functionally characterized and the mutant allele tt16-1 (transparent testa 16&#8211;1) defective in ABS function has been analyzed most extensively [27, 28]. ABS expression is restricted to the ovule, in the cells of which the protein is localized in the nucleus [29, 18]. tt16-1 ovules show thinner inner integument cell layers and develop into a straw-colored seed, except in their chalaza-micropyle area, due to the inactivation of BANYULS (BAN), a key regulator of proanthocyanidin (PA) biosynthesis [27, 28].ABS orthologs (BnTT161-4) in Brassica napus (rapeseed canola) also regulate agronomically important traits such as seed oil content and fatty acid composition. B. napus ABS ortholog RNAi lines have seeds with flattened and wrinkled structure containing a defective embryo or completely lacking an embryo and altered fatty acid composition [30, 31]. Similar to eudicots, monocot Bsister genes are also reported to be involved in seed development [32, 33]. OsMADS29, one of the three Bsister homologs in rice (Oryza sativa), regulates the expression of genes that are essential for initiation of programmed cell death (PCD) in the nucellar region of developing seeds. Expressed mainly in the ovule, down-regulation of OsMADS29 resulted in shrunken seeds with poor grain-filling rate [32, 33]. Another OsMADS29 loss-of-function mutant allele, fst (female sterile) shows a phenotype including complete female sterility due to an absence of embryo and endosperm development [34].Protein interaction analyses indicated that ABS forms heterodimers and tetramers with several MADS proteins, including the D-class floral homeotic proteins: SEEDSTICK (STK), SHATTERPROOF 1 and 2 (SHP1, SHP2) mediated by SEPALLATA 3 (SEP3) [35]. ABS and STK function redundantly to regulate the ovule inner integument formation; abs stk lacks the entire inner integument layer and, subsequently, the endothelium, resulting in extremely poor seed setting [18].SHP1 and SHP2 are two closely related and highly redundant MADS-box genes involved in several aspects of reproductive development. They are best known for their promotion of lignification in the dehiscence zone, hence causing pod shattering at maturity. While single shp mutant fruits resemble those of the wild type, shp1 shp2 double mutant fruits fail to dehisce, and plants that over-express the two genes show premature fruit opening at the valve margins [36]. Furthermore, SHP1 and SHP2 are required for ovule identity, together with STK and the class C floral homeotic gene AGAMOUS (AG). However, it remains unknown if the SHP1 and SHP2 carry non-redundant functions in seed development. Using SEP3 as a bridging protein, all combinations of AG, STK, and SHP1 or SHP2 form ternary complexes and promote ovule identity, most likely via a protein complex involving SHP1 and/or SHP2, STK, and SEP3 [37, 14]Here, we report additional functions for ABS and SHP1/SHP2 in ovule development, integument formation, endosperm development, and seed coat differentiation, and we further elucidate the genetic interactions between gynoecium and seed expressed MADS-box genes. Throughout the manuscript, we refer to the gene name ABS [3] whereas the name tt16 refers to the knock-out mutant of the ABS gene [27].\nResults\n\nNone\nPreviously, it was shown that the ABS function in endothelium development is masked by genetic redundancy with STK [18]. We produced the triple mutant tt16-1 shp1-1 shp2-1 (called tt16 shp1 shp2 below) to assess if ABS also genetically interacts with other MADS-box genes, such as SHP1 and SHP2 which share their domain of expression at least in part with ABS [38, 39].First we observed the viability of the seedlings for the wild type Ws-4 (as tt16-1 is an INRA-Versaille line mutant and Ws-4 is the parental line for this mutant population) and Col-0 (as the shp1 shp2 mutant is in Col-0) and mutant seeds (tt16, shp1 shp2, and tt16 shp1 shp2 obtained by crossing) which detached from the fruit since the seeds were sieved after harvesting. While the cotyledon greening assay on soil was similar for the genotypes tested (Fig 1A), serious developmental defects were observed in the tt16 shp1 shp2 triple mutant seedlings, when compared to all other genotypes (Fig 1B).We then observed the seed morphology of the mutants and two wild type accessions (Fig 1C&#8211;1G, details are shown enlarged in S1A&#8211;S1E Fig). The wild type genotypes and the shp1 shp2 seeds were brown and not fully expanded seeds were only very rarely observed (Fig 1C, 1D and 1F). The seeds of the tt16 mutant plants were straw-colored (Fig 1E) with a darker chalaza (S1C Fig), as reported previously by Nesi et al. 2002 [27]. Seeds from the tt16 shp1 shp2 mutant showed a similar coloration (Fig 1G and S1E Fig). However, both, tt16 and the triple mutants produced many seeds that were not fully expanded and deformed suggesting that endosperm filling or embryo expansion may be impaired when ABS gene function is compromised. Interestingly, this aspect of the tt16 phenotype cannot be compensated by the simultaneous loss of SHP1 and SHP2.The first step during the germination process is rehydration, which occurs when seeds are exposed to water. Upon imbibition the outer layer of the seed coat expands and the mucilage it produces is also hydrated. Several intertwined developmental and biochemical processes are required for mucilage production. Firstly, the integuments need to differentiate in the ovule, providing the cells that later constitute the testa. The epidermal cells then produce thick secondary cell walls, synthesize and secrete pectins and provide transcription factors and enzymes for maturation and linking of the pectins to the epidermal cells by cellulose (for review see North et al., 2014 [40]). We used Ruthenium Red staining to characterize the mucilage production and adherence (Fig 1H&#8211;1L, see also S1F&#8211;S1J Fig for a close-up of the seed coat of imbibed seeds). The two wild type ecotypes Ws-4 and Col-0 showed a thick uniform layer of mucilage that adhered firmly to the seed coat (Fig 1H and 1I). Seeds of tt16 produced mucilage that expanded to the same thickness as in the wild types, but the mucilage detached easily from the seed coat and was less intensely stained. This suggests that the polysaccharide matrix is less dense and less well connected to the epidermis (Fig 1J). This result contrasts to a previous report by Dean et al. (2011) [41], who did not observe a difference in mucilage quantity between Ws and tt16 seeds. However, the growth conditions were different; the plants were grown in continuous light in the experiments by Dean et al. (2011) [41] while we grew them in long day conditions. The seeds of shp1 shp2 developed a thinner mucilage layer with an uneven distribution of pectins (Fig 1K), suggesting that mucilage is produced but does not expand properly or is not fully released from the epidermal cells. However, mucilage adherence to the epidermis did not seem to be affected (Fig 1K). The triple mutants showed only small patches of mucilage remaining on the seed, indicating additive effects of the tt16 and shp1 shp2 mutations and consequently both a reduction in production and adherence of mucilage (Fig 1L). These observations indicate that not only the endothelium layer is affected by the tt16 mutation, but also the epidermal cell layer of the seed coat. Furthermore they suggest that epidermal seed coat development may be also affected in the shp1 shp2 mutant.A morphological analysis of the seedlings was subsequently performed to describe the abnormalities that were observed in around 50% of the triple mutant seedlings (Fig 1B). Around 90% of wild type seedlings and more than 70% of tt16, and shp1 shp2 seedlings showed a root of around 8 to 9 mm in length, two fully expanded cotyledons and the first set of true leaves emerging from the shoot apical meristem (SAM) five days after stratification (Fig 1M). 50% of tt16 shp1 shp2 seedlings showed defects in development, with a lack of properly developed roots, defective cotyledon expansion and a frequent inability to develop true leaves (Fig 1N and 1P). In most cases the small roundish cotyledons are partially fused (Fig 1N&#8211;1P), and a large portion of the abnormal seedlings (~ 70%) failed to develop roots or true leaves and died within 12 days after stratification. Even if the seedlings survived and were able to produce leaves (Fig 1Q and 1R), they were smaller in size and also lagged behind the development of the wild types, tt16, and shp1 shp2 plants throughout their life.In many cases, fused organs (either failed to separate or fused together later in development) can be observed in the malformed seedlings (Fig 1O), and this may point towards a differential regulation of proteins involved in fatty acid biosynthesis in wild type and the mutants [42], more specifically in the fatty acid composition that specifies the properties of the embryo&#8217;s cuticula. However, Focks and Benning (1998) [43] reported that a severe reduction in seed oil content and a change in fatty acid composition caused by the wrinkled1 mutant do not alter plantlet growth and morphology.S1 Fig compares the fatty acid composition in the seed storage oil of the wild type and mutant genotypes. The tt16 mutant showed elevated oleic acid (C18:1) content with simultaneously decreased alpha-linolenic acid (C18:3). This supports previous results from Deng et al. (2012) [18], who described a reduction in fatty acid desaturase (FAD) gene expression in Brassica napus tt16 RNAi lines. Alterations in fatty acid desaturation may also explain the slight increase in arachidic acid (C20:0) and another unidentified fatty acid in the tt16 and tt16 shp1 shp2 mutants. Interestingly, the observed changes in oleic acid/alpha linolenic acid composition were more pronounced in the tt16 single mutant compared to tt16 shp1 shp2, consistent with the compensatory effect of the triple mutant that was observed for other seed development traits (see below).As the seedlings did not show a uniform phenotype, ABS, SHP1, and SHP2 may not be involved in establishing embryo architecture. Instead the three genes may be involved in nutrient supply to the embryo, resulting in malnourished seedlings when their function is lost. Alternatively, the malformation could be caused by mechanical stress of the embryos not being able to increase in size due to a seed cavity too small in size.\nNone\nWe and others (Fig 1; [27, 28, 18]) have shown that ABS is required for proper seed development. However, previously published work describing the function of ABS was limited to the formative divisions of the inner integument, the development of the endothelium cell layer and regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis. The data presented in Fig 1 already indicate that this may not draw the complete picture of ABS function, as we observe defects in mucilage production, seed expansion and seedling development in the tt16 shp1 shp2 mutants. These data suggest a function for ABS, SHP1, and SHP2 in these tissues. To learn which developmental defects lead to the consequences presented in Fig 1, we thoroughly analyzed seed coat, endosperm, and embryo development in tt16, shp1 shp2 and in tt16 shp1 shp2 mutant lines by observing cleared seeds of different developmental stages.Seed development is a highly complex process which starts with ovule development and fertilization, followed by coordinated embryo, endosperm, and testa formation. This long-term growth process requires a constant flow of nutrients from the carpel marginal tissue. A failure in any of these subordinate processes can result in developmental defects of the seed and embryo. To characterize details of the developmental defects in which the tt16 and tt16 shp1 shp2 mutants deviate from that of wild type seeds, we closely observed ovules/seeds in stage 16 to 17A siliques in which properly developing seeds with embryos at octant, globular or heart stages are found (Fig 2A). Ws-4 and Col-0 wild type seeds were rather similar, with less than 3% of unfertilized ovules/very young seeds observed (classified as stage 3-VI of megagametogenesis or post-fertilization stage 4-I according to the morphological criteria defined by Schneitz et al., 1995 [44]; see below) and around 77% of properly developed seeds, leaving approximately 21% of seeds that showed defects in embryo or endosperm development. In the tt16 mutant, the number of unfertilized ovules/very young seeds was increased to around 6.5%, but the number of seeds showing developmental defects in embryo or endosperm development was increased to over 50%. Conversely, 29% of the ovules in shp1 shp2 mutants remained unfertilized or arrested in a very young post-fertilization stage, but in most fertilized ovules, the development of the embryo and endosperm commenced normally and almost 67% of the seeds developed normally. In the triple mutant, the number of unfertilized ovules/very young seeds was only slightly higher than in the shp1 shp2 double mutant, ranging around 34%. Another 25% of seeds showed abnormal embryo or endosperm development, leaving only around 41% normally developed seeds.A thorough analysis of Ws-4 and Col-0 ovule and seed development is documented in S2 Fig. The typical defects observed in the two wild type ecotypes (Ws-4 and Col-0) and in the mutant lines are shown in Fig 2C&#8211;2K in comparison to a properly developing Ws-4 seed Fig 2B. The correctly developing wild type seeds exhibited intact embryos at globular stage surrounded by endosperm nuclei and the five-layered testa composed of cells in the typical pattern: the two inner cell layers included large roundish cells while the outer three layers were made of thinner, more rectangular cells (Fig 2B for Ws-4 and S2E and S3A Figs for Col-0, later stages of both wild types are shown in S2F&#8211;S2H Fig). Abnormal development of wild type seeds was mostly accompanied by the lack of an embryo, indicating early abortion of unfertilized ovules or very young seeds (Fig 2C and 2D) while unfertilized ovules/very young seeds with a normal appearance were only rarely found (Fig 2E).Developmental defects were observed in the tt16 mutant seeds. In many cases the endosperm failed to develop completely (Fig 2F) or only the peripheral endosperm was significantly reduced or missing, whereas the development of the embryo (S5 Fig) and the chalazal and micropylar endosperm seemed largely unaffected, at least until the globular stage. As seen in Fig 2F, the regularly layered cells of the seed coat often are missing, with the seed instead showing an unstructured testa with irregularly shaped cells. The small seed size may indicate premature abortion (compared with Fig 2B for a WT seed at respective developmental stage). In other tt16 seeds, the embryo continued to develop normally and some endosperm was formed (Fig 2G), most likely resulting in shriveled seeds at maturity. Unfertilized ovules/very young seeds with a normal appearance were rarely observed in the tt16 mutant siliques (S3B Fig). As observed for 0.4 to 2% of all investigated plant lines&#8217; seeds including the wild types, also the tt16 mutant embryos showed irregularities in protoderm development (S5B&#8211;S5D Fig; see also Fig 2J and S5G and S5H Fig for triple mutant embryos). Sporadically (between 0.3 and 1.5% of the seeds), conspicuously short suspensors were observed, which may cause spatial and mechanical problems during further embryo growth (Fig 2F and S5E and S5F Fig; see also S5H and S5I Fig for triple mutant embryos). Taken together, however, these results demonstrate that ABS has no prominent role in embryo development, but is involved in endosperm formation. Reduction in the number of peripheral endosperm nuclei suggests arrested endosperm nuclear divisions, but defects in the migration of endosperm nuclei can also not be ruled out.Stage 16 and 17A siliques of the shp1 shp2 mutants showed a large fraction of presumably unfertilized ovules in which the embryo sacs were not markedly curved and possessed antipodal cells besides only one (fused) central cell nucleus, indicating stage 3-VI of megagametogenesis (Fig 2H; [44]). Whether the central cell nucleus had already fused with a sperm nucleus to form the endosperm nucleus in the post-fertilization stage 4-I could not always be ruled out, but nuclear endosperm development had certainly not been initiated and stage 4-II was not reached.The tt16 shp1 shp2 triple mutant showed additive effects of the mutant phenotypes and had many unfertilized ovules/very young seeds as well as many seeds with severe developmental deficiencies (Fig 2A and 2I&#8211;2K). In contrast to the wild types, lack of the embryo was only seldom observed (Fig 2I), but the fertilized ovules regularly resulted in developing seeds with a complete lack of endosperm. Fig 2J shows such a structure, with an embryo at early globular stage that developed without surrounding endosperm in a seed that failed to expand (cf. S3A Fig for the respective wild type seed). In several cases the chalazal and micropylar endosperm was formed, but the peripheral endosperm developed to a much lower extent than in the wild types (Fig 2K, see S2F Fig for the respective wild type seed). In the milder form of the triple mutant phenotype, the seed cavity has a normal size, although the quantity of endosperm still fails to reach that of the wild type. Detailed images of endosperm content in the triple mutant seeds with embryos at early globular stage and heart stage of weaker phenotypes are shown S3C&#8211;S3E Fig showing well developed micropylar and chalazal endosperm but missing peripheral endosperm.In summary, the presented data indicate that ABS is important for endosperm development and that SHP1 and SHP2 are required for timely ovule/seed development and/or fertilization. However, in the triple mutant we observed that the number of unfertilized ovules/very young seeds remained similar to the shp1 shp2 double mutant and endosperm developmental defects were those seen in the tt16 mutant suggesting no genetic interactions of ABS and SHP1/SHP2 in these aspects of ovule and seed development.\nNone\nThe A. thaliana inner seed coat layer ii1 is the innermost maternal layer of the seed. It differentiates into the endothelium which mediates nutrient delivery to the endosperm and embryo. In the following, the term &#8220;endothelium&#8221; is reserved for the innermost cell layer (ii1) of the wild type seed coats. Because we cannot be sure that the innermost seed coat layer of the mutants develops into an endothelium, we refrain from using the term endothelium, but use the term ii1 for the innermost seed coat layer and ii1&#180; for the second innermost layer [46] in all the mutants used.Because the ii1 cells in tt16-1 plants show cell division defects, were longer, flatter and more vacuolized than in wild type, and the endothelium was missing completely in tt16-6 stk mutants [27, 28, 18], we thoroughly analyzed the growth pattern of the endothelium/ii1 layer whose periclinal divisions give rise to the neighboring ii1&#8217;. We investigated well developed seeds with globular to heart staged embryos in wild type plants of two ecotypes, Ws-4 and Col-0, and in the three mutant lines to better understand the defects observed in the tt16 mutants and to learn if SHP1 and SHP2 also have a role in inner seed coat development. Fig 3A and 3B (and S4A&#8211;S4J Fig) give a quantitative overview of the inner seed coat layer anatomy in the different plant lines, while representative examples are shown in Fig 3C&#8211;3J and S4K&#8211;S4V Fig.For a clearly laid-out documentation of the observations we divided the seed coat in the chalazal side (starting from the chalazal towards the distal end) and the micropylar side (starting from the micropylar to the distal end) (S2E Fig), although both sides originate from the curving zone at the abaxial side of the ovule (S2C and S2D Fig). The two wild type ecotypes Ws-4 and Col-0 showed almost identical layer patterns at the chalazal side of the inner seed coat. More than 82% of the seeds had a complete ii1&#180; layer reaching from the distal end of the seed to the chalazal end (Fig 3A). Around 15% of the seeds showed an incomplete additional cell layer between the presumed endothelium (ii1) and the ii1&#8217; layer. In the tt16 mutant, the ii1 layer had often not divided properly, so that 19% of the seeds lacked the ii1&#180; layer at the chalazal side, over 13% showed only a partial ii1&#180; layer which failed to reach down to the chalazal end, and an additional cell layer was observed only once (0.7%). The ii1&#180; layer of the shp1 shp2 mutant appeared as in the wild type ecotypes. Interestingly, in the tt16 shp1 shp2 triple mutant, all seeds had at least a partial ii1&#180; layer at this developmental stage (missing ii1&#8217; occurred seldom in younger seeds with octant stage embryos as shown in S4E Fig). 88% of the seeds showed a complete ii1&#180; layer at the chalazal side, and 5% had an additional cell layer suggesting that the absence of SHP1 and SHP2 gene function partially reliefs the defects caused by the mutation in ABS. An effect of the distinct genetic backgrounds of the tt16 single (i.e. WS-4) and triple mutant line (i.e. mix of WS-4 and Col-0) can be excluded based on our data, as cell layer development was identical in both ecotypes. Details on the time course of the formative divisions in the inner seed coat can be deduced from S4A&#8211;S4E Fig which shows that the ii1&#180; layer proliferation does not proceed significantly during early postfertilization development at the chalazal side and that the tt16 mutant phenotype can already been detected at very early stages of seed development.The pattern of formative divisions in the inner seed coat was different at the micropylar side where development of the ii1&#180; layer continued for some time in all plant lines during early seed development (S4F&#8211;S4J Fig), and minor variations were found even between the wild type accessions (Fig 3B). The endothelium had divided properly and the ii1&#180; layer reached completely down to the micropylar end in only 35% and 21% of the seeds in Ws-4 and Col-0, respectively, but the ii1&#180; layer was absent in 23% and 16%, respectively. Interestingly, only 7% of the tt16 mutant seeds completely lacked the ii1&#180; layer at the micropylar side, but around 64% had a complete ii1&#180; layer, which develops at earlier developmental stages than in the other plant lines, including the Ws-4 wild type and the triple mutant to a minor extent (S4H and S4J Fig). While shp1 shp2 mutant seeds showed almost the same ratios of ii1&#180; layer present/absent than the Col-0 wild type (Fig 3B), the layer structure at the micropylar side of the inner tt16 shp1 shp2 mutant seed coat represented an intermediate of the tt16 mutant seeds on the one hand and the wild type and shp1 shp2 double mutant seeds on the other hand. The triple mutant showed 20% fewer seeds with a complete ii1&#180; layer (44%) than the tt16 single mutant but more than all other plant lines. Also, the percentage of triple mutant seeds lacking the ii1&#180; layer at the micropylar side (11%) is between the tt16 mutant and the other plant lines. This suggests again that SHP1 SHP2 and ABS may act antagonistically, although in this case effects caused by the distinct genetic background of the mutants must also be taken into account. Taken together these results suggest that ABS promotes the formative cell divisions of the endothelium (or ii1) at the chalazal side, but inhibits them at the micropylar side. And while the shp1 shp2 mutant seeds appear like (Col-0) wild types, the absence of SHP1 and SHP2 is able to partially rescue the effects of ABS loss of function.Further, we quantitatively analyzed also the morphology of the ii1&#8217; layer and the endothelium (or ii1) cells, as in many cases defects in the endothelium/ii1 layer coincided with defects in the neighboring ii1&#8217; layer (S3F and S3G Fig, also Fig 3C&#8211;3J and S4K&#8211;S4V Fig and Fig 4K&#8211;4V). At the chalazal side, wild type seeds of the Ws-4 and Col-0 ecotypes generally produced endothelium and ii1&#8217; layers made up of round cells as shown in Fig 3C and 3D, only rarely showing an incomplete, additional layer (Fig 3C). Only in 14% of the Ws-4 seeds and 3% of the Col-0 seeds which had an at least partially developed ii1&#180; layer, the endothelium and/or ii1&#8217; layers were composed of thin cells at the chalazal side (S3F Fig). 24% of the shp1 shp2 mutant seeds showed thin and elongated cells in the ii1 and/or ii1&#8217; layers, but the cell morphology was roundish in the majority of seeds (76%; S3F Fig, Fig 3E and 3F), with an additional layer observed in rare cases (Fig 3E). In more than 95% of the tt16 mutant seeds, however, the ii1 and/or ii1&#8217; layer were composed of thin elongated cells at the chalazal side (S3F Fig, Fig 3G, 3H and 3I), which corroborates the findings by Nesi et al. (2002) [27] and Debeaujon et al. (2003) [28]. Remarkably, 28% of the seeds developed normal morphology of the ii1 and ii1&#8217; cells when tt16 is combined with shp1 shp2 (S3F Fig). The inner seed coat layers of the triple mutant often had an intermediate cell shape which was elongated, but not as thin as in the tt16 single mutant (Fig 3J).On the micropylar side, the difference of the cell morphology in the inner seed coats was more pronounced between the two wild type accessions, with only 43% of the Ws-4 seeds but 71% of the Col-0 seeds showing round endothelium and ii1&#180; cells (S3G and S4K&#8211;S4P Figs). While the cell shape of the inner shp1 shp2 mutant seed coat was similar to the Col-0 wild type (S3G and S4Q Figs), only 20% of the tt16 seeds had round cells in the ii1 and/or ii1&#180; layer at the micropylar side (S3G, S4R and S4S Figs). And again, when the two mutants are combined in the tt16 shp1 shp2 plants, their seeds ranged between the two individual mutant lines and closely resembled the Ws-4 wild type with around 45% of the seeds showing round ii1 and ii1&#8217; cells the micropylar side (S3G and S4T&#8211;S4V Figs).As far as can be deduced from the observation of cleared seeds, endothelium/ii1 cells of both wild types and the shp1 shp2 double mutant showed a .showed remnants of a dense cytoplasmic content (Fig 3C&#8211;3F, S4K, S4L and S4N&#8211;S4Q Fig; with rare exceptions, S4M Fig) which is probably due to the relatively low degree of vacuolization and/or to pigment accumulation in this cell layer [4].However, this feature was lacking in most ii1 cells of the single tt16 mutant, and also in the triple mutant (Fig 3G&#8211;3J, S4R&#8211;S4V Fig) which corroborates the previous observation of a higher degree of vacuolization and compromised PA biosynthesis in the ii1 layer of the tt16 mutant [27, 28].In summary, our analysis shows that ABS directs formative cell divisions of the innermost seed coat layer on the chalazal as well as on the micropylar side. Moreover, ABS is also required for the final cell shape of the endothelium (or ii1) and its neighboring ii1&#8217; layer. In contrast, SHP1 and SHP2 loss of function has hardly any influence on cell division pattern or shape of the inner seed coat layers. But in all cases observed, the periclinal cell division defects and cell shape alterations observed in the tt16 mutant are at least partially restored by the additional loss of SHP1 and SHP2 gene function, except for the changes in cytoplasm density.\nDefects in ovule formation trigger inner seed coat layer malformation and delayed fertilization/seed development\nThe data presented in Fig 2A suggest a role for SHP1 and SHP2 in the synchronization of ovule/seed maturation and/or fertilization, while Fig 3 and S4 Fig show that ABS influences development of the inner seed coat layers. Because these layers are already formed as inner integument during ovule development, ovule morphology before fertilization of wild type and mutant lines was observed carefully. Ovules of Ws-4 and Col-0 plants develop in a very similar fashion (Fig 4A&#8211;4C, S2A&#8211;S2D Fig). In very young ovules, the two outer integument cell layers of the ovule encase the nucellus and the inner integument, and the two inner integument cell layers continue to grow towards the micropylar end (S2A Fig). Later, the outer and inner integuments surround the nucellus fully except for a small gap at the micropyle (S2B Fig). Both integuments are composed of two cell layers each (oi1, oi2, ii1, and ii2, terminology after Beeckman et al., 2000 [46]), but during gametogenesis, the innermost ii1 layer will divide further by successive periclinal divisions starting at the chalazal end and proceeding towards the micropylar end (S2B, S2C and S2D Fig). The newly formed layer, termed ii1&#8217; is sandwiched between the ii1 and ii2 layers on the adaxial and abaxial side of the ovule. Fig 4A and 4B illustrate ovule morphology before fertilization by depicting the five integument cell layers and the eight-nucleate embryo sac. In Fig 4C, the position of the ii1&#180; layer is indicated to allow comparison with the mutant lines. We focused on the abaxial ovule side which is most decisive for future seed coat development, because the integument cells in the curving zone will undergo a massive expansion after fertilization and cover the surface of the developing seed (Fig 4B, S2D and S2E Fig; [46]).In the tt16 plants, ovules may develop normally (Fig 4D) but in accordance with the findings of Debeaujon et al. (2003) [28], often several of the ii1 cells at the outermost chalazal end of the abaxial ovule side fail to induce periclinal divisions to generate the fifth layer (Fig 4E). However, the position of the formative cell divisions was only spatially shifted towards the micropylar end and, with a few exceptions (Fig 4E), the overall length of the newly formed ii1&#180; layer was not affected. This spatial shift of ii1 cell divisions may cause the relocation of the ii1&#180; layer observed in developing tt16 seeds (see Fig 3A and 3B). Sometimes, the ii1 division pattern was irregular (Fig 4F) which was not anticipated from the observation of the tt16 seed coat phenotype. The initial gaps in the ii1&#180; layer must be filled in later developmental stages, as a patchy ii1&#180; layer phenotype was no longer observed in developing tt16 mutant seeds. In contrast to the findings of Debeaujon et al. (2003) [28], we did not observe additional periclinal divisions forming a locally restricted fourth inner integument layer at the abaxial side of the tt16 ovules. Also, the percentage of developing seeds with an additional inner seed coat layer was lower with the tt16 mutant in comparison to the other plant lines (see Fig 3A). Analysis of shp1 shp2 ovules shows that, unlike in tt16 ovules, their morphology resembles wild type, but asynchronously developed ovules of different developmental stages are regularly found in one pistil (Fig 4G and 4H, see Fig 2A). tt16 shp1 shp2 gynoecium mutants showed additive effects of the two mutant phenotypes: several ovules resembling those of the wild type were found (Fig 4I). However, many ovules showed a lack of formative cell divisions of the innermost integument layer at the chalazal end (Fig 4J), patchy initiation of periclinal divisions, or the arrangement of ovules with different developmental stages within the same pistil (Fig 4K and 4L).In summary, the mutant phenotypes observed during seed development are already largely based on defects in ovule formation: highly asynchronous ovule development is indicative for the shp1 shp2 mutants and ABS loss of function causes severe defects in the formative division pattern of the inner integument.\nRegulation of seed-related MADS-box gene expression by \nThe expression of ABS has been elucidated only partially [47, 18, 27, 48]. We thus performed GUS staining assay for which 3.5 kb upstream of the transcription start site, and ABS exons and introns were fused to the GUS coding region and the GUS staining pattern was observed.In stage 10 buds, when the embryo sac has not formed yet, GUS staining in the pABS::ABS:GUS line was observed in the nucellus and, albeit weaker, in the inner integument (Fig 5A). In mature ovules of stage 13 flowers just before fertilization, pABS::ABS:GUS staining was observed in the inner integuments and at the chalazal end of the ovule while the micropylar end remained unstained (Fig 5B), resembling the in situ hybridization pattern of ABS shown in Mizzotti et al. (2012) [18]. After fertilization, when the embryo is in the globular stage, expression decreased and GUS staining was visible only in the region of the chalazal endosperm of the pABS::ABS:GUS line (Fig 5C) where it remains restricted also when the embryo is at heart stage (Fig 5D). Even at later developmental stages (data not shown), GUS staining was never observed in the fruit outside the developing seeds. Our results deviated slightly, only after fertilization, from the ones published by Xu et al. (2016) [48] as a shorter promoter fragment of ABS (1,6 kb) was used to drive, together with the genomic locus, the GUS expression in their work.We were then interested in elucidating the genetic interactions between ABS and SHP1/SHP2 as previous work has shown that their expression patterns overlap [49, 50] and because our data suggest a genetic interaction between ABS and SHP1/SHP2 (Fig 3 and S3F, S3G and S4 Figs).For quantification of expression and the identification of additional putative genetic interactors of ABS, SHP1, and SHP2, we then selected two more MADS box genes for qRT-PCR analysis: FRUITFUL (FUL), a gene that is known to repress SHP1 and SHP2 [36] and AGAMOUS-Like 15 (AGL15), which is known to act in embryogenesis and seed development [51]. The expression levels of these six MADS box genes were observed by qRT-PCR in stage 1&#8211;12 floral buds (Fig 6A) and stage 17A siliques, when all floral organs have dehisced and the siliques are ~1 cm in length (Fig 6B).Unexpectedly, the expression analysis shows different expression levels of these highly conserved MADS-box genes in Ws-4 and Col-0 wild types. For some of the genes tested this was observed in both tissues, but more pronounced in stage 17A siliques (Fig 6A and 6B). While this may suggest sequence dissimilarities in cis-regulatory regions, this limits observations, as the tt16-1 mutant is an INRA-Versaille mutant line whose parental line is Ws-4, the shp1 shp2 mutant is in Col-0 and the triple mutant is a mix of both ecotypes. We thus compare the expression in tt16 lines to Ws-4, the expression of shp1 shp2 to Col-0 and the tt16 shp1 shp2 expression to both wild type accessions. Our analysis does not allow the distinction between direct and indirect regulation of target genes, in the following section we thus describe activation/repression with keeping in mind that the interaction can be direct or indirect.In the floral buds (Fig 6A), the expression of SHP1, but not SHP2 increased in the tt16 mutant suggesting that ABS negatively regulates SHP1 expression, and in the shp1 shp2 double mutant, ABS expression is up-regulated. This suggests mutual negative regulation between ABS and SHP1/SHP2. The expression level of AGL15 and STK was not affected significantly by the loss of neither ABS, nor SHP1/SHP2, but FUL expression increased significantly in tt16 mutants.Interestingly, the genetic interactions between the transcription factors changed between pre- and post-fertilization. When seed development is well under way in stage 17A (Fig 6B), ABS no longer shows significant increase in expression in shp1 shp2 mutants and, at this developmental stage, SHP2 but not SHP1 is up regulated in the tt16 mutant. This suggests individual regulatory differences between SHP1 and SHP2 which may or may not result in functional differences between these genes in seed development. Regulation of AGL15 and STK expression seems unaffected by ABS, SHP1 and SHP2 loss of function. However, as in the bud stage, FUL is up-regulated in tt16 mutants suggesting that the negative regulation of FUL by ABS remains unchanged by fertilization.Our expression analysis shows that five MADS-box genes known to play important roles in ovule and seed development in part interact genetically in a complex network that changes components and direction of regulation in a stage-dependent manner (Fig 6C). While ABS directly or indirectly represses SHP1 or SHP2 expression, ABS is repressed by SHP1 and/or SHP2 only before fertilization. FUL repression by ABS was observed in both stages. AGL15 and STK expression does not seem to be significantly affected by the loss of ABS and/or SHP1 and SHP2 in floral buds or siliques.\nDiscussion\nOur work has provided quantitative data on the phenotypic effects of ABS loss of function in combination with loss of SHP1 and SHP2. While ovule development commences in tt16 mutants almost as efficiently as in the wild type, with the exception of a single integument layer sometimes not properly formed, we see deleterious effects of the tt16 mutation after fertilization in inner seed coat layers and endosperm development. The SHP1 and SHP2 genes on the other hand are required for proper timing and synchronization of ovule development and/or the fertilization process which occurs more erratic in shp1 shp2 mutants. Additionally, this work shows that SHP1 and SHP2 play an important role in seed coat differentiation.\nNone\nOvule development ends after megagametogenesis with the generation of the third inner integument cell layer by periclinal divisions of the innermost ii1 layer. The work presented in Fig 4 shows that ABS is essential for this process as in the tt16 mutants, the ii1 layer divides in an uncoordinated way resulting in a patchy distribution or locally missing ii1&#8217; layer. Several details of our work indicate that the formative divisions of the inner integument are controlled by strictly unipolar positional signaling: (i) the successive divisions giving rise to the ii1&#180; layer always proceed from the chalazal to the micropylar end (Fig 4, S2 Fig; [46]), (ii) after fertilization, formative divisions continue only at the micropylar side of the developing seed (S4A&#8211;S4J Fig), (iii) failure of formative divisions at the chalazal end of the tt16 mutant ovules (Fig 4E) cannot be compensated for during seed development so that the ii1&#180; layer is lacking on the chalazal side but reaches further down towards the micropylar end (Fig 3A and 3B), and (iv) gaps in the ii1&#180; layer caused by the patchy layer initiation in the tt16 mutant ovules (Fig 4F) can be filled during further development, as the irregular ii1&#180; layer phenotype was no longer observed with developing tt16 mutant seeds. However, while ABS controls the spatial position of formative divisions, it normally does not affect their number.While ovule development and fertilization are largely unaffected by the loss of ABS function, around half of the tt16 seeds show defects after fertilization. In these seeds, and also in the triple mutant, peripheral endosperm nuclei are not formed (Fig 2F and 2J) or only few endosperm nuclei are produced (Fig 2G and 2K) resulting in developing seeds that fail to expand (Fig 1E and 1G) and that will ultimately deliver less nutrients to the developing embryo resulting in seedlings that suffer from small size, fused organs, and lack of organs (Fig 1N&#8211;1R). But remarkably, the seedling defects were found in particular with the tt16 shp1 shp2 triple mutant and not with the tt16 single mutant (Fig 1B), although endosperm defects occurred in both plant lines.ABS expression was observed in the inner integument and the nucellus at the chalazal end (Fig 5A), and also SHP2 expression can be observed in ovules, but seems more broadly expressed [50]. But while SHP1 and SHP2 mRNA abundance remains at high levels in the seed coat and endosperm throughout seed development [54], ABS mRNA can hardly be detected after fertilization and can be seen only in the chalazal endosperm and no expression was found in the embryo (Fig 5C and 5D; [55, 54]).Other important regulators of endosperm size and inner seed coat development are the HAIKU (IKU) genes [10]. Loss of IKU gene function also results in dramatically decreased endosperm size with seeds that are smaller but are shaped similarly to wild type seeds. As expected, the IKU genes are expressed after fertilization [10], while ABS expression decreases dramatically after fertilization (Fig 5C and 5D). Another important difference in phenotypes between the two mutations is that the inner seed coat layers of tt16 are longer and thinner than in the wild type (Fig 3C&#8211;3J, S3F, S3G and S4K&#8211;S4V Figs) while in the iku mutants they are shorter [10]. This suggests that a reduction of the amount of endosperm in the developing seed may not necessarily coincide with cells of the inner seed coat layers being shorter, but also with elongated, thinner cells with lower cytoplasm density. The results presented in this work on bleached seeds show that the ii1 cells of tt16 and tt16 shp1 shp2 mutants show a less dense cytoplasm. This is in accordance to previous work suggesting that the ii1 cells of the tt16 single and triple mutants may have the identity of parenchyma rather than endothelium cells and that this may be a more crucial character for endosperm development than cell shape (Fig 3C&#8211;3J, S4K&#8211;S4V Fig, [27, 28]). Altered cell identity may cause altered gene expression and, consequently, different influences on endosperm and embryo development. This was also shown previously for the differential regulation of the BANYULS promoter in the different regions of the curving zone which also coincides with different cell division behavior (called region 2/div+ and region 2/div- by Debeaujon et al., 2003 [28]).However, we cannot discriminate between the two possible scenarios: (i) that ABS directs both, endosperm proliferation and inner seed coat development. One hint towards this hypothesis comes from the expression analysis presented in Fig 5C and 5D and Xu et al., 2016 [48] where the ABS protein can be detected in the chalazal endosperm after fertilization but not in the seed coat layers. While ABS is expressed in the chalazal part of the endosperm, it directs mainly the development of the peripheral part of the endosperm, at least at the chalazal end of the seed. Or (ii), the modified distribution of inner integument cell layers and the altered ii1 cell identity caused by tt16 indirectly result in fewer endosperm nuclei and later in fewer endosperm cells. One may then hypothesize that ABS directs endosperm development indirectly by ensuring proper identity of the inner integument layers which, in turn is required for endosperm formation. Thus, defects in seed coat proliferation and morphology before fertilization may cause defects in endosperm formation after fertilization [11], and ABS is involved in the regulation of this process. This hypothesis is also supported by recent work from Xu et al., 2016 [48] who show that nucellus degeneration after fertilization is required for chalazal endosperm development and positioning and that ABS plays a major role in this process.\nSeed coat differentiation requires \nSeed coat development is essentially a consequence of fertilization. Unlike the embryo, sexually formed endosperm triggers the differentiation of integuments into endothelial cells. This has been shown in kokopelli mutant where only a single sperm cell is produced by the male gametophyte leading to a single fertilization event. Here only when the central cell is fertilized the seed coat development commences but not when the egg cell is fertilized [56]. Furthermore, Roszak et al. (2011) [57] showed that polycomb group proteins that are expressed in the ovule integument suppress seed coat formation in the absence of fertilization and the authors identified AGL62 as the gene responsible in the formation of such mobile signal that establishes the communication between endosperm and integument. This indicates that there is a cross-talk between the fertile part and the maternal sporophytic tissue. Our results also show the association between defect in integument development and endosperm proliferation in tt16 mutant background genotype. Since ABS transcripts are present in the ovule integument but not in the seed coat, we speculate that signaling molecules originating from the integuments spread to the female gametophyte which are essential for the peripheral endosperm proliferation. As the ABS protein is unable to move between endothelium cells it has been suggested earlier to initiate a signaling cascade spreading across nucellus and endothelium [48]. A similar signaling pathway can be proposed to remain until later in development allowing peripheral endosperm proliferation.One role of ABS in seed coat development has been described already by Nesi et al. (2002) [27] and Debeaujon et al., (2003) [28] as regulator of the important PA pathway gene BANYULS (BAN). And indeed, tt16 seeds are straw colored due to the lack of PA except for a small brown dot at the chalazal part of the seed coat (Fig 1E, S1C Fig). In the tt16 mutant, residual expression of BAN remains in the chalazal bulb [27] in a region where ABS is expressed exclusively after fertilization. This suggests an additional spatial component of the ABS-BAN interaction as the late expression domain of ABS seems to not influence BAN transcript abundance.The PA&#8217;s accumulate in the endothelium where also the tt16 phenotype is occurring in particular (Fig 3, [28, 27]). But tt16 seeds are also impaired in mucilage production (Fig 1J and S1H Fig) suggesting that ABS also affects differentiation of the outer layer of the seed coat in the last phases of seed development without ever being expressed there. These observations suggest a transport mechanism from the inner seed coat layers to the outer ones or, alternatively, from the chalazal end to the outer seed coat layer(s) [58]. This transport mechanism is most likely not relevant for ABS, as the GUS staining in our experiment (Fig 5C and 5D) is not only dependent on the ABS promoter activities but also on the ABS protein stability and transport. And a translocation to the outer integuments or a specifically long persistence in the inner seed coat layers cannot be observed, moreover, late ABS expression was found in the chalazal endosperm rather than in the chalaza region itself (Fig 5C and 5D). More likely, an unknown target of ABS mediates the interaction with the outer seed coat layers and bridges the temporal gap between ABS expression and exertion of its function.The SHP genes have so far not been reported to play a role in seed coat development. However, Fig 1K and S1I Fig show that mucilage production or release in shp1 shp2 seeds is patchy and the mucilage layer is thinner than in wild type. A recent review by Francoz et al. (2015) [59] summarizes the genetic network known to date involved in the regulation of mucilage production and the morphological changes to the epidermis allowing mucilage production, storage, and release, however, this network does not incorporate any MADS-box transcription factors. In tt16 shp1 shp2 mutants, hardly any mucilage can be observed (Fig 1L and S1J Fig) and these seeds cannot be moistened, rather, they float on water surfaces. Quantitative data for seed coat expression can be derived from Belmonte et al. (2013) [54] indicating a strong and persisting SHP1 and SHP2 expression in the seed coat and Khan et al. (2014) [60] place SHP1 and SHP2 into a regulatory network directing seed coat development based on co-expression analysis. Here, we provide experimental evidence that SHP1 and SHP2 indeed have an important role in the differentiation of the epidermal seed coat layer.In summary, ABS is required for PA accumulation in the seed coat. ABS is also, together with SHP1 and SHP2, involved in the regulation of mucilage production (Fig 1J&#8211;1L) which is important during seed germination as the seeds remain in contact with the soil when the mucilage has expanded by accumulating water. The physiological role for mucilage production remains unclear, as several functions have been proposed but little experimental evidence supports them. Mucilage maybe required for sinking the seed in water and for its adhesive properties leading to efficient long-distance transport by animals [61]. And thirdly, ABS is required for endosperm development that later supplies nutrients to the embryo and a sufficient amount of endosperm is thus a prerequisite for seedling development even well after germination (Fig 1N&#8211;1R).In the natural environment of A. thaliana seeds, which is characterized by multiple stressors like osmotic challenges, water scarcity, UV-stress, flooding, and many more, ABS gene function is, together with SHP1 and SHP2, most likely critical for the most vulnerable phase of the plant&#8217;s life&#8212;seed germination and seedling survival.\nA MADS-box gene regulatory network for seed development\nAs most transcription factors, the proteins encoded by MADS-box genes bind to promoters of target genes, which in many cases are also transcription factors, but also genes involved in hormone response, cellular differentiation, pattern formation and many more [62]. The phenotype and expression analysis presented here provide an insight in the genetic interaction of selected ovule and seed morphogenesis regulators.The genetic interactions of MADS transcription factors in seed development are not well understood to date and only few genetic interactions have been described so far, such as the negative regulation of SHP1 and SHP2 by FUL during dehiscence zone development at very late stages of fruit maturation [45]. Recent analyses have shown by ChIP and microarray analyses that ABS, SHP1, SHP2, and AGL15 are direct targets of the carpel identity gene AGAMOUS (AG), but FUL and STK are not [52]. However, AG is expressed comparatively early during flower development, at inception of the carpel meristem and remains expressed throughout carpel development. Specifically in the late stages of ovule development, AG expression is found in the inner cell layers of the inner integument [63]. During ovule development, AG and ABS are co-expressed indicating that the regulation of ABS by AG may persist during ovule development.The expression analysis presented in this work (Fig 6) suggests that most of the genes analyzed in this work exert their function as repressors of the other transcription factors involved, as in the case of ABS&#8212;SHP1/SHP2 and ABS&#8211;FUL, and these are in part of mutually repressive relationship. However, SHP1, SHP2, and FUL are also expressed in the valve margins and valves, respectively, but ABS expression is restricted to ovules. Thus, the genetic network involving ABS is restricted to ovule and seed development.While the repression of FUL and SHP1/SHP2 expression by ABS occurs before and after fertilization, the action of SHP1 and/or SHP2 changes to some extent after fertilization. This change of regulation may not come as a surprise as the developmental program changes upon fertilization and SHP1 and SHP2 are apparently part of this remodeling process.\nConclusions\nOur work suggests that ABS is not only required for the regulation of PA accumulation in the seed coat but that its functions are of much broader impact: they range from positively regulating coordinated cell divisions in the inner integument layer of the ovule, nuclear endosperm proliferation and thus seed cavity expansion, to regulating endothelium cell morphology, and to its influence on mucilage release of the seed coat epidermal cell layer. Novel roles could also be identified for SHP1 and SHP2: these genes are required for synchronized ovule maturation and subsequent fertilization/seed maturation, seed mucilage production, and have an inhibitory effect which is antagonistic to the ABS function in controlling formative divisions and cell shape of the inner integument and seed coat layers. Unlike SHP1 and SHP2, which are the result of a rather recent genome duplication and specific to the Brassicaceae [64], orthologs of ABS were present in the most recent common ancestor of gymnosperms and angiosperms [25]. The newly discovered function of ABS in endosperm development and its coordination with inner seed coat formation provide a hint towards original function of Bsister genes, which may be conserved throughout the seed plants. The ability to protect the zygote by integuments from the environment and to produce a nutritive tissue embedding and supporting the embryo and providing nutrients to the seedling after germination is one of the key traits to seed plant success to which the Bsister genes have contributed significantly.\nMaterials and Methods\n\nPlant material and growth conditions\nCol-0 and Ws-4 wild type plants, the tt16-1 T-DNA insertion line [27] obtained from the INRA-Versaille mutant populations whose parental line is Ws-4 (see information of the Nottingham Arabidopsis stock centre), and the shp1-1 shp2-1 double mutant T-DNA insertion line in the Col-0 background [36] were obtained from the Nottingham Arabidopsis stock centre (NASC) and were genotyped by PCR, the allele specific oligonucleotides are listed in S1 Table.A promoter GUS line for ABS (pABS::ABS:GUS) was created by cloning 3.5 kb ABS promoter region (entire intergenic region between the 5&#8217; gene and ABS start codon) and 1.8 kb ABS genomic locus in frame with GUS in the pGWB633 plasmid [65] using the Gateway&#174; recombination system (Life technologies GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany). A. thaliana Col-0 plants were transformed by Agrobacterium tumefaciens assisted floral dipping as mentioned previously [66] with the addition of 100 &#956;M acetosyringone and 25 g l-1 of sucrose to the dipping medium. F1 transformants were selected on soil by spraying 1 week old seedlings with 300 &#956;M Basta&#174; (Bayer GmbH, Germany) at an interval of 3 days for 3&#8211;5 times.All plants were sown on standard potting soil with perlite (ED73, H. Nitsch & Sohn GmbH & Co.KG, Kreuztal-Eichen, Germany), stratified for three days at 4&#176;C in the dark and then moved to growth cabinets set to long day conditions (16 h light: 150 &#956;mol m-2 s-1 photons, 22&#176;C; 8 h dark, 18&#176;C; relative humidity ~60%).For cotyledon greening assay on soil, 300 seeds per line were stratified and sown on soil as described above. Seedlings were scored as viable when the cotyledons were fully expanded and the first set of true leaves appeared. The average number of germinated seedlings and the standard deviation was calculated and the statistical significance of the difference between the wild type and mutant seed germination rates was analysed with a single factor ANOVA.\nOvule and seed morphology analyses\nWhole mount analyses of cleared ovules and seeds were performed to visualize the developing integuments and embryo sacs, as well as seed coats, endosperm tissues and embryos. Stage 12 flower buds (stages defined after Smyth et al., 1990 [67]) were randomly collected from 5 plants per genotype and stage 16 to 17A siliques were selected from at least 3 plants per genotype. For conventional light microscopy with differential interference contrast (DIC) optics, tissue fixation in 10% glacial acetic acid and 90% ethanol, dehydration and clearing with chloral hydrate was carried out as described in Yadegari et al. (1994) [68]. The substructures of dissected ovules and developing seeds were carefully analyzed with a Leica DM55003 microscope and photographed in different focus planes using the above mentioned camera system. In order to demonstrate all the details observed, most figures were mounted from DIC micrographs of different focus planes using Corel PHOTO-PAINT V10.0 (Corel Corporation, Ottawa, Canada). Ruthenium Red staining was performed according to Dean et al. (2011) [41] without shaking of the seeds.For the observation of wild type and mutant ovules with a confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM), stage 12 flower buds were either quickly fixed and dehydrated following the protocol of Yadegari et al. (1994) [68], or they were slowly fixed for 26h in a solution of 4% glutaraldehyde in 12.5 mM cacodylate, pH 7.2, and dehydrated in a graded ethanol series with 20 min per step (modified after Shi et al., 2005 [69]). All buds were stored at 4&#176;C and after a gradual rehydration, they were stained for five days in 5 mg/ml propidium iodide dissolved in water, before they were dehydrated again (see [70]). Pistils were isolated from the quickly fixed flowers and dissected ovules were cleared on a microscopic slide with chloral hydrate. The slowly fixed flowers were cleared in 2:1 (v/v) benzyl benzoate:benzyl alcohol for several hours before ovules were dissected and mounted with immersion oil on a microscopic slide [69]. All propidium-iodide stained ovules were observed with a 63x oil immersion objective at a Leica TCS SP5 VIS CLSM (Leica Microsystems, Mannheim, Germany) using excitation with the 488nm line of the argon laser and an emission window from 570 to 610 nm. Leica Application Suite software was used for automated z-stacks and image processing.\nExpression analysis\nGUS staining for the ABS promoter GUS line was performed as described previously [71] with clearing as described in Yadegari et al. (1994) [68] and documented by the microscope and camera mentioned above.For qRT-PCR, total RNA was isolated from Arabidopsis thaliana floral buds (mixture of stages 1&#8211;12) and stage 17A siliques using the plant-rna-OLS&#174; Kit (Omni Life Science, Germany). 1 &#956;g of RNA and random primer were used to synthesized first strand cDNA following the protocol of RevertAid&#8482;HMinus First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Fermentas, Germany). qRT-PCR was performed using Roche LightCycler&#174; 480 system (Roche, Germany) with a total reaction volume of 20 &#956;l containing 5 &#956;l of 1:50 diluted cDNA template, 1 &#956;l of each PCR primer (10 &#956;M), 3 &#956;l double distilled sterile water and 10 &#956;l SYBR Green I Master (Roche) and assayed with following cycling condition: initial heating of 95&#176;C for 5 min, 45 cycles of 10 s at 95&#176;C for denaturation, 10 s at 60&#176;C for primer annealing, and 10 s at 72&#176;C for extension. Exon-intron spanning primers were subjected to primer efficiency tests and are listed in S1 Table. ACTIN and EF1-&#945; were used as reference genes for floral bud and stage 17A tissue. Three biological replicates with two technical replicates were carried out for each data point and analysis of data was performed following the &#916;&#916;CT (cycle threshold) method [72].\nLipid analysis\nSeed fatty acid composition was analyzed on 0.1 g pooled seed samples from each individual genotype. Fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) were obtained from seed oil after petroleum ether extraction and transesterification with sodium methylate. FAME were transferred in iso-octane and analyzed in a capillary gas chromatograph (TRACE GC, Thermo Finnigan, Italia) equipped with an autosampler (AS 3000, Thermo Scientific) and configured as follows: Capillary column BPX70 (0.53mm ID, 30m length, SGE Analytical Science, Australia), 0.8&#956;l injection volume, injector temperature 260&#176;C, FID temperature 280&#176;C, gradient oven temperature 160&#176;C to 220&#176;C in 12 min, helium flow rate 3.1 ml min-1. Individual fatty acids were identified and quantified using an internal FAME standard (Rotichrom ME 51; Carl Roth, Germany) and recorded as the percentage of the total fatty acids per sample. To test for statistical significance of the differences in the observed seed fatty acid composition an ANOVA together with a LSD-test were performed using IBM SPSS statistics Version 21 (IBM Software, Armonk, NY, USA).\nSupporting Information\n", "pmid": "27776173", "title": "The MADS Box Genes ABS, SHP1, and SHP2 Are Essential for the Coordination of Cell Divisions in Ovule and Seed Coat Development and for Endosperm Formation in Arabidopsis thaliana", "journal_title": "PLoS ONE", "authors": "Katrin Ehlers;Amey S.

Baumeister&#8217;s popular strength-model captures two striking features of self-control: Self-control seems to be domain general and to rely on a limited resource [1]. These features would explain the phenomenon of so called &#8220;ego-depletion&#8221;: Exerting self-control in a first task weakens self-control in a second completely unrelated task [2]. For example suppressing emotional reactions while watching an emotional video can weaken the ability to persist in solving anagrams [3]. Likewise, suppressing specific thoughts during writing can weaken the ability to suppress emotional reactions while watching a movie [4]. Moreover, in most studies the negative effects of ego-depletion on performance in subsequent self-control demanding tasks is not mediated by changes in mood [2&#8211;5]. In connection to recent discussions that the development of ego-depletion effects might be more complex and fragile than expected [6], several authors (e.g. [6, 7]) have suggested that the ego-depletion phenomenon needs to be explored in greater detail.In specific, it has been criticized that the strength-model does not specify the underlying processes [7]. Accordingly, in their process-model Inzlicht et al. [7] propose that apparent failures of self-control after ego-depletion reflect a motivated shift of task priorities. This shift would enable people to balance cognitive labor to pursue &#8216;have-to&#8217; goals versus cognitive leisure to pursue &#8216;want to&#8217; goals [7]. One specific hypothesis about an underlying process of ego-depletion is that exerting self-control increases approach motivation [8]. This in turn should increase emotional reactions to appetitive cues like positive pictures [9]. Indeed, Wagner and colleagues report that ego-depletion increases the emotional reactivity of the amygdala to pictures [10] and the neural response to reward cues in the orbitofrontal cortex [11]. However, they do not report behavioral data of the emotional responses and the results of the first study were restricted to negative pictures. Furthermore, most behavioral studies have investigated the effect of ego-depletion on subsequent intentional suppression of emotional reactions but not on the incidental emotional reaction to stimuli (e.g. [4, 12]).In our study we test whether the depletion of cognitive self-control increases the emotional reaction to appetitive cues. The between-subject factor (depletion vs. control) was manipulated using a text copying task. Since weak ego-depletion effects on performance might be due to unfulfilled requirements for overriding habits during the ego-depletion manipulation task [6, 13], we applied a text copying task as a well-established and valid ego-depletion manipulation [14, 15]. The emotional evaluation of appetitive cues was assessed using a picture evaluation task. We presented positive pictures of delicious food, social interactions, young animals, or beautiful sceneries as well as neutral control pictures matched for content category. We hypothesize that depletion would increase valence and arousal ratings especially of the positive pictures.\nMaterials and methods\n\nEthics statement\nAll participants gave written informed consent before the beginning of the experiment. The study protocol was discussed and approved by the research colloquium of the Leibniz-Institute for Science and Mathematics Education and by the research colloquium of the department of psychology of the University of Kiel.\nParticipants\nThe required sample size was calculated using g*power (version 3.1.3 [16]). The expected effect size was derived from the meta-analysis by Hagger et al. [2] who reported a mean effect size of the depletion effect of Cohen&#8217;s d = 0.62. Muraven et al. [4] reported a study with 49 participants who were randomized to a depletion and a control condition. The dependent measures were emotional reactions during a humorous video watched after the manipulation. From the reported statistics we calculated the effect size d. The effect on the dependent measure &#8220;smiling&#8221; was d = 0.593 and the effect on &#8220;overall amusement&#8221; d = 0.558. In the light of recent critical papers [6, 17], we figured it would be fair to assume an effect size of at least d = 0.4 in our study. We calculated the required total sample size to detect an interaction effect in an ANOVA with a between-subject factor (Group: control vs. depleted) and a within-subject factor (Target Valence: neutral vs. positive). We assumed an alpha of .05, a minimal power of .95, and an effect size of f = 0.2 (d = 0.4). Furthermore we used a correlation coefficient of the repeated measures of r = .7 which we derived from other studies of our work group [18]. In fact the observed correlations were r = .635 for valence and r = .796 for arousal. According to g*power, the required total sample size is N = 52 to obtain a power greater than .95. Therefore our sample size of 69 should be on the save side.Sixty-nine students (55% female) aged 24.4 &#177; 5.2 (mean &#177; SD) were recruited at a university cafeteria and were paid 5 EUR for their participation. The participants were randomly divided into a control (n = 34, 53.0% female) and a depletion group (n = 35, 57.1% female). The groups did not differ regarding gender (&#967;2 = 0.05, p = .829), handedness (&#967;2 = 2.21, p = .332), age, secondary-school grade point average (GPA), or use of recreational drugs. Further details are reported in the results section.\nMaterial\nThe self-control strength was manipulated using an ego-depletion task devised by Bertrams (e.g. [15]). Participants were asked to copy a short text describing the history of the city Mannheim. No further instructions were given to the control group. However, the depletion group was instructed to skip all instances of the letters e and n, which are the most frequent letters in German. To comply with these restrictions participants had to inhibit their well-learned, automated writing habits and write in a controlled manner. The effectiveness of the task of depleting self-control strength has been shown in several experiments (e.g. [14, 15]).As a manipulation check we used a three-item effort scale (Cronbach&#8217;s &#945; = .801) measuring the self-control exerted during the text copying task [14, 15]. Participants rated how strenuous and how difficult the task was and how much effort they had to put into it on three 7-point Likert scales (1 &#8222;not at all&#8221;to 7 &#8222;very much so&#8220;). To control for mood we used the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS; German version by [19]) encompassing ten items for positive affect (e.g. &#8222;enthusiastic&#8220;) and ten items for negative affect (e.g. &#8222;nervous&#8220;) which were rated on 5-point Likert scales (1 &#8222;not at all&#8221;to 5 &#8222;extremely&#8220;). Descriptive statistics of the manipulation check are reported in Table 1.To measure the emotional evaluation of appetitive pictures we created two sets of 25 positive versus 25 neutral pictures parallelized for content categories but differing in the target valence. We selected high quality pictures from the internet that allude to certain motivational systems and are supposed to act as appetitive cues. In specific, positive pictures were chosen that allude to the affiliation motive (humans, e.g. &#8222;kissing couple&#8220;), to the motivation to care (animals, Kindchenschema, e.g. &#8222;cute duckling&#8220;), to hunger and appetite (food, e.g. &#8222;delicious cake&#8220;), or to the appreciation of beauty (sceneries, e.g. &#8222;tree by a beautiful lake&#8220;). Furthermore, for each positive picture we searched a neutral picture with similar content (e.g. humans: &#8220;couple in the office&#8221;, animals: &#8220;adult sparrow&#8221;, food: &#8220;grey-bread&#8221;, scenery: &#8220;tree by a parking lot&#8221;). The high resolution pictures were reduced to 800*600 pixels resolution, and standardized regarding luminance. Using an LCD projector, the pictures were individually presented for 2 seconds on a 3 by 2 m silver screen. After each picture participants rated their affect on the valence and arousal scales of the self-assessment manikin (SAM [20]).As a manipulation check we compared the valence and arousal ratings of neutral and positive pictures of all four content categories (humans, animals, food, sceneries). Descriptive data and t-tests are reported in Table 1. The neutral midpoint of the valence scale was 5. The mean valence ratings of the neutral picture categories ranged from 4.6 to 5.8 (neutral). The mean valence ratings of the positive picture categories ranged from 7.2 to 8.0 (positive). Furthermore, all t-tests comparing neutral and positive pictures were highly significant (all p< .001). The arousal scale ranged from 1 (no arousal) to 9 (very high arousal). The mean arousal ratings of the neutral picture categories ranged from 2.3 to 3.1 (low arousal). The mean arousal ratings of the positive picture categories ranged from 3.7 to 5.1 (low to medium arousal). However, all t-tests comparing neutral and positive pictures were highly significant (all p< .001). Therefore, we are confident that the neutral pictures were actually neutral and the positive pictures were actually positive.\nProcedure\nParticipants were randomly divided in ten small groups (5 control, 5 depletion) and seated at least two seats apart in a lecture room in front of the silver screen. After answering demographic questions, the manipulation and manipulation check were administered. Finally the pictures were presented in a pseudorandom order with target valence and content categories evenly distributed over the whole set and valence and arousal were rated.\nData analysis\nMixed design ANOVAs with Target-Valence (neutral vs. positive) as within-factor and Group (control vs. depletion) as between factor with subsequent t-tests were used to analyze the valence and arousal ratings of the pictures. To rule out that the results have been influenced by mood, we computed additional ANCOVAs using the positive and negative affect scales as covariates. To check whether the effect of ego-depletion was restricted to a single content category (e.g. food stimuli) we computed additional ANOVAS using Content category as another within-subject factor. In specific, mixed design ANOVAs of the valence and arousal ratings with the within-subject factors Target-Valence (neutral vs. positive) and Content (humans vs. animals vs. food vs. sceneries) and the between-subject factor Group (control vs. depletion) were computed.\nResults\nThe manipulation check confirmed that the depletion group experienced the text copying task as a more strenuous, difficult, and demanding effort than the control group (t67 = -5.90, p< .001). Still, the groups did not differ regarding positive or negative mood after the manipulation (positive affect scale: t67 = -1.05, p = .298; negative affect scale: t67 = -0.85, p = .400).Does ego-depletion bias the emotional evaluation of pictures? Indeed the valence and arousal ratings were differentially biased by the depletion manipulation (see Fig 1 and Table 2). An ANOVA of the valence ratings revealed an interaction of Target-Valence and Group (F1;67 = 5.96, p = .017). Subsequent t-tests showed that ego-depletion elicited higher valence ratings of neutral pictures (t67 = -2.00, p = .049) but not of positive pictures (t67 = 0.22, p = .825; see Fig 1A). Furthermore, a highly significant main effect of Target-Valence confirmed that the positive pictures were perceived as more positive than the neutral ones (F1;67 = 484.20, p< .001). This was true in the control group (t33 = -17.25, p< .001) as well as in the depletion group (t34 = -13.87, p< .001). There was no main effect of Group (F1;67 = 0.74, p = .393).An ANOVA of the arousal ratings revealed an interaction of Target-Valence and Group as well (F1;67 = 4.89, p = .031). Ego-depletion lowered the arousal ratings of positive pictures (t67 = 2.04, p = .045) but not of neutral pictures (t67 = 0.96, p = .342; see Fig 1B). Again a highly significant main effect of Target-Valence confirmed that positive pictures were rated as more arousing than neutral ones (F1;67 = 145.78, p< .001; control group: t33 = -9.72, p< .001; depletion group: t34 = -7.26, p< .001). Also there was no significant main effect of Group (F1;67 = 2.79, p = .100).Note that the differential effects of Target-Valence and Group on valence (F1;65 = 6.08, p = .016) and arousal (F1;65 = 4.34, p = .041) remain the same when we use the positive and negative affect scales as covariates.Moreover, in additional analyses using Content categories as a within-factor we did not find any interactions of Content categories with Group: An ANOVA of the valence ratings with the within-subject factors Target-Valence (neutral vs. positive) and Content (humans vs. animals vs. food vs. sceneries) and the between-subject factor Group (control vs. depletion) revealed no interactions of Content with Group (F3; 198 = 0.98, p = .403) and no interaction of Content with Target-Valence and Group (F3; 198 = 2.11, p = .101). Again the interaction of Target-Valence and Group reported above remained stable (F1; 66 = 4.22, p = .044). An ANOVA of the arousal ratings with the within-subject factors Target-Valence (neutral vs. positive) and Content (humans vs. animals vs. food vs. sceneries) and the between-subject factor Group (control vs. depletion) revealed no interactions of Content with Group (F3; 198 = 0.85, p = .467) and no interaction of Content with Target-Valence and Group (F3; 198 = 0.29, p = .835). Again the interaction of Target-Valence and Group reported above remained stable (F1; 66 = 5.00, p = .029). In summary, there is no indication that the effect of depletion on valence and arousal was driven by specific content categories.\nDiscussion\nThis study tested the hypothesis that ego-depletion increases approach motivation and thereby changes the emotional evaluation of appetitive cues [8]. Ego-depletion caused more positive valence ratings of neutral pictures and lower arousal ratings of positive pictures.The manipulation was successful. The depletion variant of the text copying task was experienced as more straining but did not change mood. Neither did mood explain the change of the emotional evaluation of pictures. Furthermore, positive pictures elicited higher valence and arousal ratings as their neutral counterparts. However, we cannot rule out that floor- and ceiling effects restricted the influence of ego-depletion to the valence of neutral and the arousal of positive pictures. Finally, the control and experimental groups did not differ regarding age, gender, handedness, GPA or drug use.In some aspects our results confirm the hypothesis by Schmeichel and colleagues [8] that the depletion of self-control increases approach motivation: In the eye of depleted people neutral pictures of humans, animals, food and sceneries became more appealing. In contrast already appealing pictures elicited less arousal, which contradicts the hypothesis of a general increase in approach motivation. Also the reduced arousal speaks against the hypothesis that depletion of self-control amplifies whatever urges or emotions the person has at the moment [21, 22].Apart from that, our results do not contradict the study by Wagner at al. mentioned above [10] where ego-depletion did not increase emotional reactivity of the amygdala as a response to neutral or positive pictures. However, our results do not match the other study by Wagner et al. [11] that found increased neuronal responses to pictures of food but not to pictures of people or sceneries in ego-depleted chronic dieters. This suggests that a specific motivational context is necessary for ego-depletion to increase approach motivation in the respective area, e.g. the context of chronic dieting in concert with ego-depletion might increase approach motivation for food [5] or the context of habitual heavy drinking in concert with ego-depletion might increase approach motivation for alcohol [23].Our results are limited to the conscious aspect of emotional reactions. It is possible that non-reactive measures like facial or galvanic skin responses would yield similar results as the studies by Wagner and colleagues [10, 11]. Moreover, we focused on the emotional evaluation of appetitive cues but did not assess actual approach behavior. If the participants in our study had the prospect of e.g. actual food or social reward, the effect of ego-depletion on the emotional evaluation of cues for food or affiliation might have been stronger.In the domain of avoidance motivation, Bertrams et al. [15] documented the importance of motivational context, namely the role of anxiety. In the domain of approach motivation, future studies should manipulate the motivational context, e.g. by sexual- or food-deprivation, to investigate the effect of ego-depletion on the evaluation of appetitive cues and actual approach behavior. Nevertheless, our study provides a first step for understanding the influence of ego-depletion on the emotional evaluation of appetitive pictures.", "pmid": "28141811", "title": "Weakening self-control biases the emotional evaluation of appetitive cues", "journal_title": "PLoS ONE", "authors": "Christian Dirk Wiesner;Christoph Lindner", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0170245", "score": "0.021748103"}, {"keywords": "Postgraduate medical training;postgraduate medical education;residency;learning process;quality assurance;gender discrimination", "abstract": "Objective: In order to evaluate the quality of postgraduate medical education in Germany, we examined how the learning of theoretical and practical competencies is conceptualized and how the learning process takes place in real terms. The training conditions, as perceived by medical residents, are compared with the learning objectives, as stated by the Federal Chamber of Physicians in its regulation on postgraduate education. The analysis is based on the data of the &#8220;KarMed&#8221; study (abbreviation of \"career progression and career breaks among physicians during postgraduate education\"), a multicentre cohort study of medical school graduates from seven universities who arre followed until they receive their licenses as specialist physicians.

Descriptive statistics and logistical regressions were used for analysis. Gender-specific analyses were performed where possible in order to highlight the differences in the professional objectives and workloads between female and male physicians. \nResults: The study shows that both the practical and the theoretical components of postgraduate medical education in Germany are insufficient. There is a lack of a curriculum with precise learning objectives and descriptions of the corresponding educational settings. In fact, the act of learning is identical to daily clinical work. There is no structuring of the work process with regard to learning; for example, documentation procedures and feedback discussions are prescribed but largely omitted. Evidence-based medicine is not a systematic part of the training, nor is the evaluation of residents&#8217; progress. The summative final oral examination pretends that the necessary specialist competencies can be evaluated within 30 minutes.\nMany factors indicate that female doctors, especially those with children, have fewer learning opportunities than male doctors.\nConclusion: The quality of postgraduate medical education in Germany has become inadequate, especially in an international comparison. The deficits are well known. The responsible institutions are called upon to implement sustainable reforms in the sense of postgraduate education that is structured according to educational principles and whose quality is assured.", "body": "1. Background\nIn all industrialized countries, the process of qualifying doctors is traditionally divided into two phases: undergraduate medical education (UGE) and, subsequently, postgraduate medical education (PGE), also called postgraduate training or vocational training. In Europe, both phases have a comparable real duration of approximately 6-7 years in most countries [1].UGE in Germany is regulated by the Approbation for Physicians (&#8220;Approbation f&#252;r &#196;rzte und &#196;rztinnen&#8221; [https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/_appro_2002/BJNR240500002.html]), a directive issued by the Federal Ministry of Health with the consent of the Upper House of Parliament (&#8220;Bundesrat&#8221;), whereas PGE is based on regulations (&#8220;Weiterbildungsordnung&#8221; [http://www.aerztekammer-hamburg.org/wbo.html]) issued by the Regional Chambers of Physicians on the basis of a proposal (&#8220;Musterweiterbildungsordnung&#8221; [http://www.bundesaerztekammer.de/aerzte/aus-weiter-fortbildung/weiterbildung/muster-weiterbildungsordnung/]) developed under the aegis of the Federal Chamber of Physicians (&#8220;Bundes&#228;rztekammer&#8221;). The regional chambers&#8217; responsibility for PGE is delegated by the governments of the regional states, which are supposed to control the chambers. In reality, PGE is completely steered by the chambers. While a plethora of political and scientific institutions and organizations comment on UGE, postgraduate education is almost completely out of public view. As a result, there have been only few studies and memoranda on PGE in Germany [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. Questions concerning the future supply and demand of physicians play a role in the debates surrounding UGE, but this not the case with PGE. The analyses of PGE presented in this paper are largely based on the results of a multicentre prospective cohort study of graduates from seven medical schools (n=1012) conducted by the Institute of Primary Medical Care at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (&#8220;KarMed&#8221; study) since 2008. The KarMed study uses annual, standardised questionnaires to follow the graduates until they acquire their licenses as specialist physicians, including primary care specialists.This paper examines, firstly, the question of how the theoretical and practical components of PGE are actually administered and acquired in the training hospitals. It also examines how the residents, on the one hand, and the Chambers of Physicians, on the other, assess the quality of the training. Special attention is given to gender differences.\n2. Methods\nResidents were followed using annually administered, standardised questionnaires during the period of their training from graduation to their licensure as a specialist physician. The results presented in this paper refer to the end of the fourth year of residency. In a few cases, results from previous KarMed surveys are also presented. Due to limitations of scope, reference must be made here to other KarMed publications [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16]. For the specific problems of PGE for primary care, we refer to separate publications [17], [18].For further details on the methodology of the KarMed study see the paper by Ziegler et al. in this issue [16].\n3. Results\n\n3.1. Study cohort\nFor details on the KarMed cohort see Ziegler et al. in this issue [16].\n3.2. Learning conditions and learning outcomes \nMedical residents in Germany have the status of a physician employed by the hospital. They work full-time in the hospital without any protected time for research or educational activities. Training positions are not allocated; residents have to locate and apply for a position within the hospital labour market on their own. The employment contract does not contain any significant regulation regarding the educational entitlements and duties of the resident. There is no written agreement between the mentor and the resident describing the educational obligations of both sides.The resident receives a full salary on the basis of the annual negotiations between the national trade union of physicians and the hospital trustee associations. Extra payment is provided for night and weekend duties. Current contracts vary between 38.5 and 48 hours per week, although the actual average shows a mean of 46 hours per week (night and weekend duties excluded).As a result of this contractual status, residents are fully involved in the treatment of inpatients and outpatients in daily hospital care. Residents learn how to deal with a variety of patients and their conditions in all units of their discipline (in- and outpatient wards, intensive care, operating theatres etc.). The assignment to units and tasks is the responsibility of the chief physician of the department. Residents are assigned to units according to a simple scheme based on their presumed maturity (e.g. no intensive care unit in their first year). The extent to which the qualification of the individual resident is considered in these assignments may vary (see section 3.2.2). PGE is therefore characterized by learning on the job with very few organized learning events (e.g. seminars or courses) in either the training hospital or in the medical school (see section 3.2.3). \n3.2.1. Training requirements in postgraduate educational regulations \nThe regulations document issued by the Federal Chamber, as described in section 1, is the main regulatory instrument for PGE [http://www.bundesaerztekammer.de/aerzte/aus-weiter-fortbildung/weiterbildung/muster-weiterbildungsordnung/]. These regulations contain the following essential rules: Minimum number of months/years in the main and adjacent discipline and/or health care facilities (primarily hospitals) needed for graduation.Minimum numbers of procedures to be performed (operations, diagnostic interventions) contained in so-called \"catalogues\".The obligation to document the procedures described above annually in a \"logbook\", to be signed by the mentor of the resident. This is regularly the chief physician of the department.Annual interviews between mentor and resident on the basis of the logbooks, in which the state of progress is to be judged by both. Existing deficits must be noted. The minutes of these interviews must be signed by both and attached to the application for admission to the final examination (see below).The training hospital must deliver a so-called \"structured training plan\" to the resident at the start of the training. This usually includes little more than the pathway through the department units in the individual years of training. At the end of PGE, the mentor has to issue a certificate to the resident, in which the experience and skills of the resident are described and it is stated that the candidate is fully qualified for the specialist certificate. \n3.2.2. The state of practical training\nAs stated above, PGE consists almost exclusively of daily work in the hospital. As a consequence, access to interventional activities (surgical procedures, endoscopies etc.) is also unregulated. The decision that a resident may participate in such activities is made primarily according to the daily requirements of the department and the availability of the medical workforce, with little basis in the learning interests of the residents.The lack of regulations concerning access to learning settings and daily work experience leads to competition among nearly all physicians in a department [19], [20]. Younger physicians would like to quickly participate in the easier procedures listed in the catalogues in order to end up with a full portfolio at the end of their PGE. However, residents at the end of their training do not always feel qualified enough to practice independently. In addition, they also want to gain experience with more complex interventions. This also applies to the licenced specialists who remain in the hospital in order to qualify for a position as deputy director (&#8220;Oberarzt&#8221;), in order, for example, to be able to apply for a chief physician position in a district hospital later on. The less attractive tasks, such as ward work or outpatient consultations, are assigned to the younger residents. In this open competition, success is largely dependent on the presence and competiveness of the individual residents (see Ziegler et al. in this issue on the differences between male and female physicians; [16]).Attitudes of the residents in the KarMed study towards their practical learning conditions after four years of PGE are shown in Table 1 (Tab. 1). The attitudes were expressed on a five-point Likert scale (minimum agreement=1, maximum agreement=5, mean of scale=3).The items related to mentor and team (1-6) reveal that central competencies of the PGE and central educational activities (e.g. receiving feedback) received somewhat moderate scores. Negative estimations were given by female residents regarding their learning to take responsibility in patient care (row 1) and their reception of constructive feedback on the quality of their practical skills (row 5). In both cases, male physicians appreciate their training significantly more. Those items in Table 1 (Tab. 1) referring to the organization of practical training (items 7-10) show further significant deficits. Only 19% of the respondents agreed that there was a structured training plan that was also respected. Comparable negative results are shown in eight other studies [http://www.bundesaerztekammer.de/fileadmin/user_upload/downloads/EVA_Bundesrapport_final_16042010.pdf], [http://www.bundesaerztekammer.de/fileadmin/user_upload/downloads/BAeK_Ground4.pdf], [http://www.marburger-bund.de/projekte/mitgliederbefragung/2014], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25]. Likewise, more than half (58%) of the respondents disagreed with the statement that \"the interventions and operations to be documented for the final examination are regularly registered (e.g. in a logbook)&#8221;, and only 25% agreed explicitly with this statement. Comparable sizes were obtained in other surveys [http://www.marburger-bund.de/projekte/mitgliederbefragung/2014], [23]. In addition, 44% of the respondents answered that \"leading physicians regularly conduct interviews with the residents\". Other surveys yield comparable results [21], [23], [26]. When asked about mentoring, only 31% of the residents declared that they also received instruction from the chief physician of the department, who is usually the official mentor. Female physicians (29%) had a significantly (p=0.034) more negative opinion than males (34%). Further critical results on the real role of the PGE mentors are also found in other studies [21], [22], [27].In this respect, critical results in other studies on the conditions and outcomes of PGE were found for anaesthesiology [23], [24], surgery [25], [26], [27] and internal medicine [21], [26].\n3.2.3. The missing theoretical foundation of postgraduate medical education\nEvery effective practical learning process needs a theoretical foundation. The term \"theoretical\" in this study refers to all structured teaching and learning events, inside and outside the hospital, which aim at systematically improving the knowledge, skills, and attitudes of the residents. In this sense, theoretical learning includes the demonstration and exercise of practical skills, for example in a simulation session. As stated before (see section1), it is, however, typical for postgraduate medical education in Germany that this theoretical foundation is almost completely absent during the entire PGE process. A curriculum describing the learning objectives, the educational settings, and the methods for evaluating the residents&#8217; progress usually does not exist. See section 4 for a more specific discussion of the causes and consequences of this situation.The KarMed survey also revealed considerable weaknesses in the theoretical underpinning of PGE programs, especially in hospitals with fewer than 800 beds. Just under half (females 44%, males 47%) of the respondents stated that they received feedback on the state of their theoretical knowledge, and only one quarter (24%) reported to be occasionally instructed to improve their knowledge. Female physicians reported significantly less frequently (20%) than males (34%) to have learned to apply the results of scientific studies (p=0.029). As a result, the mean values of the responses from the residents regarding the learning conditions for theory (Likert scale, minimum=1, maximum=5, scale mean=3) were very negative (see Table 2 (Tab. 2)).Since the chambers assign so little importance to the theoretical component, there are few surveys in which the theoretical component of PGE is investigated (see section 3.2.5).The contribution of the hospitals to the theoretical foundation of PGE is, in effect, restricted to short, in-house conferences that take place, on average, once a month. The quality of these sessions depends to a large extent on the academic and didactic qualifications of the individual mentors, and is thus largely unpredictable. Interviewees in the KarMed survey reported an average of one hour per week of in-house training in the first year of training (see Table 3 (Tab. 3)). According to the German Professional Association of Surgeons in 2009, 39% of surgical residents reported participating in a maximum of four sessions lasting one to two hours per year [25]. Participants in the KarMed study reported the following figures for different theory-related learning methods in the first year of residency (see Table 3 (Tab. 3)):Even generously assuming that each resident may employ all of the four learning methods presented above, the result would be a theory-related volume of four hours per week, during the year with arguably the largest demands for learning. Also, when the residents were asked which journals they most frequently read, the classical scientific journals of medicine (British Medical Journal, New England Journal of Medicine, Lancet, etc.) were hardly mentioned.\n3.2.4. The global appraisal of PGE by residents\nIn view of the results presented so far, it is not surprising that the majority of the studies assessing the opinions of residents on their PGE have shown negative opinions. In the KarMed study, less than half of the respondents (42%) agreed with the statement that \"providing a good education is an important goal of our department / hospital\", and only half of the respondents (52%) approved the statement, \"I would recommend my department/clinic to younger colleagues with regard to the quality of their training\". Other studies &#8211; none of which, unfortunately, differed according to gender &#8211; came to comparable or often even more critical results [http://www.marburger-bund.de/projekte/mitgliederbefragung/2014], [http://www.yumpu.com/de/document/view/7436730/online-blitzumfrage-der-dgim-zeigt-erhebliche-defizite-im-bereich], [22], [25], [27], [28]. In conclusion, according to these studies, between 25% and 60% of the residents showed a positive attitude towards their PGE. \n3.2.5. The minimization of PGE deficits by the chambers\nIt should be noted positively that the Federal Chamber investigated the opinions of the residents on the quality of PGE by means of nationwide, standardized surveys in 2009 and 2011 [http://www.bundesaerztekammer.de/fileadmin/user_upload/downloads/EVA_Bundesrapport_final_16042010.pdf], [http://www.bundesaerztekammer.de/fileadmin/user_upload/downloads/BAeK_Ground4.pdf]. The Federal Chamber rated the overall results for 2009 as a solid \"B-\", elsewhere as \"good\", and the comparable results in 2011 as \"relatively good\". According to the Federal Chamber, the overall average of 2.54 on a six-point scale (score scale 1=very positive, 6=very negative; scale middle=3.5) \"reflects the basic satisfaction (of the residents) with the situation of PGE in Germany&#8221;. It was overlooked that results in the positive range of the scale (1-3.4) were often due to the very positive results of PGE for general practice, whereas the hospital disciplines often received negative ratings. This was especially the case for the application of evidence based medicine (EBM). Here, significant negative values (>3.5) were found for all major clinical disciplines (e.g. 4.0 for obstetrics and gynaecology, as well as for paediatrics).\n4. Discussion: The causes of the misery\n\n4.1. Non-intervention as a management principle\nThe data in section 3.2.2 show that the official instruments for documentation and evaluation of the residents&#8217; progress are not regularly utilised by the mentors. Since these logbook documents must be submitted with the signatures of the mentor(s) for admission to the final examination, these interventions seem to be documented after the fact, at the end of the program, rather than annually, in the course of the training. One should bear in mind that these documents constitute official administrative records under public law. The chambers do not publicly criticize these practices or take action against them. Also, there are no criteria for the &#8220;structured training scheme&#8221; to be delivered to the residents at onset. In practice, these schemes consist of a short timetable describing the order in which the resident is to pass through the units of the department (for example, \"intensive care unit in the 3rd semester\"). The fact that such a scheme is often referred to as the \"curriculum\" shows the chambers&#8217; deficits in educational matters. \n4.2. Gender-specific inequalities\nThe conditions of postgraduate education, as laid down in the Federal Chamber regulations and put into practice by the hospitals, can be regarded as man-made directives for men who have a female partner at home to support them. The KarMed study provides plentiful evidence that female physicians have to cope with greater problems than their male counterparts from the beginning of postgraduate training. A female physician who has no children yet is considered to be a \"pregnancy risk\", something that is often openly addressed during the application process, although it is legally forbidden [12], [15]. As a consequence, chief physicians give less appreciation to applications from female doctors. \"Climatic\" forms of discrimination by male physicians in daily work are often reported. The professional problems of female doctors increase substantially when they have children [12], [13], [16]. For the most part, having children results in a transition to part-time work and a lower availability in the hospital, and, subsequently, to fewer career opportunities, an extension of the length of training, and, often, an interruption or discontinuation of the residency. This is associated with differences in endorsement and promotion between male and female residents by mentors, as described in sections 2.3.2 and 2.3.3. Female residents currently constitute two-thirds of all trainees, twice the percentage of 20 years ago [29]. There is an urgent need to develop residency concepts more adapted to the private conditions of female residents and to promote professional cultures that value the work of female physicians who have children. Otherwise, the future supply of physicians in certain areas of medicine, such as the surgical disciplines, may become insufficient in German hospitals.\n4.3. Evaluation deficits\nIt is implicitly assumed in German PGE that a several years of working in a hospital, within an otherwise unstructured teaching and learning environment, somehow automatically guarantees the necessary competencies of a specialist physician. However, a number of years employed in a hospital need not necessarily coincide with the required qualification. The only examination in the course of residency is structured to take thirty minutes and is not considered to be an examination but rather a &#8220;discussion among colleagues&#8221; (&#8220;Fachgespr&#228;ch&#8221;). A 30-minute conversation appears to be an audacious approach to validly examining the competencies of a young specialist. The same problem arises in the course of training: How can the mentor intervene and promote the professional development of the resident if his or her knowledge, skills, and attitudes are not pursued in a systematic manner? A variety of knowledge and skill tests have been developed in other countries, but these are neither recognized nor applied in German PGE [30], [31], [32], [33], [http://www.gmc-uk.org/education/27394.asp].\n4.4. \"Ultimately\", postgraduate training is not education\nAll assistant positions are fully accounted for in the hospitals&#8217; budgets. Time equivalents for teaching and/or learning are not provided, and rewards for quality teaching and learning do not exist. The specifications for training are stated as minimal requirements, thus shifting the obligation to fulfil the requirements exclusively to the trainee. As a result, the core elements of any structured educational process &#8211; the definition of teaching and learning objectives based on professionally required competency profiles, the description of corresponding learning settings, and the construction of valid progress and outcome evaluation procedures, all three elements linked to each other in a \"constructive alignment\" [32], [34] &#8211; are completely lacking in the chamber regulations.The deficits of postgraduate education due to the primacy of hospital work are well known. J&#246;rg Ansorg, chief manager of the Federation of German Surgeons, described the problem as follows: \"It is less the regulation framework that is insufficient, and more the faulty implementation in the hospitals and the non-existing sanctions by the chambers\" [35]. In 2012, prominent professors in anaesthesiology concluded that \"all the available results (indicate) [...] that PGE in Germany does not meet the high national demands for quality of care, patient safety, and the future viability of medical practice\" [24].The interest in an effective medical workforce is supported by what is most likely a mutual disinterest in theory and examinations. This is well illustrated by the low value placed on evidence based medicine (EBM) in actual postgraduate training, as described in the next section\n4.5. The theory deficit: \u201cEminence\u201d based medicine?\nPostgraduate training takes place in a rapidly developing world of medical knowledge, which necessitates reflection and self-evaluation of one&#8217;s own practice in order to assure both patient safety and the optimal allocation of resources. Evidence based medicine demands clinical action to be based on scientifically verified diagnostic and treatment concepts. The opinion became increasingly widespread that medical decisions based on traditions or the opinions of the medical leaders - ironically referred to as \"eminence based medicine&#8221; &#8211; should be replaced by empirical evidence to the greatest extent possible.The EBM principle is the opposite of learning by imitation and the transmission of local treatment concepts and procedures to the resident. The aim of EBM, however, is not to replace clinical experience with rigid guidelines [35], but to combine the application of established knowledge with the best clinical experience for the benefit of the individual patient [36], [37]. Central instruments of a future PGE that are based on an approach to EBM that is understood in this manner include the availability of information systems (such as guideline banks, Cochrane review database), the ability to retrieve such information, the routines to use them in daily care, and the development of adequate learning settings (such as interdisciplinary case conferences, mortality conferences, error reporting systems and the &#8220;good old&#8221; autopsy rounds). The performance and critical discussion of literature reviews, clinical studies, and individual clinical cases in group sessions and seminars [38], [http://www.bundesaerztekammer.de/fileadmin/user_upload/downloads/CurrEBM.pdf] are essential for residents to acquire the corresponding skills. The reality of German PGE is the contrary: The absence of EBM in German PGE was the most prominent complaint expressed by residents in the evaluative surveys of the Federal Chamber in 2009 and 2011 [http://www.bundesaerztekammer.de/fileadmin/user_upload/downloads/EVA_Bundesrapport_final_16042010.pdf], [http://www.bundesaerztekammer.de/fileadmin/user_upload/downloads/BAeK_Ground4.pdf]. Furthermore, a recent survey among all institutions responsible for UGE or PGE showed an &#8220;undersupply of training opportunities in EBM [...] in the all German-speaking countries, in particular in postgraduate and continuing education\" [39].\n5. Conclusion\nThe problems of PGE described here can only be solved by a better integration of undergraduate and postgraduate medical education. Such integration would view UGE and PGE as two phases of a single qualification process, and each would be provided with adequate proportions of theory and practice on the basis of the competency profiles of the individual medical disciplines [40].In an international comparison, the German concept of PGE appears to be far behind modern OECD countries in PGE matters. The possibility that graduates of German PGE might face recognition difficulties in other countries in the future cannot be ruled out. The same applies to the recognition of training institutions according to the criteria of foreign agencies [https://www.acgme.org/acgmeweb/].The results of this study show the need for further systematic investigations on the quality of PGE in Germany. At the same time, the results presented here should already be enough to stimulate the responsible institutions &#8211; the Chambers of Physicians, the specialist associations, and even the health ministries &#8211; to achieve sustainable reforms in German PGE in the sense of a truly structured education that is clearly founded in evidence based medicine and that implements measures for quality assurance.Furthermore, in spite of its complexity, we see a need for international comparisons of process and outcome quality of different PGT concepts. \nFunding\nThe KarMed-study was supported by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research and the European Social Fund in the years 2008 till 2014 (grant numbers 01FP0803 and 01FP0804).

Current clinical data are primarily limited to adults with treatment-resistant NS. Largely unknown to today&#8217;s clinicians is the existence of early clinical studies, following ACTH&#8217;s introduction in the late 1940s, showing sustained proteinuria response in idiopathic NS in predominantly pediatric, treatment-na&#239;ve patients. Before ACTH, patients suffered severe edema and high mortality rates with no reliable or safe treatment. ACTH dramatically altered NS management, initially through recognition of diuresis effects and then through sustained proteinuria remission. This review synthesizes early clinical literature to inform current NS patient management. We undertook a MEDLINE search using MeSH terms &#8220;adrenocorticotropic hormone&#8221; and &#8220;nephrotic syndrome,&#8221; with limits 1945&#8211;1965 and English. Sixty papers totaling 1137 patients were found; 14 studies (9 short-term, five long-term, N&#160;=&#160;419 patients) met inclusion criteria. Studies were divided into two groups: short-term (&#8804;28&#160;days) and long-term (>5&#160;weeks; short-term initial daily treatment followed by long-term intermittent)ACTH therapy and results were aggregated. An initial response, defined as a diuresis, occurred in 74&#160;% of patients/treatment courses across nine short-term ACTH studies. Analyzed in eight of these studies, proteinuria response occurred in 56&#160;% of patients/treatment courses. Across five long-term ACTH studies, proteinuria response was shown in 71&#160;% of patients and was sustained up to 4.7&#160;years following treatment. The inventory and re-evaluation of early clinical data broadens the evidence base of clinical experiences with ACTH for implementation of current treatment strategies and aiding the design of future studies.Electronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s40620-016-0308-3) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.", "body": "Introduction\nAdrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) re-emerged over the last decade as a treatment for nephrotic syndrome (NS) following studies in Europe and the United States. Proteinuria reduction was shown using a synthetic ACTH intramuscular depot formulation (tetracosactide), available in Europe but not the US [1, 2]. Later, a randomized, controlled trial compared treatment with this compound administered twice weekly for 1&#160;year to alternating months of methylprednisolone and cyclophosphamide or chlorambucil for 6&#160;months (the Ponticelli regimen).\nThis study showed comparable high remission rates in patients with idiopathic membranous nephropathy with both treatments [3]. More recently, the pituitary extract-derived compound H.P. Acthar&#174; Gel (repository corticotropin injection; Mallinckrodt ARD Inc., Hazelwood, MO) has significantly reduced proteinuria in some patients with NS with a variety of histologic patterns [4&#8211;9]. These reports studied relatively small, heterogeneous patient groups for limited time periods and most patients had treatment-resistant NS prior to initiation of Acthar Gel. Almost all the subjects were adults with either membranous nephropathy or focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Thus, current clinical data examining ACTH treatment of NS are very limited, especially in pediatric patients.The early ACTH clinical studies are largely unknown to today&#8217;s practicing clinician. Yet, the majority of clinical studies that evaluated ACTH treatment for NS were conducted in the 1950s using a compound purified from pituitary extract. These early studies evaluated predominantly pediatric, treatment-na&#239;ve patients with idiopathic NS who likely would have been diagnosed with minimal change disease (MCD). Prior to the emergence of ACTH in the late 1940s, there was no reliable treatment that provided symptom relief or remission. Patients suffered from generalized, severe edema that could remain for months, often resulting in semi-incapacity to complete disability. They were extremely vulnerable to infection and the mortality rate was as high as 40&#8211;71&#160;% within approximately 4&#8211;5&#160;years of NS onset [10&#8211;12]. Treatments, such as intentional infection with measles or malaria, infusion of concentrated serum albumin, nitrogen mustard and mercurial diuretics yielded variable results and were associated with significant risks [13&#8211;16].The introduction of ACTH (purified from a pituitary extract) dramatically altered NS management, initially most visibly by providing relief from gross edema through diuresis and then with longer treatment courses enabling sustained proteinuria remission [14, 17]. Prolonged, intensive ACTH or steroid therapy improved survival compared to historical control patients; the mortality rate declined to approximately 20&#8211;23&#160;% [11, 12, 18]. The initial ACTH investigations across a broad range of diseases, including NS, are described in the Proceedings of the First Clinical ACTH Conference, held in 1949 in Chicago [19, 20]. Studies examining ACTH therapy for NS were published throughout the 1950s, including case studies and large patient cohorts [10, 13&#8211;17, 21&#8211;40]. ACTH was largely replaced with the synthetic oral steroid prednisone in the 1960s due to its greater ease of administration and more reliable availability [10]. No comparative effectiveness clinical trials were ever conducted. Additionally, at that time the possible differing mechanisms of action between ACTH and steroids or that ACTH may have steroid-independent pathways were not understood. Treatment of infantile spasms (IS) was an exception to the shift toward steroid treatment. Neurologists continued to use ACTH as a primary treatment for IS since the initial 1958 report by Sorel and Dusaucy-Bauloye [41].A critical need remains for effective treatment for patients with NS who are not responsive to the standard regimen of orally administered steroid without the renal and extra-renal toxicities often associated with chronic use of current therapies [42]. Analysis of the early clinical studies addresses an important need in expanding clinical experience and understanding ACTH treatment in NS. The aim of the current retrospective review and analysis is to broaden the evidence base underlying implementation of current ACTH therapy and aid in the design of future robust studies. The current systematic review examines the largest patient population receiving ACTH treatment available to date and examines three periods within the clinical development of ACTH treatment. First, the effects of short-term, daily ACTH on diuresis with edema resolution, the clinical response focus when ACTH was first introduced, were examined. This initial treatment response led early investigators to hypothesize that ACTH was a diuretic. Second, following the realization that ACTH had an important treatment role beyond diuresis, the focus shifted to the effects of short-term ACTH on proteinuria. Third, studies evaluated the effects of long-term intermittent ACTH therapy on sustained proteinuria response.\nMethods\nMEDLINE was searched using the MeSH terms &#8220;adrenocorticotropic hormone&#8221; and &#8220;nephrotic syndrome,&#8221; with the limits 1945 (era of ACTH introduction) to 1965 (ACTH was largely replaced by synthetic oral steroids by this time) and English. Studies also were selected from reference lists of reviewed papers and author K.V.L.&#8217;s historical collection. Study selection is shown in Fig.&#160;1. In studies that examined ACTH and steroid treatment, only ACTH-related data were considered. Studies that focused on acute glomerulonephritis with gross hematuria were excluded. When multiple papers used overlapping patient groups, only one was included.Fig.&#160;1Identification and selection of early clinical ACTH studies. aThe complete list of the 60 articles assessed for eligibility is available in the on-line table. ACTH adrenocorticotropic hormone\nInclusion criteria included:&#160;>5 patients treated; reporting on the clinical response of diuresis and edema resolution; proteinuria (defined quantitatively or semi-quantitatively); and tolerability. Outcomes were tabulated using counts and percentages. Seven of the nine short-term studies and all five long-term studies reported treatment outcomes by number of patients. Two short-term studies reported outcomes by number of treatment courses. The aggregation of proteinuria response and diuresis data among short-term studies combined the number of patients from seven studies and the number of treatment courses from ywo studies. Tolerability was characterized descriptively. Short-term treatments were defined as daily ACTH for&#160;&#8804;4&#160;weeks. Long-term treatments had an initial daily induction regimen followed by intermittent dosing schedules for&#160;&#8805;5&#160;weeks beyond the initial treatment course.\nResults\nSixty papers with 1137 patients were identified (on-line Table). Inclusion/exclusion criteria were met by 14 studies that included 419 patients. Nine studies with 330 patients examined clinical responses (diuresis with edema resolution) to short-term ACTH. Eight of these studies included data on proteinuria response in 225 patients. Five studies with 89 patients reported sustained proteinuria response with long-term treatment. The patients were predominantly pediatric (88&#160;%; 341/388 with ages given) with age&#160;&#8804;20&#160;years [10, 13, 14, 17, 31&#8211;40]. Report of proteinuria response was semi-quantitative, including marked reduction, absence or trace level, within normal limits and 1+ level.\nShort-term ACTH therapy\nShort-term ACTH treatment results for diuresis response and proteinuria are summarized in Table&#160;1 [10, 14, 31&#8211;37]. ACTH dose ranged from 20&#160;mg/day to 160&#160;mg/day, with one protocol using the regimen of 150&#8211;200&#160;mg/m2/day [35]. Mean treatment duration for a single treatment course was approximately 12&#160;days, ranging 4&#8211;28&#160;days. Patients who relapsed following cessation of short-term treatment or who did not respond adequately often received additional short-term ACTH courses [10, 14, 31&#8211;36].Table&#160;1Proteinuria and diuresis response during short-term ACTH therapy for nephrotic syndromeStudyNAge (n)ACTH regimenDose and durationDiuresis responseN (%)Proteinuria responseN (%)Response durationN (%)Luetscher [34]14&#8804;10 (7)16 (1)&#8805;22 (6)25&#8211;100&#160;mg/d9&#8211;14&#160;d10 (71)11/14 (79) response4/14 (29) absence3/10 (30) up to 10&#160;moi\n7/10 (70)&#160;&#8804;4&#160;moi\nRapoport [36]34<8 (34)40&#8211;150&#160;mg/d8&#8211;12&#160;d28 (82)12/12e (100) response13/28 (72) up to 18&#160;moi\nKramer [14]12&#8804;18 (12)50&#8211;100&#160;mg/d up to 125&#160;mg/d8&#8211;13&#160;d9 (75)9/12 (75) absence/trace1/12 (8) 12&#160;moj\n7/12 (58) 1&#8211;9&#160;moj\nMetcoff [35]45<12 (45)150&#8211;200&#160;mg/m2/d8&#8211;10&#160;d34 (75)3/12f (25) responseNARiley [37]50<18 (49)60&#160;mg/d (age&#160;&#160;9)10&#160;d41/63c (65)NA111/140 (79)&#160;&#8804;3&#160;moi,k\nRance [10]88&#8804;18 (88)20&#8211;50&#160;mg/db\n4&#8211;28&#160;d75/109c (69)44/109g (40) absence25/33h (76) absenceNABaskin [31]18&#8804;18 (18)50&#8211;100&#160;U/d7&#8211;14&#160;d15 (83)17/18 (94) response7/18 (41) absenceNACharlton [32]38&#8804;10 (21)11&#8211;20 (8)&#8805;21 (9)20&#8211;160&#160;mg/d4&#8211;23&#160;d25/30d (83)22/38 (58) absence12/22 (54)&#8805;12&#160;moj\nEales [33]31Range&#160;2&#160;yrj\nTotal patients showing responseN (%)265/356 (74)156/279 (56)\nACTH adrenocorticotropic hormone, d day(s), mo month(s), NA not available, yr&#160;year(s)\naAge was not specified for the subset of patients who received ACTH treatment\nb1 or more patients received one or more courses of ACTH treatment by intravenous infusion\ncPercentage of ACTH treatment courses\nd30/38 patients presented with edema\ne12/34 patients had assessment of proteinuria\nf12/45 patients completed proteinuria assessment pre- and post-ACTH therapy\ngNumber of courses with edema present pre-treatment\nhNumber of courses without edema at pre-treatment\niDiuresis with edema resolution response duration\njProteinuria response duration\nkTreatment courses included ACTH and/or cortisone\nDiuresis with edema resolution was the key clinical outcome in the earliest studies of short-term ACTH and ACTH dose was quickly tapered or discontinued following diuresis onset [14, 37]. The nine short-term ACTH treatment studies reported diuresis with edema resolution in 74&#160;% (265/356) of patients/treatment courses [14, 31&#8211;36]. Compared with the six short-term ACTH studies showing diuresis in&#160;&#8805;75&#160;% of patients, the three studies that reported diuresis in&#160;<75&#160;% of patients had shorter treatment duration, courses of 4&#8211;6&#160;days, or lower ACTH dosage, 20&#8211;25&#160;mg/day (Table&#160;1). Onset of diuresis occurred either during or within a few days following the cessation of ACTH treatment. Diuresis was usually temporary, with the majority of patients relapsing within 1&#160;month [33].The eight short-term ACTH treatment studies that reported proteinuria showed a proteinuria response in 56&#160;% (156/279) of patients/treatment courses. Using the more restrictive definition of proteinuria absence, 50&#160;% (139/279) of patients/treatment courses showed a proteinuria response. The duration of treatment effects on proteinuria were described as transient for the majority of patients, lasting a few days to a few months following ACTH cessation, or were not examined [10, 14, 31, 33&#8211;35]. A study at the upper end for treatment duration (up to 21&#160;days) and ACTH dose (160&#160;mg/day) found 12/22 (54&#160;%) patients who had shown proteinuria absence following&#160;&#8805;1 courses of ACTH had sustained proteinuria remission at their&#160;&#8805;12&#160;month post-treatment assessment [32].\nLong-term ACTH therapy\nLong-term ACTH treatment results are summarized in Table&#160;2 [13, 17, 38&#8211;40]. All regimens included an initial short-term daily ACTH treatment course. The ACTH intermittent regimen doses ranged from 100 to 200&#160;mg/day, with the exception of one protocol that used 1&#160;mg/lb/day [40]. The regimens of four studies included intermittent ACTH treatment for three consecutive days repeated weekly for up to 24&#160;months. One study used long-term daily ACTH treatment for up to 19&#160;months as maintenance therapy [38]. In the remaining study, the initial ACTH treatment course was followed by daily ACTH treatment at 1&#160;mg/lb/day until absence of albuminuria for 1&#8211;2&#160;weeks [40]. Treatment then shifted to an intermittent, every-other-day regimen with ACTH increased to 1.2&#160;mg/lb/day if no response was shown by 3&#160;weeks, followed by reduction in ACTH dose over several weeks. In this treatment protocol, if albuminuria increased during the intermittent regimen, the dose or frequency of ACTH was doubled or increased to the initial treatment dose.Table&#160;2Proteinuria response to long-term ACTH therapy for nephrotic syndromeStudyNAge (n)Initial course and maintenanceACTH regimensDose and durationProteinuria response during ACTH treatmentN (%)/durationProteinuria responsePost-ACTH treatmentN (%)/durationLange [39]6&#8804;18 (6)\nInitial course\n100&#160;mg/d for 7&#160;d\nMaintenance therapy\n100&#160;mg/d for three consecutive d, repeated weekly for 5&#8211;8&#160;wk6/6 (100)/5&#8211;8&#160;wk5/6 (83)/6&#8211;26&#160;moMerrill [40]25&#8804;12 (25)\nInitial course\n1&#160;mg/lb/d for 10 d\nMaintenance therapy\n1&#160;mg/lb/d until stable response, continued 2&#160;wk to 3&#160;mo&#160;If no response after 3&#160;wk, ACTH dose increased, given every other day, continued 2&#160;wk to 17&#160;mo&#160;Minimum 4&#160;mo maintenance treatment with decreasing dose tapered to 1&#160;mg/lb/d twice weekly for several wk&#160;If relapse (defined as 2+ to 4+ albuminuria), dose or frequency doubled&#160;If proteinuria not diminished within 48&#160;h of relapse, ACTH dose increased to initial level23/25 (92)/&#8804;25&#160;mo14/25 (56)/1&#160;wk&#8211;18&#160;moDurand [13]11&#8804;18 (11)\nInitial course\n100&#160;mg/d age&#160;&#8804;&#160;6; 150&#8211;200&#160;mg/d age&#160;>6&#160;average 8&#160;d\nMaintenance therapy\nInitial course regimen repeated with 3- to 4-d no-treatment intervals &#8220;until stable response&#8221;11/11 (100)/NANAMateer [17]9&#8804;13 (9)\nInitial course\n100&#8211;200&#160;mg/d for 28&#160;d\nMaintenance therapy\n100&#160;mg, three times per week, repeated weekly9/9 (100)/&#8805;&#160;12 moa\nNAa\nDanowski [38]38&#8804;20 (7)>20 to&#160;&#8804;69 (31)\nInitial course\n50&#8211;500&#160;U daily, typically 200&#160;U/d for&#160;&#8805;28 d\nMaintenance therapy\n200&#160;U daily for three consecutive d, repeated weekly for 2 to 24&#160;mo or daily ACTH up to 19&#160;mo14/38 (37)/1 mo to 4.7&#160;yra\nNAa\nTotal patients showing proteinuria response, N (%)63/89 (71)19/31 (61)Total patients duration of treatment/follow-up, range1&#160;mo&#8211;4.7&#160;yr\nACTH adrenocorticotropic hormone, d day(s), lb pounds, mo month(s), NA not available, yr&#160;year(s)\naInsufficient study detail to determine the period on long-term ACTH treatment versus post-treatment during sustained proteinuria\nSustained proteinuria response was examined in the five long-term studies. Evaluation of proteinuria response during long-term ACTH or combined long-term ACTH and post-treatment follow-up showed proteinuria response in 71&#160;% (63/89) of patients [13, 17, 38, 40]. The two studies that reported proteinuria response post-treatment showed 61&#160;% (19/31) of patients had sustained proteinuria response for up to 26&#160;months [39, 40].Patient follow-up ranged from 1&#160;month to 4.7&#160;years [13, 17, 38&#8211;40]. In a study of 25 patients, sustained proteinuria response following ACTH cessation was shown in 14 patients for a mean of 9.6&#160;months and another nine patients showed continued proteinuria response during their ongoing ACTH intermittent regimen [40]. A study of 38 patients, primarily adults, found proteinuria response in 18 (47&#160;%) patients following the initial course of ACTH. Twelve (67&#160;%) of these patients showed sustained proteinuria response during the long-term ACTH regimen or post-ACTH treatment for up to 4.7&#160;years [38]. An additional two patients who did not show proteinuria response following the initial ACTH course did show proteinuria response after long-term (13 and 14&#160;months) intermittent ACTH treatment at the 1- and 3-year evaluations. Following 5&#8211;8&#160;weeks of an intermittent ACTH regimen, 5/6 (83&#160;%) patients showed sustained proteinuria response at 6&#8211;26&#160;months following ACTH cessation [39]. Two studies reported 9/9 and 11/11 patients showed sustained proteinuria response following long-term ACTH without providing the specific treatment duration versus post-treatment assessment [13, 17].\nTolerability\nThe early clinical studies noted a worsening of edema at initiation of ACTH therapy, prior to diuresis [32&#8211;34]. Although not yet well known at the time, we can now conclude that the worsening of edema was likely due to fluid retaining effects via the steroidogenic effects of ACTH. Side effects associated with hyperadrenocorticism, including characteristics of Cushing&#8217;s syndrome, were described during short-term, high-dose (ranging from 100 to 160&#160;mg/day) daily ACTH treatment, but resolved following ACTH cessation [14, 32, 33, 36]. Additionally, freckling was reported in nearly all patients in one study [17]. Long-term intermittent ACTH treatment studies described less pronounced hyperadrenocorticism side effects [17, 38, 40].\nDiscussion\nACTH transformed the treatment of patients with NS in the late 1940s through the 1950s. There was a dramatic drop in mortality from as high as 40&#8211;71&#160;% before the introduction of ACTH to 23 to 25&#160;% by 1958 [11, 12, 18]. Following the first clinical use of ACTH in NS by Edith Farnsworth in 1948, short-term ACTH regimens with daily high-dose treatment targeted at diuresis were introduced to bring relief and improve quality of life in greatly suffering edematous patients [19, 20].In the current examination of the early clinical literature, 74&#160;% of patients achieved a diuresis in response to one or more short-term ACTH courses. However, proteinuria completely resolved in only 54&#160;% of the historical patients who received short-term treatment. This lower response rate as compared with current regimens is likely due to the briefer treatment course. The brevity of the diuresis and the variable effect on proteinuria led some early investigators to consider ACTH a diuretic without effect on the core pathophysiologic alterations of NS. A report from the International Study of Kidney Diseases in Children (ISKDC) described time to response (here defined as proteinuria resolution) for patients with MCD treated with prednisone [43]. A similar response rate was seen in patients treated with prednisone for 1&#8211;2&#160;weeks as was seen in the short-term ACTH experience. In the short-term ACTH studies, a dose&#8211;response association was recognized. Examination of patient outcomes relative to treatment duration showed that treatment <8&#160;days was ineffective whereas 83&#160;% of patients showed loss of edema, proteinuria or both when treatment was&#160;&#8805;18&#160;days [10]. Similarly, it was stated that the proteinuria response was more pronounced with 4&#160;weeks as compared to 1&#8211;2&#160;weeks of treatment [17].A key goal of long-term ACTH treatment was to induce a proteinuria response in patients who had not responded to short-term therapy, in modern terms to overcome steroid resistance, and the long-term studies showed a greater percentage of patients achieving proteinuria remission [38]. These early findings are consistent with modern treatment regimens using longer-term administration schedules. Some patients who were resistant when treated short-term then responded to a longer treatment regimen. That the proteinuria response rate of 54&#160;% in short-term studies improved to 71&#160;% during long-term treatment supports an important modern treatment indication for ACTH in patients who are steroid resistant.The transient proteinuria response during the early short-term clinical trials also led some clinical researchers to consider whether longer ACTH treatment could modify the course of NS and produce a sustained proteinuria remission [31]. ACTH regimens evolved to longer duration of continuous treatment; repeated intermittent treatment cycles with short intervals of no treatment; and the inclusion of additional ACTH courses in patients who had already achieved a diuresis [13, 32, 44&#8211;46]. Barnett and colleagues hypothesized in 1954 that proteinuria in patients with NS was due to increased permeability of the glomerular capillary wall to proteins such as albumin [21]. Following an ACTH treatment study in 10 children with NS in which glomerular filtration was also serially evaluated, Barnett and colleagues concluded that the primary effect of ACTH treatment is the shift toward normal of glomerular permeability to albumin and other plasma proteins.Long-term intermittent regimens treated patients with ACTH from 5&#160;weeks to 2&#160;years beyond the initial short-term daily ACTH regimen with follow-up of patient outcomes up to 4&#160;years post-ACTH therapy [13, 17, 38&#8211;40]. In the current examination of the early clinical studies, the long-term study that primarily examined adults showed 37&#160;% were maintained in long-term remissions during ACTH treatment and/or post-treatment up to 4.7&#160;years [38]. Among the four long-term studies that included children, &#8805;92&#160;% of patients were maintained in remissions during ACTH treatment [13, 17, 39, 40]. In one study, 83&#160;% of patients showed sustained proteinuria response up to 26&#160;months post-treatment and in another study, 56&#160;% of patients showed sustained proteinuria response up to 18&#160;months post-treatment [39, 40]. The high rate of sustained remissions in children receiving longer duration formulation ACTH treatment supports the use of ACTH therapy in patients who are steroid dependent (SD) or frequently relapsing (FR), two important modern treatment needs.The multinational, collaborative work of the ISKDC during the 1970s resulted in histopathologic classification (utilizing the newly introduced technique of percutaneous kidney biopsy) and the clinical characterization system based on steroid response. The current review found 71&#160;% of patients achieved proteinuria response with long-term intermittent ACTH treatment, which is consistent with later reports of response rates with longer-term steroid treatment [43]. Patients included in long-term ACTH treatment to maintain proteinuria remission would fit later definitions of SD, steroid resistant (SR) and FR. In one long-term study, patients who experienced&#160;&#8805;1 exacerbations were placed on intermittent or continuous ACTH therapy [17]. Among 34 exacerbations, 18 patients were re-treated 1&#8211;6 times and the proteinuria response to retreatment with ACTH was comparable to the initial treatment response [17]. In another long-term study, continuous treatment was initiated in patients who relapsed following the initial treatment course [40]. Among the 12 patients, there was an average of four failed intermittent treatment courses before continuous treatment was implemented, resulting in sustained remissions [40].Different ACTH formulations, and purification and standardization protocols during the 1950s (with the potential for impurities) likely led to more variability in patient outcomes and side effects than would be expected with the currently available, FDA approved, highly purified Acthar Gel formulation. Of the eight studies that reported their ACTH source, four named Armour Laboratories (a precursor of Acthar HP gel in the literature) [34&#8211;36, 39], two stated the National Drug Company [17, 38], and one each identified the Medical Research Council [32] and Connaught Laboratories/Nordic Biochemicals Limited [10]. Comparison of dosages is also problematic. In some cases, the active ingredient was quantified in mg or mcg/mL, whereas in other products it was characterized by biologic potency or activity in U/mL. Acthar Gel is approved by the FDA based on potency (U/mL). Although it is possible to qualitatively compare efficacy of Acthar Gel (dosed in U/mL) with that of historical ACTH preparations (dosed in mg or mcg/mL) in a given indication, it is not possible to quantitatively compare the specific dosing regimens.These early clinical studies focused primarily on children. The most common diagnosis in current nosology was likely MCD, as indicated by the high percent of prompt remissions that were observed. Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis was probably present in some patients with short-term treatment resistance. Current clinical studies examining ACTH treatment in children with NS are scarce, yet the early clinical literature suggests ACTH may be very beneficial for these patients [47]. Additional effective, tolerable treatment options are of particular need among children with NS who are nonresponsive to or unable to tolerate steroid or other first- or second-line treatments.A central question for today&#8217;s clinicians is which patient subgroups respond to ACTH treatment and what underlies differential responsiveness. One possibility relates to the total cumulative ACTH dose needed for a clinical response and the balance between cumulative dose, treatment duration, and potential side effects in patient subgroups. For example, among patients with idiopathic membranous nephropathy, those receiving greater cumulative dose ACTH gel (2800&#160;U) showed greater proteinuria reduction compared with lower cumulative doses (880 and 1760&#160;U) [7]. Although the early clinical studies did not provide sufficient details to determine cumulative dose, the differences between short-term daily and long-term intermittent ACTH regimens in producing sustained proteinuria response supports that such a balance is important for optimal patient outcomes.One early clinical study noted freckling, a probable melanocyte effect, in nearly all patients, an early indication of a possible non-steroid pathway of action for ACTH [17]. A recent focus in understanding patient responsiveness to ACTH therapy in NS is the mechanism of action of ACTH through the interaction of ACTH with melanocortin receptors (MCRs) and their steroid dependent and independent pathways [48&#8211;50]. Steroid-independent effects may occur through MC1R [51, 52]. ACTH in an animal model of progressive renal tubulointerstitial injury has shown suppression of tubulointerstitial inflammation, tubular atrophy, and fibrosis through anti-inflammatory effects mediated by MC1R on tubular epithelial cells [51]. MC1Rs have been shown in podocytes, glomerular endothelial cells, and mesangial cells, and an MC1R agonist resulted in significantly reduced proteinuria in the passive Heymann nephritis animal model [52]. Such steroid-independent mechanisms of action may provide an explanation for ACTH efficacy in steroid-resistant patients (Fig.&#160;2).Fig.&#160;2Putative mechanisms of action of ACTH in the kidney.

Indexing of published studies was not exhaustive during the 1950s, resulting in some papers being unavailable for review. Some papers used a discussion format and did not provide comprehensive clinical information. Modern nomenclature was not available for patient diagnoses and categorization as there was no clinical classification, such as &#8220;steroid responsive,&#8221; or histological classifications as are used today. Despite the absence of modern terminology, the detailed clinical descriptions in the selected manuscripts enables a useful analysis of this experience. Potential risk of bias in the publication of early clinical studies could not be formally assessed.\nConclusion\nThe potential of ACTH to produce sustained proteinuria response in idiopathic NS was shown at its introduction in the 1950s. This historical experience, which provides the largest population of patients with NS treated with ACTH to date and broadens the evidence base of clinical experience with ACTH, has the following contemporary implications. Daily ACTH can be effectively substituted for daily prednisone for the initial treatment of newly presenting patients with NS as well as for the treatment of relapses in patients already known to be steroid responsive. This approach with ACTH treatment has already been shown to be very useful for patients who are not able to tolerate oral steroid treatment [47]. Patients with chronic gastritis, for whom oral steroid administration is relatively contraindicated, could also benefit from the parenteral administration of ACTH. Determining whether this regimen would result in a higher percentage of treatment responses or more sustained remissions compared with the current standard regimen will require an appropriately powered clinical trial.The historical data suggest a role for ACTH therapy for the more problematic patients with SD, FR and SR patterns. Longer-term intermittent ACTH courses were well tolerated and induced remissions at a higher rate than shorter regimens as well as sustained long-term remissions for many patients. With current regimens, these patients suffer significant cumulative steroid toxicity and are often exposed to the toxicities of intensive immunosuppressive therapies. A clinical trial of ACTH treatment of SD and FR patients is currently recruiting and a clinical trial for the treatment of SR patients is in the final stage of planning. Demonstration of ACTH responsiveness in steroid-resistant children (as demonstrated in adults) would represent a significant advance in therapeutics [4&#8211;7].\nElectronic supplementary material\n\nNone\nBelow is the link to the electronic supplementary material.\nSupplementary material 1 (DOCX 36&#160;kb)\n", "pmid": "27084801", "title": "Adrenocorticotropic hormone therapy for the treatment of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome in children and young adults: a systematic review of early clinical studies with contemporary relevance", "journal_title": "Journal of Nephrology", "authors": "Kenneth V.

Noninvasive molecular biomarkers for triage of high-risk patients for invasive procedures are needed. Based on the success of cytological Pap smear screening, cervical scrapings are a good source of DNA for molecular testing. In addition to genetic lesions, DNA methylation is a promising biomarker. We assessed the usefulness of combining genetic and epigenetic biomarkers from cervical scrapings to detect endometrial carcinomas.Methods\nWe performed a retrospective case&#8211;control study of 96 consecutive cervical scrapings from patients with abnormal uterine bleeding who underwent surgery for diagnostic evaluation. Thirty and 16 cases were diagnosed with type I and type II endometrial cancers, respectively. The remaining non-cancer cases included normal endometrium (n = 12), benign uterine lesions (n = 20), and endometrial hyperplasia (n = 18). Quantitative methylation-specific PCR and mass spectrometry were used for DNA methylation and genetic mutation analysis. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the clinical performance of these candidate biomarkers.Results\nWe tested the effectiveness of the methylation status of four genes (BHLHE22, CDO1, TBX5, and HAND2) in endometrial cancer detection. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves ranged from 0.703 to 0.878, and panels of hypermethylated BHLHE22/CDO1/HAND2 (87.0% sensitivity and 86.0% specificity) and BHLHE22/CDO1/TBX5 (89.1% sensitivity and 80.0% specificity) showed significant differences and could distinguish benign from malignant endometrial lesions. The sensitivity and specificity in endometrial cancer detection for BHLHE22/CDO1 were 84.8% and 88.0%, respectively. Both type I and II endometrial carcinomas could be detected using a BHLHE22/CDO1-based methylation profile, suggesting that they may have common epigenomes. Moreover, PTEN and TP53 mutations were found in 63.3% of type I and 93.6% of type II endometrial cancers. Unexpectedly, PTEN and TP53 mutations were commonly found in cervical scrapings of the normal endometrium (25% and 33.3%, respectively) and in cases with benign uterine lesions (10% and 50%, respectively). Finally, combinations of any one mutation of PTEN and TP53 mutations had a sensitivity of 91.3%, but a specificity of only 42.0%.Conclusions\nAdding PTEN/TP53 mutation testing to BHLHE22/CDO1-based methylation testing did not improve the detection of endometrial cancer.", "body": "Background\nEndometrial cancer (EC) is the most common female genital tract malignancy in developed countries [1]. Although abnormal or dysfunctional uterine bleeding is the most frequent symptom of EC, only 10% of postmenopausal women with this symptom have EC. The most common diagnostic test for EC is transvaginal ultrasound, which measures the thickness of the endometrium. Unfortunately, transvaginal ultrasound cannot reliably distinguish between benign and malignant lesions [2]. Moreover, a cutoff value for an endometrial thickness that warrants further hysteroscopy remains under debate. Thus, invasive procedures to obtain endometrial tissues by fractional dilatation, curettage, and hysteroscopic biopsy remain necessary. However, the chance of diagnosing EC using current methods is low, even in symptomatic patients. Consequently, noninvasive molecular markers with acceptable accuracy for EC screening, at least in symptomatic women, are much needed.The endometrium is a highly proliferative and cyclically regenerative tissue, which makes it vulnerable to genetic and epigenetic changes. While estrogen drives endometrial cell proliferation, progesterone inhibits it and causes cell differentiation. Conditions associated with a functional dominance of estrogen over progesterone increase the risk for both endometrial hyperplasia and EC. EC is broadly classified into two histotypes: type I, which consists of predominantly endometrioid adenocarcinomas, and type II, which incorporates serous-type, clear-cell, and poorly differentiated carcinomas. The proposed hyperplasia-to-carcinoma sequence for type I EC involves unopposed estrogen activity with subsequent mutations or alterations in pro-growth molecular pathways. Moreover, genomic data from The Cancer Genome Atlas defined four molecular subtypes of EC [3]. The four molecularly defined cancer subtypes are: DNA polymerase &#949; exonuclease domain mutation, microsatellite-instable, microsatellite-stable with fewer copy-number alterations (CNAs), and microsatellite-stable (serous-like) with more CNAs. A categorization of ECs into one of these four subgroups could potentially provide individuals with prognostic and predictive information [4].Unfortunately, the application of such genetic information in endometrial screening remains limited. Loss of function of the phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) tumor suppressor heralds the beginning of multistep carcinogenesis, and its somatic mutation and/or deletion is the most common genetic change in endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinoma [5]. PTEN lesions are present in 83% of sporadic EC cases [6] and have been proposed to serve as diagnostic markers for endometrial precancerous lesions [7]. In addition to PTEN, approximately 25% of all ECs have been found to harbor mutations in the tumor suppressor TP53 [8]. Although both PTEN and TP53 drive carcinogenesis in many malignancies, the mechanistic role of both genes in endometrial carcinogenesis has not been fully elucidated [9].A recent investigation revealed the feasibility of testing such genetic mutations in cervical scrapings (&#8220;Pap smears&#8221;) for EC detection [10, 11]. In addition to genetic anomalies, epigenetic alternations are also involved in complex cancer development [12]. Aberrant DNA methylation-associated transcriptional silencing in tumor suppressor genes is commonly observed in human cancers [13]. Two predominantly global methylation patterns in cancer have been generally acknowledged: DNA hypermethylation of specific gene promoters, leading to gene silencing (&#8220;localized hypermethylation&#8221;), and loss of methylation within highly repeated DNA sequences, leading to unstable genomes and aberrant expression of oncogenes (&#8220;global hypomethylation&#8221;). Thus, understanding epigenetic regulation in EC progression may open new avenues for EC detection.In light of the above, epigenetic lesions could potentially serve as early detection biomarkers for EC. For example, an epigenome-wide methylation analysis revealed that Heart and Neural Crest Derivatives Expressed 2 (HAND2) was one of the most commonly hypermethylated and silenced genes in EC [14]. Li and colleagues also demonstrated that HAND2 plays a major role in endometrial stromal-epithelial signaling [15], and that, in the presence of progesterone, endometrial epithelial cell proliferation inhibits HAND2 upregulation in endometrial stroma. Thus, HAND2 methylation is a common and crucial molecular alteration in EC that could hold clinical implications [16, 17]. The feasibility of HAND2 methylation testing in cervical scrapings and its value for EC detection remain undetermined. Our previous comprehensive methylomics approach identified in EC tissues a panel of highly methylated genes, including BHLHE22/CDO1/CELF4, that were detectable in cervical scrapings [18]. Such studies provide proof-of-concept for new means of EC screening using epigenetics analyses.The combination of genetic and epigenetic markers from cervical scrapings for EC detection is logical and appealing. However, to our knowledge, no studies have tested such an approach. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to test whether the use of panels of combined epigenetic and genetic markers derived from cervical scrapings could improve EC detection.\nMethods\n\nClinical samples\nFemale participants (age range, 30&#8211;80&#8201;years) were enrolled in our case&#8211;control retrospective study from November 2015 to September 2017. These women had cervical scrapings performed because of abnormal or dysfunctional uterine bleeding, followed by surgery at the Taipei Medical University-Shuang Ho Hospital, New Taipei City. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Taipei Medical University-Shuang Ho Hospital, in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki 2000 (Protocol no. N201902024). Informed consent was obtained from all participants. Age, histologic type/grade of lesion or tumor, and International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage were extracted from the hospital records. Following collection, cervical scrapings were immediately placed in a RNAlater Stabilization Solution (Ambion, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and stored at &#8722; 80&#8201;&#176;C for future analysis.\nMethylation analysis of \nGenomic DNA was extracted from the cervical scrapings using the QIAmp DNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany), 800&#8201;ng of which was modified with bisulfite using an EZ DNA Methylation Kit (D5008; Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer&#8217;s instructions, and then dissolved in 70&#8201;&#956;L nuclease-free water. PCR products and quantitative methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (qMS-PCR) were performed using a LightCycler 480 SYBR Green I Master (Roche, Penzberg, Germany). Reactions were carried out in 20&#8201;&#956;L containing 2&#8201;&#956;L bisulfite-converted DNA, 250&#8201;nmol/L of each primer, and 10&#8201;&#956;L Master Mix using the following thermal profiles: 95&#8201;&#176;C for 5&#8201;min (initiation), 50&#8201;cycles of 95&#8201;&#176;C for 10&#8201;s, 60&#8201;&#176;C for 30&#8201;s, and 72&#8201;&#176;C for 30&#8201;s (amplification), and a final extension step at 72&#8201;&#176;C for 5&#8201;min. All gene amplifications were conducted using duplicate specimens. To calculate a relative target amount, only the respective crossing point (Cp) values of the target, the reference gene for each sample, and a calibrator need to be determined using LightCycler software. To normalize the input DNA in each methylation-independent assay, we used the amount of a non-CpG region of a type II collagen gene (COL2A1) as internal reference [19]. DNA methylation levels were estimated by the difference in crossing point (&#916;Cp) values using the following formula: Cp of target &#8722; Cp value of COL2A1. We considered and simplified the percentage of methylated reference for each result using the &#916;Cp values for detecting DNA methylation [20, 21]. The analytical sensitivities of candidate genes are shown in Additional file 1: Figure S1. Linear regression analysis was used to assess assay linearity. The serial dilution of COL2A1 showed that the DNA temple was 118 copies; the mean Cp value of COL2A1 was 35.8. Therefore, we defined Cp values of COL2A1 > 36 as not detected for each candidate gene in our samples. BHLHE22-, CDO1-, and TBX5-specific primers were designed using Oligo 7.0 Primer Analysis software (Molecular Biology Insights, Inc.). We used the primer sequences of HAND2 described in a previous study [14].\nSomatic mutation detection and analysis of \nTo identify PTEN and TP53 exomic mutations, we sequenced all exons of those two genes using the Illumina HiSeq2500 high-throughput genome sequencer (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Next, 40&#8201;ng of DNA from each individual was used to construct a DNA library of 43 target regions using the QIAseq targeted DNA system (QIAGEN). Briefly, DNA was enzymatically fragmented and end-repaired in a 25&#8201;&#956;L solution containing 2.5&#8201;&#956;L 10&#215; fragmentation buffer and 5&#8201;&#956;L fragmentation enzyme mix. The reaction was carried out at 4&#8201;&#176;C for 1&#8201;min, 32&#8201;&#176;C for 24&#8201;min, and 65&#8201;&#176;C for 30&#8201;min. Immediately after the reaction, 10&#8201;&#956;L 5&#215; ligation buffer, 5&#8201;&#956;L DNA ligase, 2.8&#8201;&#956;L of 25&#8201;&#956;M&#8201;bar-coded adapters, and water were added for a total volume of 50&#8201;&#956;L. The reaction was then continued at 20&#8201;&#176;C for 15&#8201;min. To ensure the complete removal of free barcoded adapters, each reaction was purified twice using a bead-system (QIAGEN). In a total volume of 20&#8201;&#956;L, purified DNA was mixed with 10&#8201;nM of each target primer, 400&#8201;nM forward primer, 1&#215; PCR buffer, and 0.8&#8201;&#956;L HotStarTaq DNA polymerase. The PCR enrichment conditions were: 95&#8201;&#176;C for 13&#8201;min, 98&#8201;&#176;C for 2&#8201;min, six cycles of 98&#8201;&#176;C for 15&#8201;s, 65&#8201;&#176;C for 15&#8201;min, and 72&#8201;&#176;C for 5&#8201;min. Each reaction mixture was purified to remove unused primers. The enriched DNA was combined with 400&#8201;nM universal primer, 400&#8201;nM index primer, 1&#215; PCR buffer, and 1&#8201;&#956;L HotStarTaq DNA polymerase in a total volume of 20&#8201;&#956;L. The universal PCR conditions were: 95&#8201;&#176;C for 13&#8201;min, 98&#8201;&#176;C for 2&#8201;min; 20&#8201;cycles of 98&#8201;&#176;C for 15&#8201;s, 60&#8201;&#176;C for 2&#8201;min, and 72&#8201;&#176;C for 5&#8201;min. The DNA library was then purified and pooled for sequencing (2 &#215; 100 base pairs [BPs]). The raw output from each individual scraping was > 100&#8201;Mb, with an average target region depth > 30,000&#215;. The sequence of each read was trimmed based on its quality score (Q30), and a length < 45 BPs of each read was discarded from the following analyses. The reads were aligned to the human hg19 reference genome using BWA-MEM (http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/), and variants were called using GATK Unified Genotyper (GATKLite version 2.3&#8211;9) [22]. After variant calling, Variant Effect Predictor (http://grch37.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Tools/VEP) was used to annotate the identified variants. We then selected the confidence of the mutations using alternate allele frequencies &#8805; 0.3 as a cutoff and removed synonymous substitutions (i.e., silent mutations in the encoded protein). All PTEN and TP53 mutations were displayed using MutationMapper software (https://www.cbioportal.org/mutation_mapper), as shown in Fig. 2a [23, 24]. The presence of a major mutation in each individual gene is shown as the maximum value of alternate allele frequencies in Fig. 2b.\nStatistical analysis\nBased on previous work, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) of hypermethylated HAND2 in the normal endometrium vs. EC tissues was 0.9 [14]. Consequently, we assumed that the AUC-ROC of hypermethylated HAND2 in cervical scrapings from normal and type I EC patients was 0.8. The null hypothesis AUC-ROC, type I error (&#945;), and type II error (&#946;) values were 0.5, 0.01, and 0.05, respectively, and the ratio of sample sizes of normal vs. type I EC tissue was 1.0, requiring at least 28 cases in both groups. We then added three samples to both groups to avoid a 10% failure rate in subsequent tests. Additionally, we simultaneously examined gene mutations and DNA methylation levels in DNA isolated from cervical scrapings from patients with endometrial hyperplasia (n = 18) and type II EC (n = 16). The Mann&#8211;Whitney nonparametric U test and the Kruskal&#8211;Wallis test were used to identify significant differences in methylation levels between two categories and more than two categories, respectively. The associations between categorical clinical variables and methylation levels/genetic mutations were identified by the chi-square test for 2-by-2 categories. The combinations of methylated DNA levels were calculated using a logistic regression model, and each gene was weighted by a coefficient value. The cutoff values were evaluated by AUC-ROC analysis with the Youden method. A two-tailed P value &#8804; 0.05 was considered significant.\nResults\n\nHypermethylation of \nTable 1 shows the clinical and pathological features of 96 patients from whom cervical scrapings and subsequent uterine tissue specimens were collected. These included scraped samples of normal endometrium (n = 12), benign diseases (n = 20), endometrial hyperplasia (n = 18), type I EC (n = 30), and type II EC (n = 16). The methylation levels of those four genes, in terms of &#916;Cp values, are displayed as dot plots in Fig. 1a. The lower the &#916;Cp value, the higher the gene&#8217;s methylation status. BHLHE22, CDO1, and HAND2 methylation increased significantly from normal endometrium to endometrial hyperplasia, type I ECs, and type II ECs (P < 0.001) (Fig. 1a). Next, we calculated the AUC-ROCs for these four genes to determine the sensitivity and specificity of methylated DNA for cancer detection in cervical scrapings. The results ranged from 0.703 to 0.878 (Fig. 1b). BHLHE22 performed the best of all tested genes.\nTable 1Demographics of clinical samplesVariablesNormal endometriumBenign diseasesHyperplasiaEndometrial cancer (EC)Type IType IINumber of cases1220183016Age (years)53.4 &#177; 5.646.2 &#177; 5.846.4 &#177; 6.555.3 &#177; 6.959.6 &#177; 8.7Subtypes&#8195;Adenomyosis1 (5%)&#8195;Leiomyoma10 (50%)&#8195;Adenomyosis and leiomyoma9 (45%)&#8195;Endometrial hyperplasia12 (42.9%)&#8195;Atypical endometrial hyperplasia6 (33.3%)Histotypes of cancer&#8195;Endometrioid30 (100%)3 (18.8%)&#8195;Serous06 (37.5%)&#8195;Others07 (43.8%)FIGO stage of cancer&#8195;I28 (93.3%)10 (62.5%)&#8195;II01 (6.2%)&#8195;III1 (3.3%)3 (18.8%)&#8195;IV1 (3.3%)2 (12.5%)Histological grade of cancer&#8195;G120 (66.7%)4 (25.0%)&#8195;G28 (26.7%)2 (12.5%)&#8195;G309 (56.2%)&#8195;Unknown2 (6.7%)1 (6.2%)\nFig. 1DNA methylation levels for four candidate genes detected by quantitative methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (qMS-PCR) in 96 cervical scrapings. a DNA methylation levels are displayed as the difference in crossing point (&#916;Cp) values for each candidate gene.

As expected, PTEN mutations were common in 63.3% of type I ECs, and TP53 mutations in 93.6% of type II ECs (Fig. 2b). TP53 mutations were also common in type I ECs (63.3%), and these were primarily missense mutations. Unexpectedly, PTEN and TP53 mutations were commonly found in cervical scrapings of control patients and those with benign uterine lesions. PTEN and TP53 mutations could be detected in controls (25% and 33.3%, respectively) and patients with benign uterine lesions (10% and 50%, respectively) (Fig. 2b). Simultaneous PTEN and TP53 mutations correlated with disease progression from 8.3% (controls), to 10% (benign uterine lesions), to 34.7%, in EC cancers.\nFig. 2Localization of mutations in PTEN and TP53 gene sequences in the patient cohort. a The distribution and spectrum of PTEN (top) and TP53 (bottom) mutations are shown.

For example, the sensitivities and specificities of PTEN and TP53 mutations for overall ECs were 52.2% and 86%, and 71.1% and 62%, respectively (Fig. 3b and Table 2). In addition to those genomic assays, we assessed whether three combinations of DNA methylation levels of the BHLHE22, CDO1, TBX5, and HAND2 genes identified in our previous study [18] might provide the best performance for EC detection in terms of sensitivity and specificity. The sensitivities and specificities of combined DNA methylation were 87.0&#8211;89.1% (BHLHE22/CDO1/HAND2) and 80.0&#8211;86.0% (BHLHE22/CDO1/TBX5), respectively. Adding genetic mutations increased the detection sensitivity of type I, but not type II ECs, but the specificity was severely compromised because of the numerous mutations detected in patients without ECs (Fig. 3b).\nFig. 3Comparison of genetic mutations (PTEN and TP53) and aberrantly DNA-methylated genes (BHLHE22, CDO1, HAND2, and TBX5) in cervical scrapings. a The distribution and frequency of PTEN and TP53 gene mutations in non-endometrial cancer (non-EC), type I EC, and type II EC are shown.

EC already has a high prevalence, and its morbidity and mortality rates continue to increase; however, to our knowledge, no existing screening method can effectively detect either precancerous lesions or early-stage cancer. The need for improved screening is particularly high because when detected early, EC survival rates dramatically improve. EC is a heterogeneous disease [25], and the risks of EC development are highly influenced by genetic and non-hereditary factors [26]. In light of the increase of high-risk populations due to the current aging and obesity epidemics, women with risk factors such as postmenopausal bleeding, breast cancer treatment with hormone therapy, and a family history of Lynch syndrome desperately need novel and noninvasive molecular biomarkers that can detect EC early. In addition to being useful for genetic mutation testing [11, 27], cervical scrapings could also play a functional role in methylation-based screening [28] to facilitate the detection of EC. To that end, this study was the first to investigate whether combined testing of genetic mutations and epigenetic DNA methylation alterations from cervical scrapings would increase sensitivity and specificity for the detection of EC.Our study provides supporting evidence that epigenetic biomarkers (i.e., a BHLHE22/CDO1-based panel) may be more useful than genetic mutation-based biomarkers for detecting EC. In the 96 cervical scrapings, we found high AUC-ROCs for four hypermethylated genes (BHLHE22, CDO1, HAND2, and TBX5, which were previously identified by our group [18]) in patients with type I and type II ECs compared with patients with normal endometrium and endometrial hyperplasia. These genes have low methylation levels in cervical lesions (Additional file 1: Table S1). We also demonstrated that three-gene panels of hypermethylated BHLHE22/CDO1/HAND2 and BHLHE22/CDO1/TBX5 were significantly different between patients with and without EC. By contrast, PTEN and TP53 mutations were commonly found in cervical scrapings of healthy controls and those with benign gynecologic diseases. Clonal proliferations of nonmalignant cells and benign diseases have been described in the bone marrow and noncancerous tissue, and in endometriosis [29&#8211;32]. Although it these mutations might reflect benign or noncancerous endometrial lesions [10, 32], the mechanism underlying the mutational changes in normal endometrium and benign uterine lesions remains to be elucidated.We also provide exploratory insights that ECs may share common epigenetic events, and that DNA methylation changes regardless of genetic heterogeneity and clinicopathology. ECs are conventionally classified into types I and II according to their clinicopathological characteristics and heterogeneity at the genetic level. In addition to these genetic events, the role of epigenetics combined with mutation-driven classification remains unknown. An important issue is whether different panels of DNA methylation profiles might be able to distinguish the two EC histotypes. Our previous study [18] identified BHLHE22, CDO1, and CELF4 methylation in cervical scrapings as excellent molecular biomarkers for EC detection. When detecting type II ECs, 14 samples, except for one of the serous type (92.9%), showed hypermethylation of this three-gene panel. Our present study further confirmed that both type I and II ECs can be detected by a BHLHE22/CDO1-based methylation profile. BHLHE22 (also known as BHLHB5) encodes a basic helix&#8211;loop&#8211;helix transcription factor and has been implicated in neural development, including cell growth, cell differentiation, and cell migration [33]. CDO1 is a tumor suppressor gene, and methylation of its promoter region has been found in numerous cancers [34, 35]. Additionally, T-box transcription factor 5 (TBX5) is a member of a phylogenetically conserved family of genes involved in the regulation of developmental processes. The function of TBX5 in cancer development is largely unclear [36&#8211;38]. HAND2 is a progesterone-regulated stem cell polycomb group target gene that encodes a transcription factor expressed in the endometrial stroma to suppress estrogen-mediated signals. One previous study [14] reported that DNA methylation of HAND2 could be a key step in EC development and, thus, could potentially be used as a biomarker for the early detection of ECs.Today, mutations in PTEN and TP53 are best documented in genetic lesions occurring in sporadic ECs. In our present and previous studies, PTEN mutations were detected in 63.3% of type I ECs and 31.2% of type II ECs [5, 39]. Up to 93.6% of type II and 63.3% of type I EC patients harbored detectable TP53 mutations in their cervical scraping samples. Therefore, TP53 mutations are not restricted to type II endometrial serous carcinomas; they are also present in a subset of type I endometrial endometrioid carcinomas. The potential relationship between mutations in TP53 and PTEN, as observed in endometrial carcinoma, is still poorly known [40&#8211;42]. Furthermore, to ensure that genetic screening profiles are more informative, we assert that the mutation-based detection thresholds should be stricter, and that the criteria to determine cutoff points should be more specific. PTEN mutations seem to be of little importance in uterine cervical lesions [43]. Our supplementary data showed that PTEN and TP53 mutations had been found in 13% and 9% of cervical squamous cell carcinoma cases, respectively (Additional file 1: Figure S2). Recently, Salk et al. reported that subclonal mutations in cancer evolutionary processes were ubiquitous and part of normal human aging. Therefore, great care must be taken to distinguish tumor-derived from age-associated mutations in high-sensitivity clinical cancer diagnostics [44].Despite its notable findings, our study had several limitations. First, it was retrospective rather than prospective. Moreover, the samples examined were derived from patients with abnormal uterine bleeding. In a screening setting, endometrial premalignant lesions and cancers will include earlier stage cancers and asymptomatic women. Early detection and treatment prediction require further validation, both in prospective and unbiased cohorts. Additionally, we need to explore the value of combined genetic and epigenetic analyses of DNA obtained from cervical scrapings during a routine Pap test in asymptomatic women to detect hidden ECs. Second, cutoff values for candidate biomarker genes for research purposes might not be directly applicable to clinical settings or the wider population, thereby warranting further validation in larger, population-based studies. Third, we found mutation and methylation changes in cervical scrapings from women with normal endometrium and benign uterine diseases. These &#8220;background&#8221; readings could interfere with the sensitivity and specificity rates of the detection of ECs, necessitating some type of filtering. Finally, the highest methylation levels we detected were in fully cancerous tissues, atypical endometrial hyperplasia, or stage I diseases. Thus, future studies should concentrate on identifying biomarkers specific for these types of cells for early detection.\nConclusions\nIn conclusion, we demonstrated promising epigenetic biomarkers in cervical scrapings for EC screening to triage women with abnormal uterine bleeding for invasive procedures. These epigenetic biomarkers could broaden the scope of Pap testing and potentially be employed to detect ECs in the early stage, when the disease is easiest to treat. The value of adding genetic- to epigenetic-based biomarkers to detect EC requires further investigation.\nSupplementary information\n\nNone\n\nAdditional file 1: Table S1.

Only four cases of community-acquired bacteremic K. pneumoniae pneumonia were seen in the 2-year study period in the United States, Argentina, Europe, or Australia; none were in alcoholics. In contrast, 53 cases of bacteremic K. pneumoniae pneumonia were observed in South Africa and Taiwan, where an association with alcoholism persisted (p=0.007). Twenty-five cases of a distinctive syndrome consisting of K. pneumoniae bacteremia in conjunction with community-acquired liver abscess, meningitis, or endophthalmitis were observed. A distinctive form of K. pneumoniae infection, often causing liver abscess, was identified, almost exclusively in Taiwan.", "body": "Methods\nA prospective study of consecutive patients with community-acquired K. pneumoniae bacteremia was performed in 12 hospitals.1 The study period was January 1, 1996, to December 31, 1997. Records of patients >16 years of age with positive blood cultures for K. pneumoniae were reviewed, and a 188-item study form was completed. All items on the form were objective criteria, allowing standardization among medical centers. The study was observational in that administration of antimicrobial agents and other therapeutic management were controlled by the patient&#8217;s physician, not the investigators.Community-acquired bacteremia was defined as a positive blood culture taken on or within 48 hours of admission. Severity of acute illness at the time of positive blood cultures was assessed by a previously validated scoring system, based on mental status, vital signs, need for mechanical ventilation, and recent cardiac arrest (Pitt bacteremia score) (35). Type of infection was defined as pneumonia, urinary tract infection, meningitis, incisional wound infection, other soft tissue infection, intraabdominal infection, and primary bloodstream infection, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention definitions (36). In addition, distinctive sites of K. pneumoniae bacteremia were further defined as liver abscess, meningitis, or endophthalmitis. Liver abscesses were defined by the coexistence of blood cultures positive for K. pneumoniae and evidence of an intrahepatic abscess cavity by ultrasonography or computed tomography. Meningitis was defined as culture of K. pneumoniae from cerebrospinal fluid, and endophthalmitis was defined as decreased visual acuity, pain, hypyon, or severe anterior uveitis in a patient concurrently bacteremic with K. pneumoniae. Death was defined as including deaths from all causes within 14 days of the date the first positive blood culture for K. pneumoniae was obtained.Blood cultures of K. pneumoniae were sent by participating hospitals on nutrient agar slants to a central study laboratory in Pittsburgh, where the identity of each isolate as K. pneumoniae was confirmed by the Vitek GNI system (Biomerieux Vitek, Hazelwood, MO). Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production was defined phenotypically by broth dilution as a &#8805;3 twofold concentration decrease in MIC for either cefotaxime or ceftazidime tested in combination with clavulanic acid compared with the MIC when tested alone. The protocol was reviewed and approved by Institutional Review Boards according to local requirements.All data were entered into a central database (PROPHET version 5.1; BBN Systems and Technologies Corporation, Cambridge, MA). Contingency data were analyzed by two-tailed chi-square or Fisher&#8217;s exact tests, and continuous data were analyzed by Student t test or Mann-Whitney U test.\n Results\nTwo hundred two (44.4%) of 455 episodes of K. pneumoniae bacteremia during the study period were community-acquired cases. The percentage of cases of K. pneumoniae bacteremia that were community acquired in each study country differed strikingly: 96 (68%) of 142 in Taiwan, 25 (43%) of 68 in the United States, 28 (39%) of 71 in Australia, 40 (34%) of 116 in South Africa, 6 (22%) of 27 in Europe, and 7 (17%) of 41 in Argentina. K. pneumoniae bacteremia in Taiwan was significantly more likely to be community acquired than was bacteremia in the other countries combined (68% vs. 36%, p=0.0001).The characteristics of patients with community-acquired K. pneumoniae bacteremia from Taiwan, South Africa, and the rest of the world were compared (Table 1). The source of bacteremia in community-acquired cases was geographically distinctive (Table 2). Pneumonia was the most common infection worldwide, accounting for 57 (28%) of 202 cases. However, 53 (93%) of 57 of all cases of community-acquired K. pneumoniae pneumonia occurred in Taiwan and South Africa.Antibiotics had been used for >24 hours before admission in 21 (10%) of 202 patients. Prior antibiotic use was significantly lower in Taiwan (4 [4%] of 96 patients) and South Africa (2 [5%] of 40) than in the other countries (15 [23%] of 66) (p=0.0003). In four patients, the prior antibiotic was an oxyimino-containing cephalosporin (two in South Africa, one in Argentina, and one in Taiwan).ESBL production was detected in 7 (3.5%) of 202 community-acquired strains compared with 78 (30.8%) of 253 hospital-acquired strains (p<0.00001). None of the patients with community-acquired ESBL-producing strains had recently received an oxyimino-containing cephalosporin. However, of the seven patients with community-acquired ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae bacteremia, only one (a patient with pneumonia from Africa) had no recent hospital exposure. The countries from which community-acquired ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae isolates were collected included Africa (three isolates), Turkey (two), the United States (one), and Australia (one). Twenty-five bloodstream isolates were ciprofloxacin resistant, of which 7 (28%) of 25 were community acquired. All these seven patients had serious underlying disease and frequent hospitalizations or nursing home admissions, and none had received a quinolone in the 14 days before hospital admission. Five of seven patients with community-acquired, ciprofloxacin-resistant K. pneumoniae bacteremia were from Taiwan.\nCommunity-Acquired Pneumonia\nCommunity-acquired pneumonia due to K. pneumoniae was significantly associated with alcoholism (p=0.007); 18% of patients with pneumonia were alcoholics as defined by their physicians, compared with 4% with other sources of K. pneumoniae bacteremia (Table 3). However, no patient with community-acquired K. pneumoniae bacteremic pneumonia outside South Africa or Taiwan was an alcoholic; of these patients, one was neutropenic, two were nursing home residents with neurologic impairment (ages 81 and 90), and one was a Vietnamese immigrant to Australia with no underlying illness.Community-acquired pneumonia due to K. pneumoniae was significantly associated with HIV infection on univariate evaluation (p=0.002). Of the seven patients with HIV infection and K. pneumoniae bacteremia (all from Africa), six had community-acquired pneumonia. Community-acquired pneumonia due to K. pneumoniae was not associated with underlying liver disease, chronic renal failure, receipt of chemotherapy for malignant disease, or receipt of corticosteroids.Multivariate analysis showed that residing in Africa (p=0.0001) or Taiwan (p=0.0046) and being an alcoholic (p=0.04) were significantly associated with community-acquired K. pneumoniae pneumonia. HIV infection was not independently associated with pneumonia (p=0.23). The death rates from community-acquired pneumonia due to K. pneumoniae were 54% in Taiwan and 56% in South Africa.\nA Distinctive \nTwenty-five patients had a distinctive syndrome of K. pneumoniae bacteremia, which was defined by the presence of K. pneumoniae bacteremia in conjunction with liver abscess, endophthalmitis, or meningitis. Of these patients, 88% (16 with liver abscess, 4 with meningitis, 1 with liver abscess and meningitis, and 1 with endophthalmitis) were from Taiwan, compared with 12% from the other countries combined (2 with meningitis from South Africa and 1 with liver abscess from Belgium) (p=0.0001).Twelve (67%) of 18 patients with liver abscess had diabetes mellitus. On univariate analysis, residing in Taiwan (p=0.0001) and having diabetes mellitus (p=0.001) were significantly associated with community-acquired K. pneumoniae liver abscess. Patients with liver abscess were more likely to have renal failure, but this association was not statistically significant (p=0.09). There was no association between liver abscess and gender, age, previous antibiotic use, or presence of underlying liver disease. Multivariate analysis showed that residence in Taiwan (p=0.0034), diabetes mellitus (p=0.0058), and renal failure (p=0.0178) were significantly associated with the presence of liver abscess.Patients with any of the distinctive manifestations of K. pneumoniae (liver abscess, meningitis, or endophthalmitis) were compared with patients with other community-acquired infections (Table 4). These complications were significantly associated with diabetes mellitus (60% vs. 28%, p=0.0015) and living in Taiwan (88% vs. 42%, p=0.0001).\nDiscussion\nWhen pneumonia due to Klebsiella was first described by Friedlander in 1882, he believed it to be the most common cause of bacterial pneumonia (37). Although this concept was soon refuted in favor of pneumococcus, from the 1930s through the 1960s, 10 to 50 cases of Klebsiella pneumonia were reported each year by large hospitals in the United States (2). U.S. textbooks of medicine continue to list K. pneumoniae as an important cause of community-acquired pneumonia (38,39).In our prospective study, we found only four cases of community-acquired K. pneumoniae pneumonia in 2 years in nine large hospitals from the United States, Australia, Europe, and Argentina. The hospitals surveyed included an inner-city veterans hospital in the United States and two large inner-city public hospitals in Australia. These three centers care for large numbers of indigent and alcoholic patients.Recently published reports from the United States, Israel, and Europe support our observations. Neither Vergis et al. (40) from the United States nor Lieberman et al. (41) from Israel found a single case of K. pneumoniae pneumonia in large multicenter studies of community-acquired pneumonia in the 1990s. Nine European studies published since 1990 show that only 14 (2.3%) of 621 patients admitted with severe community-acquired pneumonia requiring intensive-care unit admission had K. pneumoniae as the presumptive etiologic agent (42&#8211;50). In contrast, K. pneumoniae continues to be associated with community-acquired pneumonia in Africa and Asia. In our study, we observed 28 cases in Taiwan and 25 in South Africa, accounting for 29% and 62% of all cases of community-acquired K. pneumoniae bacteremia in South Africa and Taiwan, respectively (Table 2). Recent studies from Taiwan, Singapore, and South Africa corroborate these findings. In a Taiwanese study, K. pneumoniae accounted for 34% of 41 cases of community-acquired bacteremic pneumonia (51). K. pneumoniae was the cause of 15% of community-acquired pneumonia requiring intensive-care unit admission in Singapore (52). K. pneumoniae was found to be the cause of pneumonia in 32% of African patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia requiring intensive-care unit admission in Johannesburg (53) and 11% of patients requiring intensive-care unit admission in Cape Town (54).In our study, 18% of patients with community-acquired K. pneumoniae pneumonia were alcoholics (p=0.007) (Table 3). Alcoholics in Africa and Asia may have limited access to health care (perhaps including reduced access to antibiotics) compared with those in the Americas, Europe, and Australia, and may have respiratory symptoms later. A weakness of our study is that we were not able to ascertain the duration of symptoms before each patient was hospitalized. However, a recent study of aborigines from rural northern Australia (35% of whom were alcoholics and most of whom had suboptimal access to health-care facilities) showed that none of 90 admitted to hospital with community-acquired pneumonia had K. pneumoniae infection (55). The hypothesis that Klebsiella pneumonia is related to poor primary health care for alcoholics may therefore be less plausible.Bacteremic K. pneumoniae liver abscess occurred almost exclusively in patients from Taiwan (Table 2), consistent with a growing number of reports from Asia describing this distinctive type of infection. K. pneumoniae was the most common cause of liver abscesses in Taiwan, Singapore, and Korea in reports from 1990 to 1999 (5,9,24,31,32); similarly, numerous reports of liver abscess have recently been published from Hong Kong, Thailand, and Japan (23,25&#8211;30). In total, >900 patients with K. pneumoniae liver abscess have been reported from Asian countries in the last 10 years; in contrast, reports of only 23 patients with this condition have been published from regions outside Asia in this same period (56&#8211;63).K. pneumoniae meningitis in adults has also been infrequently reported from North America, Europe, and Australia, in contrast to Taiwan. In our study, five cases of bacteremic K. pneumoniae meningitis were in Taiwanese patients and two in African patients (Table 2). Four (57%) of 7 patients with meningitis had prior diabetes mellitus. Meningitis caused by K. pneumoniae in the United States, Australia, and Europe is most often hospital acquired and associated with prior neurosurgical procedures or instrumentation. However, of 115 cases of K. pneumoniae meningitis reported from Taiwan (33,64,65), 84% were community acquired, and 64% of cases had concurrent Klebsiella bacteremia. Unlike pyogenic liver abscess, the clinical course was fulminant, with a death rate of 57% (33,64,65). The death rate from bacteremic K. pneumoniae meningitis in our series was 71%.We found only one patient (an alcoholic from Taiwan) with K. pneumoniae bacteremia and endophthalmitis. K. pneumoniae endophthalmitis is also likely to be far more common in Asia than elsewhere; >50 cases have been reported in the last 10 years from Asia (6,10,11,19,27,66&#8211;70) compared with only 10 from the United States, Europe, and Australia (57,60,62,71&#8211;76). More than 50% of previously reported Asian patients with K. pneumoniae endophthalmitis have had concurrent liver abscess (6,10,11,19,27,66&#8211;70).The reason for the geographic preponderance of these severe manifestations of K. pneumoniae infections in Asia is unknown. The geographic diversity of Klebsiella infections possibly results from interaction between bacterial variables, host variables (for example, defects in host defense caused by diabetes mellitus or alcoholism), socioeconomic factors, and possibly genetic susceptibility in different racial groups. We are studying the phenotypic and genotypic differences in K. pneumoniae causing different disease manifestations in different countries. Because no more than three hospitals from each country were included in our study, our results may not necessarily be generalizable to hospitals in other regions. In addition, other countries in the same continent (e.g., other countries in Asia or eastern Europe) were not studied but may have different clinical patterns compared with the study country.In summary, our results challenge the classic view of serious Klebsiella infections. In the United States, Europe, Argentina, and Australia, we have observed that hospital-acquired K. pneumoniae infections predominate, with community-acquired bacteremia being caused by urinary tract infection, vascular catheter infection, and cholangitis. Classic community-acquired pneumonia is no longer an important entity in these regions. In South Africa, pneumonia (especially in alcoholics) continues to be an important community-acquired infection. In Taiwan, community-acquired pneumonia persists, and distinctive infections such as liver abscess, endophthalmitis, and meningitis have emerged as substantial public health problems.", "pmid": "11897067", "title": "Community-Acquired Klebsiella pneumoniae Bacteremia: Global Differences in Clinical Patterns", "journal_title": "Emerging Infectious Diseases", "authors": "Wen-Chien Ko;David L.

Many PHC patients will end up with painful arthritis at some stage in their adult life and, if not identified early on, may require a hip replacement at a young age. In DDH, the hip socket is too shallow, and the femoral head is not held tightly in place, so the hip joint is loose. In severe cases, the femur can come out of the socket (dislocate). This results in a mechanical overload of the anterolateral acetabular rim and labrum. The clinical diagnosis of DDH is confirmed by sonographic imaging (in the first months of life), while late presenting pathological DDH (>6 months of age) is usually diagnosed by an X-ray(s) of the pelvis. Dysplasia, subluxation, and dislocation of the hip joint are often associated with the development of premature osteoarthritis (OA) in young adults.2 Perthes disease occurs when the blood supply to the head of the femur (thighbone) is temporarily disrupted. Without an adequate blood supply, the bone cells die, a process called avascular necrosis and the head of the femur then becomes mis-shaped. The condition is most commonly found in children between the ages of 4 and 8, but it has also been identified in children and adolescents between the ages of 2 and 15.1 In the long term, the mis-shapen femoral head can remain so that it produces a permanent deformity, which increases the risk of developing osteoarthritis in adults1 Slipped Upper Femoral Epiphysis is a condition that happens in late childhood/early adolescence; in this condition, the epiphysis of the femoral head displaces or slips out of alignment from the rest of the femur. The longer-term implications of this happening are that there is a change in shape of the hip joint.It is widely accepted that, for PHCs, an early diagnosis is most beneficial, but many cases go undetected until later childhood, adolescence, or early adulthood. This can result in a lifetime of significant long-term morbidity, including gait abnormalities, chronic pain, and premature degenerative arthritis of the hip and leads to a number of very invasive surgeries.3 In essence, all three conditions can lead to premature arthritis of the hip in later years. The extent of OA depends on how severely the shape of the hip joint is altered by the disease. All the PHCs are complex conditions that are often hard to diagnose, and later early adult manifestation can lead to prolonged disability. Patients will frequently present with symptoms in adolescence or young adulthood, although sometimes they present at older ages, in their 40s or 50s. Unless the PHC is diagnosed promptly, patients will experience pre-arthritic symptoms associated with anterolateral labral tears and synovial cysts which eventually progress to articular cartilage degeneration, unless the hip joint mechanics are corrected by surgical intervention2 The disease progression from pre-surgery presentation, through to corrective surgery to post-surgery and extensive periods of rehabilitation can have serious health implications for the young population affected by these conditions. Corrective surgery for these conditions is very invasive followed by a long period of rehabilitation.The treatment of arthritic hip disease in young patients is a rapidly evolving area. Surgical acetabular reorientation is the most common surgical approach and can optimize femoral head coverage, decrease articular cartilage loading, delay or prevent the development of secondary osteoarthritis, and enhance patient function and activity2 Treatment is most successful during the early arthritic phase of the disease; thus, early diagnosis is important. However, Nunley2 found that patients with DDH were taking an average of 5.1 years to be diagnosed, by which time symptoms become more profound. If arthritis has progressed, then the options for treatment become more limited. Most commonly, the only option is to replace the hip, which for young patients can mean further revisions throughout their life and can also cause significant psychological distress.3Surgery is often very invasive, and patients can expect to be walking with crutches for 8&#8211;12 weeks followed by a prolonged period of rehabilitation. The rehabilitation process is difficult, and it can take up to one year for a patient to fully feel the benefits of surgery. Treatment of borderline cases is also controversial. Hip arthroscopy has often been the chosen treatment, but it carries a high risk of reoperation. A broad range of surgeries now exists, but no comparison studies have been conducted to look at their effectiveness. There is great uncertainty about the effectiveness of treatment, compounded by lack of agreement about which outcomes should be measured. Very few studies exist that focus on the patient experience of surgery and recovery and rehabilitation.We know very little about the quality of life (QoL) and psychological impact of PHCs. If left undetected or untreated, they may lead to significant pain and functional problems which will greatly impact on everyday life (for example, ongoing pain, effect on exercise, family and social life) and QoL.4,5 For some, this will lead to profound disability associated with progressive hip degeneration and eventual end-stage disease. Additionally, little research has been conducted on the impact of adult hip conditions focusing on early presentation and symptoms.The impact of the conditions throughout presentation, diagnosis, treatment, and longer-term effects on patient QoL can be quite significant. For example, patients can face a lifetime of uncertainty as to what the longer-term effects of hip dysplasia are. Long-term studies of surgical treatment for DDH have shown that periacetabular osteotomy (PAO) can last for up to 20 years if the patients had no cartilage damage at the time of surgery. In these studies,6&#8211;9 failure was defined as revision to a total hip replacement (THR) and many PAO&#8217;s do not last as long as 20 years. What is not clear from the literature is the long-term impact on a patient&#8217;s physical and socio-psychological well-being in their everyday life.\nMeasuring PHC outcomes\nCareful selection of meaningful outcome measures is crucial in conducting clinical trials to include outcomes that matter to patients. A recent systematic review of the efficacy of PAO&#8217;s highlighted that there was a lot of variance in the way that studies reported clinical outcomes.10 This study highlighted that progress in this field is dependent on measuring accurate, clear, and consistent outcomes which in turn is dependent on the development of new validated, patient-based outcome measures. This would allow more precise and wide-ranging analysis of clinical improvement. In young adult hips, operative success has been measured by using objective measures such as radiologic imaging which measures the anatomical variation in the hip and how it varies from normal and deformity correction after surgery, improvements in range of motion are also measured.11 Additionally, standardized hip outcome scores are frequently used in the literature including the modified Harris Hip Score (mHHS), Hip Outcome score Activities of Daily Living (HOS-ADL), HOS-Sport-Specific Subscales (HOS-SSS), 12-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12), and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC).12&#8211;15 The scores have all been validated for assessing advanced OA in a much older population, but they may not be fit for purpose in a young adult hip population. Young adults often have higher physical activity expectations and outcomes will vary. For example, being able to simply complete daily activities of life may not be deemed a positive outcome in young adults.15&#8211;17 These measures do not always embrace high impact activities that young adults will demand of their hips post-operatively.15&#8211;17For patients undergoing hip preservation surgery, patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures are becoming an integral part of measuring the efficacy of treatment. Ramisetty et al18 conducted a systematic review, their specific aim was to critically appraise the quality of PRO&#8217;s in order to recommend the most appropriate PRO tool(s) for future use. They included studies which compared patients with a variety of hip conditions, and surgical methods used to treat the conditions, including arthroscopy and surgery for dysplastic and non-dysplastic hips. Six PRO tools from ten articles were identi&#64257;ed. The most recently developed PRO tools - the hip outcome score (HOS), the Copenhagen hip and groin outcome score (HAGOS) and the International Hip Outcome Tool (iHOT-33) - scored better than the others. The iHOT-33 scored best of all the PRO tools, and they recommended it for future use in hip preservation surgery. The iHOT-33 was developed with the cooperation of the multi-center arthroscopy of the hip outcomes research network (MAHORN) and it was designed to measure the outcomes of treatment in young active patients with hip disorders (18 or older and up to 60 years old). However, this measure has primarily been used in patients undergoing arthroscopy. Many would argue that these patients are not as debilitated as patients with more severe hip dysplasia, Perthes, and SUFE who are undergoing osteotomies. It is also noticeable that psychological impact is not measured in any of the measures reviewed in this study despite this being a significant factor for adult patients with a PHC.4\nBroader outcome measures used in hip studies\nSim et al (2015)19 conducted a systematic review to evaluate the reporting of non-hip score outcomes following surgical management of femora-acetabular impingement (FAI). Patients diagnosed with hip dysplasia and Perthes can also have impingement. The most common non-hip score outcomes reported included: patient satisfaction (72.7%), symptom improvement (24.7%), pain improvement (12.4%), hip range of motion (12.3%), and return to sport (6.8%)19 What is interesting about this study is that a discrepancy exists between what outcomes the literature suggests should be reported and what outcomes are often reported. For example, &#8220;return to sport&#8221; is often held as a major patient-important outcome yet it is rarely reported in studies assessing the ef&#64257;cacy of FAI surgery. This systematic review highlighted differences between what patients consider to be an important outcome and non-hip score outcomes reported in the literature.19 Impellizzeri et al20 also found that &#8220;reduction in hip pain&#8221; was the most cited reason for pursuing surgery, followed by ability to &#8220;return to sport&#8221;. This lends further credence to the need for outcome measures focused on young people which measure aspects important to their needs and can be incorporated clinical trials. Although most research in hip dysplasia has focused on pain and function, there has been a recent and growing interest in measuring the real-world impact on patients through broader assessments of QoL. Several studies have focused on the emerging area of movement and movement analysis21 Movement analysis provides an objective examination of hip mechanics in the patient and therefore measures different aspects of the effects of hip dysplasia. Problems with walking have been documented in patients with untreated hip dysplasia.21&#8211;24 This can have a significant impact on patients as they will walk with a defined limp and abnormal-appearing posture. However, its physical and psychological impact and impact on body image are to date unexplored.Hip pain itself may prevent participation in social, recreational, and sports activities and directly impact QoL. Numerous studies on outcomes after PAO focus on instruments of QoL and hip function such as the WOMAC and the Harris Hip Score.17 Although these instruments provide information about patients&#8217; functional limitations and pain, they do not directly assess activity level and sports participation. Patients who participated in sports before surgery may wish to resume their activities after surgery. The &#8220;wish to return to recreation&#8221; often is cited by patients with hip pain as an important component of their disability.25 There is limited evidence, to date, regarding the physical activity levels patients can expect to achieve after surgery and which factors may affect resumption of or improvement on preoperative activity levels. Simple scores from a questionnaire may not give the full picture as patients may change activities by reducing impact sports. For example, Klit et al26 studied activity in patients with hip dysplasia seven years after PAO. The relatively low visual analog scores together with the relatively low score in the dimensions &#8220;sport and recreation&#8221; and &#8220;participation&#8221; may indicate that the patients reduce their sport activities and participation after PAO to minimize their symptoms, but at a psychological price, involving trying to manage expectations.There is also limited research considering broader aspects of QoL post-surgery. For example, &#8220;return to work&#8221; was studied in only one study27 This paper also considered that &#8220;limb length discrepancy&#8221; was an important factor for patient morale, motivation, and post-operative satisfaction. Some research28 has been conducted considering &#8220;insomnia and sleep&#8221; and their overall impact on QoL. Gambling and Long (2013),3 in their qualitative studies, also found that many patients struggled with their body image and self-esteem if there were long delays in diagnosis. Currently, measures do not exist which consider this global impact of PHCs in young adults. Furthermore, Perthes, with its occurrence in very young children, is a challenging area for instrument development; however, work is being conducted to develop an outcome measure for children with Perthes.29In summary, little is known about the psychological, economic, and personal impact of pediatric hip conditions.30 This lack of evidence makes it very difficult to assess patient need and evaluate treatments that best support patients. Whilst it is known that surgery can provide pain relief and improve hip function, the availability and use of an appropriate outcome measure focused on patient concerns and the potential impact of hip dysplasia on a broad range of factors, including pain, psychological health, social and familial impact, and QoL, would potentially improve treatment experience and patient&#8211;clinician interactions and provide an additional tool to use within the evaluation of clinical practice.This paper reports on the development of an outcome measure to assess the patient-significant and patient-identified impact of PHCs. The aim was to develop a patient-centered,31 evaluative32 outcome measure for pediatric hip conditions (the &#8220;Quality of Life, Concerns and Impact Measure&#8221; - QoLC&I) to be used by both patients and clinicians in discussions over treatment options and the evaluation of treatment and post-operative rehabilitation. Our guiding criteria were multiple, for the measure: to be based on the patient&#8217;s perspective and thus be user-centered; to have clinical utility and feasibility to use in clinical practice; and to have good psychometric properties (reliability, validity, and responsiveness to change). Appendix 1 summarizes the detail of our requirements.33,34,35 For a measure to be used in practice, it must also be of perceived high relevance to patients&#8217; concerns and useful for them and clinicians.31 Our measure has been designed to do this and is based on previous qualitative research. The implementation of the outcome measure would enable a clearer picture of the QoL impact and wider social and psychological impact on pediatric hip conditions.The measure is intended to add insight into physical, social, psychological, self-esteem and QoL factors of importance to patients and widen understanding about both patient treatment responses and factors that patients&#8217; value. As outlined above, limited knowledge of the socio-psychological and QoL effects of these conditions results in a clinical emphasis on physical/functional problems, without consideration of the wider social and psychological impact. The implementation of the outcome measure would enable a clearer picture of the QoL impact and wider social and psychological impact on PHCs. An overview of the study design for the development and validation of the measure is presented in Figure 1.Figure 1Overview of development and validation study design.Abbreviations: QOL, quality of life; QOLC&I, quality of life concerns and impact; DDH, developmental dysplasia of the hip; SUFE, slipped upper femoral Epiphyses.\nMethods\n\nDevelopment phase\nA qualitative study was conducted (2013-early 2015), drawing on two sources: two web-based forums (using patient narratives) and a specialist orthopedic adult hip clinic (conducting interviews).Participants were carefully selected, using the principle of diversity from the web sources. The use of two websites enabled diversity, allowing access to participants from a wider geographical area, some being close to specialist centers and others much further away; this would influence the nature and possibly quality of the care they had or were receiving. In addition, we were potentially able to recruit patients internationally, from the USA, Australia, and Europe. Recruiting from one specialist adult hip clinic (in the Royal Orthopaedic Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham) enabled insight into the perspective of patients who were receiving the best care.The aim was to recruit around 100 participants from the two sources and to ensure variability in time of first diagnosis (childhood or adulthood), clinical presentational time (pre or up to 12 months post-operative), and treatment stage (preventive, &#8220;to save my joints&#8221; or treatment following points of failure). By carefully selecting participants to ensure the potential for the expression of different experiences, such a sample size was expected to capture the required depth and richness of data. Ethical approval was given by Cardiff University Ethics Committee for the websites and NHS Ethical Committee (the Royal Orthopaedic Hospital NHS Foundation Trust) for the specialist clinic; the latter committee deemed the study as evaluation and thus as part of clinical practice development.\nInclusion criteria were\nWomen and men with a confirmed diagnosis of DDH, Perthes, or SUFEHaving an extensive DDH-, Perthes-, or SUFE-related treatment history following diagnosis in childhood/adolescence or newly diagnosed as young adults or following a recurrence/new symptomAged 18 or overEnglish speakersActive member of one of the two web forums/or attending the specialist orthopedic hip clinic.\nPatient recruitment\nTo recruit participants from the web sources, the site moderators were asked if they would allow access to their sites. Once agreement was ascertained, a message was posted on the websites seeking volunteers who fitted the research eligibility criteria. The message directed interested persons to a secure University of Cardiff-hosted website where further information about the research project was posted. Participants completed an electronic consent form, which included their e-mail contact details. Participants were then asked to complete a simple screening questionnaire. If they fitted the study criteria, they were invited to write a narrative about their experiences, covering, for example, their diagnosis, treatment history, treatment experiences and impact of the PHC on their lives and sense of self and feelings about the future. To assist their story writing, an indicative structure36,37 was provided of key areas to frame their story around, while encouraging them to write up their personal history in any way that they wished.In the specialist hip clinics, patients were recruited via the consultant hip surgeon who applied the inclusion criteria, dividing planned clinic consultations by type of visit (discuss treatment options, follow-up 6 weeks to 24 months post-treatment). The appointment clerk in each site sent consecutive patients meeting the inclusion criteria a participant information sheet, consent pro forma and, for the later part of the study, the draft outcome measure. Patients willing to take part in the study were asked to bring the completed consent pro forma and, where relevant, the completed outcome measure to their next clinic appointment. Data were collected on 84 patients through the websites and 38 patients from the clinics.\nData analysis\nData were analyzed in a thematic manner, exploring participants&#8217; meanings surrounding particular experiences, events, and states. A set of emerging themes (Figure 2) provided the basis for an initial model specification. These areas highlighted the impact of the condition and their concerns. They covered pain, physical activity, work, family and social impact, psychological impact, and overall QoL.Figure 2Emerging themes and illustrative extracts.The topic areas, or domains, were translated into questions, built around a five-level Likert scale, and a draft measure developed and then piloted. Firstly, the draft (1) measure was piloted with a subset of the online recruited participants (n=30), using an asynchronous38 web-based discussion group design, asking them to comment on the ease of understanding of its content, accessibility of language, ease of completion and coverage, including missing or suggested additional areas and question phrasing. The asynchronous nature meant that participants did not have to be present at the same time. Participants contributed their comments by responding to the initial discussion question or by responding to each other. All these responses were shown in the form of an outline or thread so that responses appeared following the entry to which they were replying. This discussion took place over a defined two-week period and was moderated by one of the research team (TG). Working together with the participants, enabling co-construction of the measure, ensured the patient-centered focus of the measure. The results of the pilot were analyzed with a view to refine the form, mode, and coverage of the questions within the measure in order to develop a revised outcome measure (draft 2) for psychometric validation.Second, this refined measure (draft 2) was piloted with both a group of clinicians and patients to assess its patient and clinical utility. The rationale for this further piloting related to the notion that, the more a measure focuses on aspects that matter to patients and to clinicians, the greater its validity, usefulness and likelihood of take-up by patients and into clinical practice. A target sample size of 5 practitioners and 15 patient interviews was set. Given the in-depth interview process, this sample size was sufficient to enable insight into the potential utility of the measure and ways to enhance this.39In-depth interviews supplemented with observation were used. Patients attending for a consultation at the Birmingham specialist hip clinic were asked to: complete the prototype the &#8220;Quality of Life, Concerns and Impact Measure&#8221; (draft 2) measure prior to their clinical consultation; share the completed measure with the practitioner; and take part in a semi-structured post-consultation interview. To assess face and content validity, a sample of 20 patients took part. Each patient participant was interviewed using a semi-structured instrument, at the end of their consultation (if convenient to the patient) or take part in a telephone interview at an agreed date and time. The interview used retrospective verbal probing, an established approach within cognitive interviews,40,41&#160;and recommended way to clarify the participant&#8217;s understanding of the items and use of a new instrument (DeWalt et al 2007).42 The interview explored: how their responses to the measure were used in the consultation; how useful/helpful they found this; how useful and relevant they found the items in the measure; perceived potential value of the measure in assessing/recognizing changes in their condition; and ways that the measure&#8217;s utility might be increased.The practitioners were asked to: talk through the patient&#8217;s responses to the items in the measure, as relevant to the consultation&#8217;s focus; at consultation/clinic end, write down perceptions of the usefulness of the instrument in assisting in the discussion with the patient over treatment options for subsequent sharing with the research team; and take part in an open-ended interview at the end of patient data collection. One interview with each hip consultant was conducted sharing their earlier notes on the usefulness of the measure. The interview used &#8220;retrospective&#8221; verbal probing, exploring how they made use of the measure in the consultation in general and the potential value of the measure in assessing changes in symptoms and impact; and ways that the measure&#8217;s utility might be increased. Four practitioners, the only ones with whom the patients had a consultation, were interviewed.To gain additional insight into how the consultants used the measure, a member of the research team observed a small number (10) of their consultations, with the patient&#8217;s permission. All interviews were audiotaped and transcribed, and field notes made for the clinic consultation observation. Directed content analysis43 was used, drawing on the core interview question headings, with an openness to additional areas, to summarize perceived utility, ways to enhance this and factors facilitating and inhibiting utility.Following data analysis, a prototype (draft 3) measure was created ready for psychometric evaluation, based around the final conceptual model (Figure 3). The measure was targeted at persons with a PHC aged 16 years to 49 years.Figure 3Model specification for the quality of life, concerns, and impact measure.\nTesting and validation phase\n\nStudy design\nA cross-sectional survey based on a retrospective pre-test design was used to explore measure validity. Test&#8211;retest validity and responsiveness to change were left for latter evaluation, due to administrative difficulties in the hip clinic in following up and re-contacting respondents. The retrospective pre-test design allowed respondents to report on their contemporary and retrospective (3 months before), in one section relating to QoL from the same individual reference point (with the benefit of knowledge of how their condition had changed). This design is recognized as being realistic, feasible, efficient, and reducing the likelihood of missing data44 and of demonstrable value where interest lies in changes in health-related quality of life.45To assess validity, a target sample size of 250 was set (125 for DDH; 125 for Perthes and SUFE together), calculated on the basis of recommended guidance on minimum number of cases (5) per item in the prototype measure and a 95% confidence interval for Cronbach&#8217;s alpha (reliability) coefficient of &#8805;0.746 and the measure having a maximum of 25&#8211;30 items. To ensure this target level was achieved, a 25% allowance for &#8220;not responding to invitation to participate&#8221; (participation rate) and a 25% allowance for subsequent &#8220;non-response to questionnaire completion&#8221; was made, leading to a sample size of around 375&#8211;400. NHS Ethical approval was provided by the Royal Orthopaedic Hospital NHS Foundation Trust Birmingham, and the research was conducted in the specialist hip in that site, over the time period, 2015&#8211;2016.\nRecruitment process\nFollowing informed consent and a signed consent form, the site&#8217;s research nurse gave each participant a copy of the questionnaire measure and, if necessary, a stamped addressed envelope to return the questionnaire to the research team. Patients were requested to complete the measure in relation to the hip they were currently receiving treatment for or, if both hips were symptomatic, the most problematic hip. Non-responders at this stage were sent, by the research nurse, one reminder letter only after two weeks, together with another copy of the questionnaire. Any non-responders after this were considered as refusals. The participants were asked to: complete the &#8220;Quality of Life, Concerns and Impact Measure&#8221; measure, together with short pro-forma seeking additional demographic (age, gender) and condition related data (height, weight, hip condition, length of time from the onset of symptoms to the definitive diagnosis).\nProcedures and measures\nThe prototype measure had nine domains (Symptoms (11 items); Education and Work (3); Sports and Exercise (7); Family Life (3); Physical Intimacy (3); Social Life and Relationships with Others (5); Confidence and Esteem (6); Body Image (10); and Overall QoL (14)) and three open questions relating to hopes and fears and potential usefulness of the measure in discussions with their clinicians (see Appendix 2 for a copy of the measure). To assess practicality, respondents were also asked to rate the ease of completion and time taken to complete the measure.To explore construct validity (convergent and divergent), all participants were also asked to complete some additional, validated tools which measured domains of the prototype measure. Patients&#8217; self-esteem, body image, and feelings of self-efficacy and quality of life were explored, using the following measures:\nDepression: General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) (10 items)47Quality of Life: International Hip Outcome Tool (iHOT-12) (12 items)16Coping: General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSE).48\nPsychometric analysis\nItems were subjected to statistical examination, using IBM SPSS for Windows versions 19&#8211;23 (SPSS Inc. Armonk, NY, USA), to explore issue of acceptability and practicality (response rate, missing item proportions, relevance to treatment decision-making), item analysis (item redundancy), reliability (internal consistency), and convergent/discriminant validity (Appendix 1). Following redundancy analysis, the psychometric properties of the reduced item version were assessed.\nFindings\n\nRespondents\nAs Table 1 shows, the sample 230 persons comprised 160 (70%) persons with a confirmed diagnosis of DDH, 35 (15%) with Perthes and 26 (11%) with SUFE; nine (4%) of the respondents did not indicate which PHC they had). The age and gender variation by condition, were as expected,1,49 similar to other studies. For example, 44% of those with DDH were female and aged 20&#8211;<35 and 11% were female aged 16&#8211;<20. In contrast, 53% of those with Perthes were male and aged 20&#8211;<35, whereas for SUFE, half were male and half female. About half of those with DDH and SUFE were affected in one hip, either the left or right, and about twice as many of those with Perthes were unilaterally affected. About three-fifths (61%) of the sample were working full or part-time, 17% were in education (school, FE college, or university) and 12% were unable to work due to ill-health. Just over three-fifths (60&#8211;64%) were either deciding what treatment to have or waiting for treatment for their left or right hip and 42&#8211;44% waiting for or had joint conservation surgery. Between 9% and 18% of the sample had had a THR in either the right or left hip, a substantial proportion (35%, left hip; 31%, right hip) having a THR aged under 30.Table 1Respondent characteristicsaVariableDDHPerthesSUFEDiagnosed condition72% (n=160)16% (n=35)12% (n=26)Age (years)(n=155)(n=32)(n=26)&#9679; Mean (standard deviation)30.4 (8.4)26.2 (6.8)23.9 (6.5)&#9679; Median (range)30 (16&#8211;45)25 (16&#8211;40)22 (16&#8211;39)&#9679; Aged under 20 n (%)18 (12%)6 (19%)10 (39%)&#9679; Aged 20-<35 n(%)81(52%)22 (58%)14 (54%)&#9679; Aged 35 or over n(%)56 (36%)4 (13%)2 (8%)Gender(n=155)(n=32)(n=26)&#9679; Male26 (17%)24 (75%)12 (46%)&#9679; Female129 (83%)8 (25%)14 (54%)Age and gender by diagnosis(n=155)(n=32)(n=26)GenderAge<20Age20&#8211;<35Age &#8805;35Age<20Age20&#8211;<35Age&#8805;35Age<20Age20-<35Age&#8805;35&#9679; Male113124173561&#9679; Female176844251580Job status:(n=160)(n=32)(n=26)&#9679; Employed (full or part-time)102 (64%)22 (69%)10 (38%)&#9679; Not working due to ill-health21 (13%)3 (10%)3 (12%)&#9679; In education (school or FE)23 (14%)5 (16%)9 (35%)&#9679; Looking after family9 (6%)1 (3%)3 (12%)&#9679; Unemployed5 (3%)1 (3%)1 (4%)Time to diagnosis (years)(n=144)(n=26)(n=20)&#9679; Mean (SD)2.6 (5.5)0.33 (0.33)1.5 (3.3)&#9679; Median (range)0.5 (0&#8211;33)0.10 (0.1&#8211;1)0.1 (0&#8211;13)Stage of treatment:left hip(n=110)(n=23)(n=20)&#9679; Deciding on treatment52 (47%)11 (48%)8 (40%)&#9679; Waiting for surgery23 (21%)2 (9%)1 (5%)&#9679; Up to 12 months post-op20 (18%)2 (9%)4 (20%)&#9679; Over 12 months post-op15 (14%)8 (35%)7 (35%)Stage of treatment:right hip(n=119)(n=18)(n=20)&#9679; Deciding on treatment49 (41%)9 (50%)10 (50%)&#9679; Waiting for surgery21 (18%)3 (17%)1 (5%)&#9679; Up to 12 months post-op25 (21%)4 (22%)4 (20%)&#9679; Over 12 months post-op24 (20%)2 (11%)5 (25%)Type of surgery:left hip(n=107)(n=23)(n=18)&#9679; Joint conservation45 (42%)3 (13%)5 (28%)&#9679; Triple/femoral osteotomy9 (8%)4 (17%)2 (11%)&#9679; Resurfacing surgery6 (6%)4 (17%)1 (6%)&#9679; Total hip replacement12 (11%)4 (17%)2 (11%)&#9679; Other5 (5%)3 (13%)2 (11%)&#9679; Don&#8217;t know30 (28%)5 (22%)6 (33%)Type of surgery:right hip(n=123)(n=18)(n=17)&#9679; Joint conservation54 (44%)5 (28%)2 (12%)&#9679; Triple/femoral osteotomy5 (4%)2 (11%)0 (0%)&#9679; Resurfacing surgery3 (2%)0 (0%)1 (6%)&#9679; Total hip replacement19 (15%)4 (22%)4 (24%)&#9679; Other7 (6%)1 (6%)2 (12%)&#9679; Don&#8217;t know35 (28%)6 (33%)8 (47%)Notes:\naThe total number of cases varies due to non-response to particular items, within the total sample size of n=230 (DDH=160; Perthes=35; SUFE=26; PHC not indicated=9).\n\nPsychometric evaluation\n\nAcceptability, practicality, and patient usefulness\nThe scale showed good acceptability. There were a number of questionnaires where the respondent, asked to complete the instrument while awaiting their outpatient hip appointment, had not had sufficient time to complete all the questions (approximately 20). Otherwise, there were very few missing items. There were low floor/ceiling effects (2 for the pain sub-sub-scale and 1 for sport and exercise), and the majority of sub-scales (6/10) had no extreme skewness. Exceptions were the pain, sports and exercise, social life, and overall QoL sub-sub-scales. There was also good spread over the range of the sub-scales and full scale (Table 2). Three-quarters of respondents (76%) indicated that they would find the measure useful in their discussions with clinicians (Table 2). For example, it gave the clinician insight into &#8220;the emotional and the physical,&#8221; &#8220;a better understanding of my lifestyle&#8221; and &#8220;its impact on my everyday life&#8221;. Around three-fifths (61%) of those who indicated that they would not find it helpful stated that &#8220;&#237;t was too late&#8221; as their treatment was completed or &#8220;these (areas) have already been discussed&#8221;.Table 2Accessibility, practicality, and data quality (n=230)PracticalityPracticalityMean (SD)Median (range)Non-Respondents Number (%)Ease of completion3.88 (1.06)4 (3&#8211;5)22 (10.62%)Time to complete measure (mins)19.3 (11.91)15 (10&#8211;20)22 (13.9%)Help in discussionsNot help in discussionsPatient perceived usefulness (%)76%24%37 (16%Acceptability and data qualityN (%) Missing (scale)Floor/Ceiling (individual items)Skewness (No. Items >1)No. Items >60%No. Items >80%Sub-sub-scalesPain28 (12% )203Education & work9 (4%)000Sport & exercise125 (54%)104family life25 (11%)000Physical intimacy36 (18%)000Social life88 (38%001Emotion & depession26 (12%)000Body image58 (25%)060Confidence & esteem12 (5%)000Quality of life45 (20%)003Sub-scalesPain concerns28 (12%)203Sport, work, family & social impact125 (54%)105Psychological impact58 (25%)000Quality of life impact45 (20%)003Full scaleQuality of life, concerns and impact78 (34%)3 items0(11 items)Scale featuresMean (SD)MedianRangeSkewnessNo. Items in ScaleSub-sub-scalePain56.0 (21.3)61.80&#8211;80&#8722;1.0411Education & work48.6 (30.2)50.00&#8211;1000.0863Sport & exercise80.0 (24.6)82.20&#8211;100&#8722;1.2736Family life52.9 (30.1)50.00&#8211;100&#8722;0.1333Physical intimacy53.8 (31-0.8)58.30&#8211;100&#8722;0.1743Social life37.4 (27.4)35.00&#8211;1000.4895Emotion & depression59.7 (25.2)64.30&#8211;100&#8722;0.4626Body image38.4 (23.2)34.30&#8211;80.00.1737Confidence & esteem39.1 (26.2)37.50&#8211;1000.1986Quality of life51.0 (21.1)52.90&#8211;80&#8722;0.46714Sub-scalePain concerns56.0 (21.3)61.80&#8211;80&#8722;1.0411Sport, work, family & social impact40.5 (19.1)430&#8211;79&#8722;0.25620Psychological impact41.4 (21.7)41.10&#8211;80.00.03119Quality of life impact51.052.90&#8211;80&#8722;0.4714Full scaleQuality of life, Concerns and impact43.6 (18.4)43.33.4&#8211;77.8&#8722;0.16664\n\nReliability\n\nThe measure had good internal consistency (Cronbach&#8217;s &#945; =0.98; average ICC =0.98), as did the sub-scales (Cronbach&#8217;s &#945; =0.95- 0.96; average ICC = 0.95-0.96) and each of the sub-sub-scales (Cronbach&#8217;s &#945; =0.85&#8211;0.97; ICC =0.59&#8211;0.89) (Table 3).

The one exception was the QoL sub-sub-scale, which had two factors; all items except for three (&#8220;I don&#8217;t feel good about myself&#8221;; &#8220;lost my life and identity&#8221;; &#8220;given up things I used to do and now have no normal life&#8221;) having high loadings on factor one (0.54&#8211;0.86) and the second comprising predominantly emotion-related items. The two sub-scales with multiple sub-sub-scale components, &#8220;sport, work, family and social impact&#8221; and &#8220;psychological impact&#8221; had, respectively, a three or two factor solution. For the former, the three factors were: impact on sports and exercise, impact on social relationships and education/work, and impact on family life and physical intimacy. For the latter, the two factors were impact on body image, and impact on feelings of self-worth and embarrassment. The full measure had a 10-factor solution, confirming the relevance and appropriateness of the sub-scale and sub-sub scale components, as indicated in the final model specification (Figure 2).\nConvergent and divergent validity\nThree validated outcome measures &#8211; GHQ, i-HOT-12 and GSE) &#8211; were used. Parts of our measure addressed psychological and emotion/depression and QoL impact; these would be expected to show evidence of convergent validity with both the GHQ and i-HOT-12. In contrast, divergent validity was assessed against the GSE, as it was not self-evident or plausible why a relationship, albeit but small, would be expected with the QoLC&I. As Table 4 shows, the predictions were fulfilled. The &#8220;psychological impact&#8221; sub-scale and the &#8220;QoL impact&#8221; sub-scales had, respectively, moderate convergent validity with GHQ and high convergent validity with the i-HOT-12. The GSE, assessing coping, was contrasted with the &#8220;psychological impact&#8221; and &#8220;sport, work, family and social impact&#8221; sub-scales; a low correlation was found for both. Together, these results provide supporting evidence for the convergent and divergent validity of the measure.Table 4Convergent and divergent validity (n=230)ScaleMean (SD)MedianRangeSkewnessNo items in scaleGHQ69.0 (12.4)70.833&#8211;100&#8722;0.5412iHOT-1234.7 (23.9)27.50.8&#8211;1001.012GSE72.2 (16.6)75.025&#8211;100&#8722;0.5510Contrast measureMeasure component(s)Pearson&#8217;s correlation (p)CommentsGHQPsychological impact&#8722;0.499 (p<0.001)ModerateiHOT-12Quality of life impact&#8722;0.822 (p<001)HighGSEPsychological impact&#8722;0.235 (p<0.002)LowGSESport, family and social impact&#8722;0.245 (p<0.005)Low\n\nDiscussion\nThe study has demonstrated that the 64-item QoLC&I measure, targeted at persons with a PHC aged 16&#8211;49 years, is acceptable to patients, has patient relevance, face and content validity, addresses areas of clinical importance, and is of potential value to both patients and clinicians in their interactions, discussions about treatment choices and treatment progress. The factor analysis shows good reliability (internal consistency) and provides supportive evidence of construct validity. Most importantly, the measure is grounded in the patient&#8217;s perspective, based on prior qualitative research by the authors. It priorities areas of importance and significance to patients with a PHC and is expressed in a set of understandable, and patient-derived and validated, Likert-type questions. Two validation areas remain to be explored - test&#8211;retest validity and responsiveness to change; both will form part of our next research study. It is also our intention and at the request of the hip clinicians in our research site at Birmingham to embark on a program to embed the current measure into clinical practice, studying these two outstanding validation aspects alongside.A major purpose behind the design of our measure was to create a measure directed specially to patients with a PHC, in contrast to other measures, for example, those reviewed by Ramisetty et al,18 and one with good coverage of areas (domains) identified as important and significant to patients. The mode of administration, via a self-completed questionnaire in a paper or Word format, supports easy and non-time-consuming completion and facilitates the feasibility and ease of clinical administration. Furthermore, the language that the measure is written in has been both derived from, and validated by, patients and confirmed as clinically relevant by a set of clinicians in the study site.The four sub-domains (sub-scales) cover a wide set of substantive areas, all of importance to patients. This set - pain concerns; sport, work, family and social impact; psychological impact; quality of life impact - has a broader coverage of key patient concerns than all other existing measures, including HAGOS and the iHot-12. This breadth is important, as it encompasses the perspective of the patient with a PHC; moreover, it provides clinicians with insight into patient concerns and the impact of the PHC on their everyday family life, social relationships, and QoL.The development of the measure, and its subsequent emergent validation, provides further evidence on the severity and impact of PHCs on patients and their families in their everyday lives. It also makes it clearer that impact is not just on QoL, unlike the iHOT-12/33. As noted earlier, the iHOT-33 was developed to address the concerns of young adult patients with hip disorders but has primarily been used in patients undergoing arthroscopy.4946 In contrast, patients with PHCs are often much more severely affected by their condition and the surgery is infinitely more invasive and a much longer recovery period. While mobility and pain have been measured previously in these patients (for example, in research studies using WOMAC, mHHS, and HOS-ADL), our measure also considers the effect and concerns about impaired mobility and pain, impact on self-esteem and body image, along with other areas. Again, specific measures exist that focus specifically and in detail on both constructs (for example, the Rosenberg self-esteem scale,50 The Body Image Disturbance Questionnaire BIDQ).51,52 However, these issues, for those with a PHC, also have a psychological impact on patients and also affect their social networks and ability to study or work. Our measure, unlike the i-HOT-12, explores psychological impact, as one core domain, along with impact on work/education and overall QoL.The qualitative work ensured that the measure was patient-centered and covered areas that patients felt were important. There were some important differences to other measures described in the literature review within arthritis, for example, less emphasis on pain and function and greater emphasis on self-esteem and body image. It is evident from our work that issues surrounding self-esteem and body image can arise specifically in patients with PHCs, related to the difficulties they have with mobility and posture. In addition, such patients are much younger than those who traditionally suffer from arthritis. They are mainly aged 18&#8211;40. Any chronic illness is likely greatly to affect education, work, family, and social life and more so than for older adults. Due to societal pressures to conform to social and physical stereotypes, PHC patients are also more likely to suffer self-esteem, confidence, and body image issues. Their psychological impact is likely to be profound and to affect several psychological constructs, including emotion and depression, body image, confidence, and self-esteem. PHC patients are more likely to display these psychological effects as they face life-changing events such as going to university, starting work and having children.The measure was developed to be used alongside other clinically focused measures in clinical trials or longitudinal outcome studies. Use of the QoLC&I in these studies would facilitate a better understanding of this patient group and gain additional insight into the physical and psychological impact of PHCs. Further knowledge of the psychological impact of PHCs would encourage development of psychological interventions to support patient recovery. Following further validation, the QoLC&I measure could also be used to identify patients who had become physically or psychologically impaired. As the management of painful borderline dysplastic hip is an issue of great controversy and is common in young adults with hip pain (a reported prevalence of 37.6% in selected patient hip dysplasia cohorts)53 our measure might support decision making, with such cases.Knowing the overall impact that a PHC has on the individual, physically and socially and psychologically, would help to inform decisions about treatment options and type of surgery. Clinicians in our study who have used the measure reported that it helped support conversations with patients about QoL, psychological impact, and socio-economic impact. It was also easy to use and could be completed before a consultation and then discussed within the consultation. Moreover, patients liked using the measure as it prompted clinicians to ask about wider issues. Future work needs to consider in detail how the measure informs decision making.\nStudy strengths and limitations\nThe study has a number of strengths. First, the development of the measure was based on our previous DDH qualitative studies,3,4 which explored participants&#8217; experiences from their stories about their everyday life with DDH and piloting of the emerging measure with a subset of these participants. Second, the refined measure was further piloted with a set of clinicians in the research site in relation to clinical utility and feasibility of use in routine clinical practice. Third, an adequate sample size was achieved for the development and psychometric validation of the measure.The study also has a number of limitations. First, participants in the qualitative study were self-selecting, responding to requests for participants on the web forums. It could be the case that the more vocal and potentially wishing to put forward strong views were more likely to take part. Second, there was potential self-selection in terms of who might seek, join, and make use of the web forums, as a source of support and advice. The bias effect of both of these cannot be assessed. Recruitment from dedicated PHC web forums is one of the few ways to access a diversity of participants; moreover, web forums are becoming a common and well-utilized mode for persons with a particular ill-health condition to gain insight into others&#8217; experiences and as a source of support and advice.54,55,56 Thirdly, the validation study was conducted in a single, specialist hip site, and valuably one where patients with one of the PHCs were referred to for specialist treatment. Interpretation of the study findings should take heed of these limitations. Further validation, in particular of test&#8211;retest validity and responsiveness to change, in additional specialist hip clinics would be valuable.\nFurther research\nFurther research areas include psychometric evaluation in additional specialist hip clinics, extension of the evaluation to explore test&#8211;retest reliability and responsiveness to change, and embedding the final measure into routine clinical practice, especially in secondary specialist care and rehabilitation. Additionally, the study&#8217;s findings could valuably be disseminated into primary care, to extend the insight of GPs and physiotherapists to PHCs and significant issues of key importance to persons with a hip condition, with subsequent study of its impact. At present, it is evident from our qualitative study that such persons are often wrongly perceived as, for example, having a groin strain or their symptoms being part of the maturity process, and thus often dismissed and inappropriately treated; this has significant impact on the delays to definitive diagnosis and referral to specialist hip treatment and care.2,3,4High-quality clinical research in PHC orthopedic surgery is beginning to emerge, previously predominantly being observational case series.53 One of the barriers to developing randomized controlled trials in this area is a paucity of robust outcome measures that access the range of desirable outcomes, thus the potential significance of our QoLC&I measure, and its capturing outcomes that are meaningful to the patient population and consider the wider impact of the conditions. Perry et al57 identified several priority areas that hip surgeons considered of high importance to study. All three PHCs featured among these priorities. For example, one aspect was phrased as &#8220;what are the current approaches used in the management of late presenting hip dysplasia in infants, and how may differences in treatment choices influence outcomes?&#8221; For research to be beneficial to the patient group more meaningful outcome measures will need to be developed, for example, in Perthes where we, with colleagues in Liverpool, have been developing and testing a young-child friendly and self-completed measure.28\nConclusion\nPatient-related outcomes measures should correspond to specific clinical situations and bring the opportunity to improve quality of care.58 An outcome measure must not only demonstrate the expected methodological properties and performance but also offer a positive contribution to patient care. The study has demonstrated that the 64-item QoLC&I measure is acceptable to patients, has patient relevance, addresses areas of clinical importance, and is of potential value to both patients and clinicians in their discussions about treatment choices and treatment progress. Most importantly, the measure is grounded in the patient&#8217;s perspective, based on prior qualitative research. It priorities areas of importance and significance to patients with a PHC and is expressed in a set of understandable, and patient-derived and validated, Likert-type questions. Measuring these important outcomes will enable us to learn more about the overall impact of PHC and facilitate the development of interventions which are focused on addressing the broader impact of the condition. Further work should focus on further psychometric testing and embedding the measure into clinical practice.", "pmid": "31388318", "title": "Development and validation of a patient-centered outcome measure for young adults with pediatric hip conditions: the &#8220;Quality of Life, Concerns and Impact Measure&#8221;", "journal_title": "Patient Related Outcome Measures", "authors": "Tina Gambling;Andrew F Long", "doi": "10.2147/PROM.S192672", "score": "0.019471623"}, {"keywords": "Antigen test;Heartworm;Immune complex dissociation;Slow-kill", "abstract": "Background\nAntigen testing is routinely used to diagnose canine Dirofilaria immitis infections.

Samples from 10% (n&#160;=&#160;112) of the dogs were antigen positive with the ICD protocol only while 90% of the results remained unchanged. In a prospective study, antigen levels with and without ICD were evaluated for 12 dogs receiving pre-adulticide heartworm treatment with a macrocyclic lactone and doxycycline for 28&#160;days. Serial samples revealed that three dogs had a reduction in detectable heartworm antigen within 4&#160;weeks of initiating treatment. In these cases, heartworm antigen levels could be recovered with ICD.Conclusions\nHeartworm antigen testing with ICD can be a valuable diagnostic tool for patients with discrepant results that have had intermittent use of a preventive, or have been treated with a macrocyclic lactone and doxycycline. Heartworm therapies may reduce antigen production and favor immune complexing in some dogs, resulting in false-negative results. Therefore, it is important to confirm positive heartworm antigen test results before initiating therapy.", "body": "Background\nDiagnosis of Dirofilaria immitis infections in dogs is primarily accomplished by detection of circulating antigen in serum, plasma, or whole blood samples [1&#8211;3]. Parasite antigen may be present in the free state or may be trapped in immune complexes when antibodies are present in excess of antigen, leading to reduced sensitivity and false-negative test results. In early versions of the heartworm antigen test, immune complex dissociation (ICD) methods were used to free heartworm antigen from being bound to antibodies and improve the sensitivity of the test [4, 5]. Methods used for dissociating these antigen&#8211;antibody complexes generally included pretreatment of samples with heat and/or EDTA, which denatured immune complexes (Fig.&#160;1). This step has been eliminated, however, from protocols of virtually all commercial D. immitis diagnostic assays over the past few decades as a result of improvements in assay technologies and antibody reagents [4].Fig. 1Illustration of antigen testing using an immune complex dissociation method, heat with EDTA, to liberate heartworm antigen\nSince early 2000, macrocyclic lactone heartworm preventives, often in combination with doxycycline, have been administered by veterinarians to heartworm-infected dogs to elicit a slow kill (SK) of heartworm adults when adulticide therapy is not an option for a particular dog [6]. Monthly preventive doses of macrocyclic lactones (with and without doxycycline) provide some level of efficacy in the death of heartworms; however, acceptable efficacy often requires extended periods of treatment, with some treatment durations as long as 1 to 2&#160;years [7]. Heartworm disease may progress during the SK treatment regimen and can eventually lead to severe pulmonary damage with multiple pathologic changes [8]. Despite the presence of adult worms for some time throughout the lengthy SK treatment, antigen levels often decline due to a decrease in antigen production and the development of immune complexes, leading to false-negative antigen test results and inability to assess the status of infection in dogs receiving SK treatment [6, 7, 9]. Most experts agree that SK is not an acceptable method for treating patent heartworm infections and should only be considered when melarsomine is contraindicated [3, 10].The purpose of studies described here were twofold: first, to evaluate different methods of ICD for the detection of heartworm antigen by microtiter plate ELISA, and second, to evaluate the use of ICD for antigen detection in samples from pet dogs, in particular for patients who have had discrepant results or have been treated with a macrocyclic lactone and doxycycline as a pre-adulticide therapy for a heartworm infection. The recommendation to use a combination of doxycycline and a macrocyclic lactone prior to the administration of melarsomine in D. immitis&#8211; infected dogs is based on clinical experience where it appears to reduce the likelihood and severity of adverse reactions [3, 10].\nMethods\n\nEvaluation of ICD methods\nSeveral different techniques for ICD have been described in the literature and applied to the dissociation of heartworm antigen&#8211;antibody complexes. The original commercial PetChek&#174; Heartworm Test (IDEXX Laboratories, Inc., Westbrook, Maine, USA) used a sample pretreatment method that included a pepsin reagent for ICD. In the current study, the pepsin method was compared with heat (with or without EDTA) and acidic pH methods. The methods for the ICD techniques evaluated in this study have been previously described [5, 11&#8211;14]. Briefly, the heat/EDTA method followed the procedure described by Weil et al., which diluted the serum sample with an equal volume of 0.1&#160;M EDTA (pH&#160;7.5) and heating to 100&#160;&#176;C for 5&#160;min followed by centrifugation at 16,000 &#215; g. Heat alone followed the method described by Little et al. and heated the sample at 104&#160;&#176;C for 10&#160;min followed by centrifugation. Following ICD, all samples were tested on a microtiter plate ELISA (PetChek&#174; Heartworm Test). Canine serum and plasma samples were used to evaluate the minimum starting sample volume needed to recover 100&#160;&#956;L of sample post-ICD for testing in the microtiter plate ELISA.A pretreatment positive control (PPC) was developed to confirm that each method evaluated in this study dissociated the immune complexes and released heartworm antigen. The PPC, which consisted of purified heartworm antigen mixed with polyclonal antisera directed against heartworm antigen, was included each time an ICD protocol was performed. In addition to the PPC, samples from five heartworm-infected dogs, where one or two adult female heartworms had been recovered at necropsy, and one uninfected dog, with no adult heartworms recovered at necropsy, were used to compare the different ICD methods.Of the ICD methods, the heat/EDTA technique was further evaluated using an additional 30 canine serum samples from dogs with adult heartworms at necropsy but having no or low levels of antigen when originally tested by the microtiter plate ELISA without ICD. To expand the population of samples without detectable heartworm antigen, canine serum samples from client-owned dogs (N&#160;=&#160;181) that were submitted to a commercial reference laboratory for routine heartworm testing were evaluated. Heartworm antigen was not detected in these samples by the microtiter plate ELISA in the absence of ICD.\nRetrospective analysis of field populations\nTo determine the frequency with which discrepant heartworm results are attributable to immune complexing of the antigen, heartworm test results from 1115 canine samples tested with and without the pepsin pretreatment method were analyzed. These samples had been submitted to IDEXX Laboratories between 2014 and 2016 for the investigation of discrepant heartworm test results. Specifically, results may have been inconsistent with clinical findings, or between different test methods (e.g., antigen vs microfilaria), or between different testing events (e.g., in-clinic vs reference laboratory).\nProspective evaluation of HW infected dogs\nTwelve dogs were recruited to evaluate the effect of administering a macrocyclic lactone and a 28-day course of doxycycline as pre-adulticide therapy on heartworm antigen levels. Private practices from Florida (n&#160;=&#160;7) and Louisiana (n&#160;=&#160;5) prospectively enrolled dogs with confirmed positive heartworm antigen test results and no history of having received heartworm prevention in the prior 4&#160;months. Dogs were prescribed an appropriate dose of a commercially available macrocyclic lactone and doxycycline (5&#8211;10&#160;mg/kg PO BID) from Day 0 to Day 28, prior to adulticide treatment. Serum samples were collected from the dogs on Days 0, 14, and 28 and tested for heartworm antigen before and after ICD treatment.\nResults\n\nEvaluation of ICD methods\nAll four ICD methods (heat/EDTA, pepsin, acidic, and heat) released heartworm antigen from immune complexes when the PPC was tested by microtiter plate ELISA. The methods required different minimum starting volumes of canine serum and plasma, however, to achieve the 100&#160;&#956;L sample volume required to perform the assay. A minimum starting sample volume of 100&#160;&#956;L was required for heat plus EDTA, 50&#160;&#956;L for pepsin or acidic, and 600&#160;&#956;L for heat (Table&#160;1).Table 1Various methods of immune complex dissociation and the minimum starting volume of canine serum or plasma needed to recover 100&#160;&#956;L for the heartworm antigen ELISA testReferenceMethodMinimum volume of sample required to recover 100&#160;&#956;L for testingReagents added to the sampleWeil [5]Heat + EDTA100&#160;&#956;L100&#160;&#956;L 0.1&#160;M EDTAIDEXX PetChek&#174; HW antigen testa\nPepsin50&#160;&#956;L35&#160;&#956;L S1 (acid)&#160;+&#160;35&#160;&#956;L S2 (base)Pokriefka [13] HIV antigen testAcidic pH50&#160;&#956;L35&#160;&#956;L S1 (acid)&#160;+&#160;35&#160;&#956;L S2 (base)Little [11]Heat600&#160;&#956;LNA\naThe sample is added to an enzyme-coated well of the microtiter plate from the PetChek&#174; HW antigen test kit.

Heartworm antigen was not detected using any of the four ICD methods in the sample from the dog negative for heartworms at necropsy. The serum samples from five dogs with necropsy-confirmed heartworm infections had no detectable (n&#160;=&#160;2) or low (n&#160;=&#160;3) levels of heartworm antigen in the absence of pretreatment but all samples became antigen positive following ICD by the four methods (Fig.&#160;2).Table 2Comparison of antigen detection with or without ICD using samples from necropsy-confirmed positive dogs and client-owned dogsDog populationNumber of positive resultsNo ICD treatmentICD treatmentHeat + EDTAPepsinAcidic pHHeatNecropsy-confirmed positive (1&#8211;2 female worms); n&#160;=&#160;535555Necropsy-confirmed positive (1&#8211;11 female worms); n&#160;=&#160;301729NDNDNDClient-owned (samples submitted to reference lab); n&#160;=&#160;18104NDNDND\nICD immune complex dissociation, ND not done\nFig. 2Comparison of immune complex dissociation methods for detection of heartworm antigen in samples from dogs with and without heartworm infections detected at necropsy\nBased on required sample volume, performance, and simplicity of the method, the heat/EDTA technique was further evaluated using a larger population of canine samples. Of the 30 samples from dogs with heartworms at necropsy (but with no or low antigen levels when originally tested), 17 samples that were originally positive retested as positive for heartworm antigen using the heat/EDTA method. Twelve samples that were originally negative for antigen became positive for heartworm antigen using the heat/EDTA method. One sample remained negative for heartworm antigen despite ICD pretreatment (Table 2). Of the 181 canine serum samples from client-owned dogs that were negative for heartworm antigen without ICD, 177 (98%) remained negative following ICD. Four (2%) samples converted from negative to positive following pretreatment of the sample with heat/EDTA.\nRetrospective analysis of field populations\nTo evaluate the frequency with which discrepant heartworm antigen test results are affected by immune complexing, results from 1115 samples submitted between 2014 and 2016 for the investigation of discrepant heartworm results were analyzed. Most samples (1003; 90%) produced the same result with and without the pepsin method of ICD. Specifically, 772 (69%) samples remained negative for heartworm antigen and 231 samples remained positive for heartworm antigen with and without ICD. Samples from 112 dogs (10%) negative for heartworm antigen without ICD tested positive following treatment with the pepsin ICD method.\nProspective evaluation of heartworm-infected dogs\nOf the 12 dogs enrolled with positive heartworm antigen results, serum samples from 9 dogs had high antigen levels (high ELISA OD) when tested with and without ICD at all time points (data not shown). Three dogs, however, demonstrated a measurable decrease in antigen levels while receiving pre-adulticide therapy (Fig.&#160;3). When Day 14 and Day 28 samples from these three dogs were tested without ICD treatment, the results were near the cut-off of the microtiter plate ELISA for heartworm antigen. These samples demonstrated enhanced detection of heartworm antigen following ICD treatment (Fig. 3).Fig. 3Heartworm antigen levels in serum samples from three dogs with low levels of antigen at diagnosis, shown with and without immune complex dissociation\n\nDiscussion\nOur study demonstrates that multiple methods are capable of dissociating circulating immune complexes containing heartworm antigen. The existence of immune complexes in heartworm-infected dogs has been known for some time [5, 15&#8211;17]. Diagnosis of other infectious diseases besides heartworm can have interference from immune complexes, such as the detection of p24 in HIV, circulating antigens in leishmaniasis, dengue, histoplasmosis, and others [13, 18&#8211;22]. Our study also demonstrates that the level of heartworm antigen detection by microtiter plate ELISA following ICD can vary by sample and by ICD method. A standardized ICD procedure is important to ensure the validity of the test results. A critical component of standardization is the inclusion of a pretreatment positive control, which confirms that the ICD method has been performed correctly each time a sample is tested. These standardized procedures and controls are not typically performed in-clinic but should be a part of reference laboratory protocols.A number of recent reports indicate that the presence of heartworm antigen&#8211;antibody immune complexes can interfere with antigen detection [6, 11, 14]. In one study, archived serum samples from dogs in animal shelters (N&#160;=&#160;165) that were negative for heartworm antigen were subsequently retested after heat treatment [14]. Following heat treatment, 11/154 samples (7.1%) became positive for heartworm antigen. This population primarily included dogs from an endemic area that were not receiving monthly heartworm prevention or other routine veterinary care. In our study, 10% of samples evaluated for discrepant heartworm test results demonstrated evidence of immune complexing that interfered with heartworm antigen detection. The full history on these cases was not available to document previous treatment or preventive use in these dogs. The frequency of false-negative heartworm test results due to immune complexes in both instances was higher than the 2% identified in the 181 serum samples from client-owned dogs reported in this study. Likewise, a recent study has demonstrated that dogs visiting a wellness care veterinary program had no false-negative test results for heartworm on their point-of-care screening tests due to immune complexes [23]. These results suggest that the frequency of immune complex&#8211;associated interference in heartworm test results is low in the population of well-cared-for-dogs but may be of concern in dogs with certain risk factors including inconsistent use of heartworm preventive products, administration of pre-adulticide type therapy or SK, and conditions associated with chronic immune stimulation. Therefore, methods of ICD are not appropriate for routine use in heartworm screening but may be valuable in cases in which heartworm infection is suspected and negative heartworm antigen results are obtained.Several leading veterinary specialty organizations like the American Heartworm Society, the Companion Animal Parasite Council, and the European Scientific Counsel Companion Animal Parasites discourage the use of SK, citing compliance failure, potential for selecting for resistance, and the persistence of worms in the pulmonary arteries and eventual development of pulmonary pathology during the SK treatment [3, 10, 24]. Nevertheless, some veterinarians use the SK treatment for certain dogs, particularly those owned by clients who cannot afford adulticide treatment or when the medical risk is high. Treatment of heartworm-infected dogs with a macrocyclic lactone at preventative dosages with or without doxycycline also may reduce free heartworm antigen in some dogs. McCall et al. reported that dogs with experimentally induced infections of D. immitis treated with 16 monthly preventive doses of ivermectin and pyrantel pamoate showed declining levels of antigen during the study. The dogs in that study had live worms at necropsy, suggesting that the SK treatment interfered with either antigen production by the surviving worms or with the detection of complexed antigen [2]. Using a commercial microtiter well-based assay, Drake et al. reported that 15 dogs treated monthly with a macrocyclic lactone and doxycycline became antigen negative within 24&#160;months [6]. Of the 15 dogs that were antigen negative by the initial assay, eight were found to be antigen positive following heating of the sample before re-testing. Therefore, dogs on SK treatment may be suitable candidates for ICD testing.The combined administration of a macrocyclic lactone and doxycycline has been shown to have both adulticidal and microfilaricidal effects [9]. Female worms recovered from dogs receiving this therapy demonstrated significant inhibition of oogenesis/embryogenesis of filariae and had a loss of uterine content. Likewise, dogs in this treatment group demonstrated a reduction in circulating heartworm antigen. Decreased antigen production by the female parasite and the potential for immune stimulation as parasites die may shift the ratio of antigen to antibody favoring antigen bound in immune complexes. Hence, there is a risk of false-negative test results after initiating therapy with a combination of a macrocyclic lactone and doxycycline. Therefore, it is important to confirm positive heartworm antigen test results by another testing protocol before initiating any type of therapy.\nConclusions\nThis study confirmed that multiple methods are effective for the dissociation of heartworm antigen from immune complexes. Some variability is evident across samples and methods, highlighting the importance of standardized protocols and controls to ensure reliable results. The heat/EDTA method as originally described by Weil et al. [5] is recommended due to ease of use, reliable performance with small sample volumes, and availability of reagents. Immune complexes were found to infrequently interfere with the performance of heartworm antigen tests in well-cared-for client-owned dogs. Therefore, ICD methods are not necessary for routine screening but should be considered when heartworm infection is suspected and antigen results are negative. This could also include dogs on SK or with chronic inflammation where antibody levels may exceed antigen concentration resulting in immune complex formation [6, 14]. Finally, this study identified a potential risk of false-negative test results in some dogs after initiating therapy with a combination of a macrocyclic lactone due to a reduction in detectable heartworm antigen levels that could only be recovered following ICD protocols.", "pmid": "29143646", "title": "Validation of immune complex dissociation methods for use with heartworm antigen tests", "journal_title": "Parasites & Vectors", "authors": "Melissa J.

For example, minimal collaterals such as Rentrop grade 1 collaterals were sometimes classified as non-significant collaterals. In addition, several studies did not exclude patients with patent IRA. In such studies, interpretation of the results were complicated and difficult because antegrade flow of IRA was likely to have counteracted with coronary collateral flow resulting in underestimation of collateral flow grades.13&#8211;17 Thus, comprehensive analyses in a large-scale cohort are now warranted so that investigators can evaluate the cardioprotective impacts of coronary collaterals in detail by selecting patients with completely occluded IRA.In the present study, we sought to investigate the impacts of acute phase coronary collaterals on in-hospital and 5-year mortality enrolling 3340 patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) with completely occluded IRA from the database of the Osaka Acute Coronary Insufficiency Study (OACIS), a prospective multicentre observational registry of patients with AMI in Japan.4\n19\nMethods\n\nStudy population\nWe used the OACIS database to investigate the prognostic impacts of acute phase coronary collaterals after STEMI. The OACIS is a prospective, multicentre observational study designed to collect and analyse demographic, procedural and outcome data in patients with AMI at 25 collaborating hospitals with cardiac emergency units. All the study participants were informed about data collection, blood sampling and genotyping, and provided written informed consent. The diagnosis of AMI was made on the basis of the WHO criteria, which required at least two of the following three criteria to be met: (1) clinical history of central chest pressure, pain or tightness lasting >30&#8197;min; (2) ST segment elevation >0.1&#8197;mV in at least one standard and (3) a rise in serum creatinine phosphokinase concentration to more than twice the normal laboratory value. All the collaborating hospitals were encouraged to enrol consecutive patients with AMI. We prospectively collected data by research cardiologists and trained research nurses using a specific reporting form, and the variables presented in Tables were extracted from the OACIS registry database in this study. The OACIS started in April 1998, and there were 8351 patients with STEMI as possible candidates for this study during the study period (figure 1). It is registered with the University Hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trials Registry (UMIN-CTR) in Japan (ID: UMIN000004575), and details are described elsewhere.4\n19This study included 3340 consecutive patients with STEMI who were registered with the OACIS between 1998 and 2010 and fulfilled the following criteria: (1) who underwent emergency coronary angiography within 24&#8197;hours after the onset, (2) complete occlusion of the IRA which means thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow grade 0, and (3) angiographic collateral flow was evaluated using the Rentrop collateral score (RCS) (figure 1).20\n21 That is, RCS-0 indicates no visible coronary collaterals; RCS-1, coronary collaterals without IRA filling; RCS-2, coronary collaterals with partial IRA filling; and RCS-3, collaterals with complete IRA filling.21The authors had full access to the data and take responsibility for their integrity. All authors have read and agree to the manuscript as written.\nStatistical analysis\nCategorical variables were compared by the &#967;2 test, and continuous variables were compared by the Kruskal-Wallis test. The impacts of coronary collaterals on in-hospital and 5-year mortality were assessed as ORs and their 95% CIs with a logistic regression analysis, and HRs and 95% CI with Cox regression analysis, respectively. To reduce the confounding effects of variations in patient backgrounds, multivariable analyses were employed where covariates were described in the footnote of each table. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate event rates, and the differences between RCS grades were assessed by the log-rank tests. To exclude the influence of stenosis of the supply artery and evaluate the impacts of coronary collaterals appropriately, the impacts of in-hospital and 5-year mortality were also evaluated in patients with single vessel disease of the main coronary arteries (left anterior descending, left circumflex and right coronary arteries) without previous MI as a subgroup analysis. Predictors of development of collaterals were assessed using univariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis. Missing data were not complemented, and patients with missing data were automatically excluded in the multivariable analyses. Statistical significance was set as p<0.05. All statistical analyses were performed using R software packages V.3.2.1 for Mac (R Development Core Team).\nResults\n\nBaseline characteristics and determinants of collaterals\nPatient characteristics, number of missing data and predictors of coronary collaterals are summarised in table 1, online supplementary table S1 and table 2, respectively. In general, patient backgrounds were significantly different among RCS grades in age, onset to admission hour, dyslipidaemia, previous MI, angina pectoris, culprit vessel, multivessel disease, emergency PCI, prescription rate of ACE inhibitors at discharge and angiotensin receptor blocker. In addition, median peak creatinine phosphokinase levels decreased as RCS increases (table 1).Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that younger age, longer time from the onset to admission, dyslipidaemia, history of angina pectoris, left anterior descending artery, right coronary artery and presence of multivessel disease were associated with presence of collaterals in this study (table 2).\nImpacts of coronary collaterals on in-hospital mortality\nAs shown in table 3, figure 2 and online supplementary figure S1, in-hospital mortalities were significantly lower in the RCS-1 and RCS-2 groups than in the RCS-0 group, whereas it was higher in the RCS-3 group than in the RCS-0 group. However, if we analyse the data only in patients with single vessel disease without previous MI, in-hospital mortality decreases as RCS grade increases (p=0.018). In multivariable logistic regression analysis, adjusted OR for in-hospital mortality were 0.48 (95% CI 0.22 to 0.94, p=0.046), 0.38 (0.17 to 0.76, p=0.010) and 1.35 (0.72 to 2.40, p=0.331) in the RCS-1, RCS-2 and RCS-3 groups, respectively.\nImpacts of coronary collaterals on 5-year mortality\nDuring a median follow-up duration of 1691&#8197;days (quartile 714&#8211;1824) from STEMI onset, 418 events occurred (306 in RCS-0, 39 in RCS-1, 38 in RCS-2 and 35 in RCS-3). Kaplan-Meier survival estimates are shown in figure 3. Patients with RCS-1 and RCS-2 collaterals showed significantly better 5-year survival than patients without coronary collaterals (RCS-0) or patients with RCS-3 collaterals (p<0.001). On the other hand, in a subgroup analysis, RCS-3 collaterals seemed to be associated with better survival in patients with single vessel disease without previous MI. In multivariable Cox regression analysis, adjusted HR for 5-year mortality were 0.53 (95% CI 0.34 to 0.82, p=0.004), 0.46 (0.30 to 0.70, p<0.001) and 0.98 (0.65 to 1.48, p=0.920) in the RCS-1, RCS-2 and RCS-3 groups, respectively (table 4). These trends were also suggested in all subgroups with exceptions in female patients and patients with single vessel disease where RCS-3 tended to impact favourably on 5-year mortality as compared to other subgroups (figure 4).\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we investigated the impacts of acute phase coronary collaterals on in-hospital and long-term (5-year) mortality after STEMI in the contemporary PCI era enrolling 3340 patients with an occluded IRA. This study is one of the largest studies investigating the prognostic impacts of coronary collaterals published until now.16 We revealed that RCS-1 and RCS-2 collaterals were associated with better in-hospital mortality (adjusted OR of RCS-1 is 0.48 with p=0.046, and RCS-2 is 0.38 with p=0.010) and 5-year mortality (adjusted HR of RCS-1 is 0.53 with p=0.004, and RCS-2 is 0.46 with p<0.001) as compared with RCS-0, whereas presence of RCS-3 collaterals were not associated with improved in-hospital (p=0.331) and 5-year mortality (p=0.920). Since subgroup analysis of single vessel disease without the previous MI population showed that in-hospital mortality and 5-year mortality tend to decrease as RCS grade increases (figures 2 and 3), we hypothesised that the cardioprotective impact of coronary collaterals would increase along with an increments of angiographical collateral filling (RCS-0 to RCS-3), but that worse clinical profiles in patients with RCS-3 may have masked the mortality benefit of coronary collaterals (table 1).Our results of the acute phase cardioprotective effect and determinants of the presence of coronary collaterals were consistent with previously published data. For example median peak creatinine phosphokinase levels decreased as RCS increases (p<0.001) in this study, suggesting the acute cardioprotective effects of acute phase coronary collaterals (table 1).6\n7\n12 In fact, in-hospital mortality decreases as RCS grade increases in patients with single vessel disease without previous MI. This is consistent with the previously published data which suggested the association between presence of coronary collaterals and lower in-hospital mortality.11 Determinants of the presence of coronary collaterals in this study were younger age, longer time from the onset to admission, clinical history of angina pectoris, culprit vessel and presence of multivessel disease, which were also consistent with the previously published data.1\n4\n11\n13\n14Furthermore, we believe that our data gave us new insights into the impacts of acute phase coronary collaterals in patients with STEMI. First, the presence of angiographically minimal coronary collaterals, defined as RCS-1, was even associated with better in-hospital and 5-year mortalities as compared with the absence of coronary collaterals (RCS-0). Thus, it is suggested that classifying patients with RCS-0 and RCS-1 together as a non-significant collateral group was inappropriate to assess the impacts of coronary collaterals, although many previous studies have investigated impacts of coronary collaterals thus.12\n14\n16 The second important finding of our study was that angiographically significant coronary collaterals (RCS-3) were not associated with better in-hospital and 5-year mortalities in the overall study population. However, since subgroup analysis of single vessel disease without previous MI revealed that RCS-3 was associated with the lowest in-hospital mortality and better 5-year mortality (figures 2B and 3B), it is conceivable that worse clinical profiles in patients with RCS-3 masked the mortality benefit of RCS-3 coronary collaterals. Thus, our observations clearly demonstrated that impacts of RCS-0, RCS-1, RCS-2 and RCS-3 should be evaluated separately to accurately assess the prognostic impacts of coronary collaterals, under the consideration of the patient's clinical background.Recently, therapeutic promotion of coronary collateral growth is considered as a valuable treatment strategy for ischaemic heart disease and potential benefits of this therapy have been intensively investigated.22&#8211;24 The rationale of this approach is mainly based on the short-term beneficial impact of coronary collaterals.22\n23 In addition to this, our study also suggested the long-term benefits of coronary collaterals in patients with STEMI, which are consistent with the recent evidence demonstrating the long-term favourable impact of coronary collaterals in stable coronary artery disease.16\n25 Thus, we believe that our result may make the clinical implication such as therapeutic angiogenesis more anticipating.\nStudy limitations\nThere are several limitations that warrant mention. First, this study included only patients who were able to visit hospitals within 24&#8197;hours after STEMI onset, and who could undergo emergent coronary angiography which revealed complete occlusion of IRA (TIMI grade 0); therefore, there could be a selection bias in this study and it is not clear whether identical conclusions can be drawn for all patients with STEMI. However, we speculated that this process made it possible to assess the impact of coronary collaterals more accurately than enrolling all study population. Second, the study end point was set as all-cause mortality and one-third causes of all death events were not clearly determined. Third, collateral functionalities were not assessed with flow wires because that was not a prespecified purpose of the OACIS registry. These might lead to biased results. Thus, caution is required in interpretation of our results.\nConclusions\nPresence of acute phase coronary collaterals was associated with better in-hospital and 5-year mortality after STEMI in the contemporary PCI era, if its angiographical coronary filling was minimal or moderate. However, it should be underlined that patients with angiographically significant collaterals (RCS-3) were characterised by worse baseline clinical backgrounds, and thus not necessarily associated with better survival. The benefit of acute phase coronary collaterals should be evaluated in combination with patient clinical backgrounds.", "pmid": "27412101", "title": "Impact of coronary collaterals on in-hospital and 5-year mortality after ST-elevation myocardial infarction in the contemporary percutaneous coronary intervention era: a prospective observational study", "journal_title": "BMJ Open", "authors": "Masahiko Hara;Yasuhiko Sakata;Daisaku Nakatani;Shinichiro Suna;Masami Nishino;Hiroshi Sato;Tetsuhisa Kitamura;Shinsuke Nanto;Masatsugu Hori;Issei Komuro", "doi": "10.1136/bmjopen-2016-011105", "score": "0.017251663"}, {"keywords": "Hyperandrogenism;ovarian volume;polycystic ovaries;thecal hyperechogenicity", "abstract": "Objectives:\nTo study ovarian morphology by ultrasound in women with or without polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and to establish cut-off values of these parameters in Indian women with PCOS.Materials and Methods:\nA total of 119 consecutive women diagnosed PCOS and 77 apparently healthy women were enrolled.

Hence, PCOS is not merely a gynecological condition, but a systemic endocrinopathy with elevated risk of dyslipidemia, [2] hypertension, cardiovascular disease [3] insulin resistance, [4] glucose intolerance [5] and some cancers. [6] With the advent of clinical USG in 1980's and the ability to directly visualize the ovarian architecture researchers have included USG as an important diagnostic criterion. Popularity of USG is owing to a paradigm shift from purely clinical (i.e., NIH 1990) [7] to the combination of clinical and sonographic criteria as by Rotterdam 2003 [8] or androgen excess-polycystic ovary syndrome (AE-PCOS) 2006. The first widely accepted definition of polycystic ovaries (PCO) on transabdominal ultrasound (TAS) was proposed by Swanson et al. [9] as enlarged and rounded ovaries with a mean volume of 12 mL and containing an increased number of small follicles (2-8 mm). Subsequently, Adams et al. [10] proposed echogenic ovarian stroma apart from increased number (>10) of peripherally arranged follicles, measuring 2-8 mm in diameter. These criteria have been widely used even in the era of transvaginal ultrasound (TVS), which is currently considered the gold standard. Recently, Robert et al. [11] have pointed out that size is not as important as ovarian morphology and even proposed the upper limit of ovarian volume as 5.5 mL. However, TVS and TAS studies in asymptomatic volunteers have demonstrated that PCO can be seen in up to 20% of women of reproductive age group [12] and the clinical significance of PCO in these asymptomatic women is unclear. There is a particular difficulty in USG diagnosis in adolescents where TVS is not feasible and follicle size has less significance and therefore researchers. [13] There is scarce data published from India on the ovarian morphology in women with PCOS. Sikka et al. [14] correlated hormonal and insulin sensitivity parameters with TVS findings of PCO in 100 anovulatory infertile women, but they did not include a control group.We planned to study the sonographic morphology of ovaries in Indian PCOS women for comparison with Rotterdam 2003 criteria and thereby establish cut-off values for PCO. (Ovarian size and number, and size of follicles, stromal echogenicity).\nM\n\nSubjects\nAll women presenting with complaints of menstrual disturbances, male pattern hair growth or infertility to Endocrine and Gynecology clinics of our Institute between July 2011 and December 2012, were informed and asked to participate in the study. A total of 119 consecutive women who had signed an informed consent and qualified NIH 1990 [7] criteria for diagnosis of PCOS (n = 119, cases) were recruited for the study. Oligoamenorrhea was defined as the absence of menstruation for &#8805;35 days or 6 months. Clinical hyperandrogenism was identified by modified Ferriman-Gallwey (FG) score &#8805;8, [15] with or without acne and/or androgenic alopecia. The study was approved from the Institute Ethics Committee.\nControls\nSeventy seven age-matched apparently healthy non-pregnant women with normal menstrual cycles acted as controls. These women also consented to participate in the study and were selected from health awareness camps done in University students or from hospital staff. None of them received any medications including steroids androgens, OCP's, etc., especially hormonal treatment and none had hirsutism or acne. Three of these control subjects were found to have PCO and were excluded from the study.\nMethods\nAnthropometric measurements such as weight, height, waist and hip circumference were measured using standard calibrated digital weighing scale, stadiometer and nonexpendable inch tape. TAS examinations were conducted using a 3 MHz transabdominal transducer (LogiqP6) between 4th and 11th day of the cycle. Random TAS examination was performed in the amenorrheic women. For ultrasound assessment of ovarian morphology, the methodology described by Balen et al. [16] was followed. Follicular size was measured, according to the method described by Pache et al. [17] Echogenicity was scored as normal (=1), moderately increased (=2), on markedly increased (=3). [18] The volume of the ovary was calculated with the formula of ellipse: '1/2 (A &#215; B &#215; C), where A is the longitudinal diameter, B is the anteroposterior diameter; and C is the transverse diameter of the ovary. [19] The intra observer variation checked on cohort was < 6.0%.\nInvestigations\nBaseline fasting serum samples were collected in all subjects for estimation of biochemical (glucose, lipids and liver and kidney functions) and hormonal (PRL, TSH, T4, Cortisol, LH, FSH, 17-OHP, total testosterone and insulin) parameters. The samples for LH, FSH, total testosterone and 17-OHP were collected on days 3-7th (early follicular phase) of spontaneous or medroxy-progesterone induced (in amenorrheic patients) menstrual cycle. Fasting plasma insulin samples were immediately separated in cold centrifuge and stored at &#8722;70&#176;C until the assay.\nAssays\nHormone estimation was carried out using electrochemiluminescence (Cobas e411, Roche Diagnostics Limited, Charles Avenue, Burgess Hill and West Sussex). The intra and inter-assay coefficients of variation for these were <7.2% and <6.0% respectively. Plasma glucose, lipids, liver and kidney functions were performed on Hitachi 912, Japan using the standard commercial kits.\nStatistical analysis\nData was analyzed using (StataCorp LP, 4905 Lakeway Drive, College Station, Texas 77845-4512, USA) and t-test was used to compare the averages of volume, number of follicles and size between the groups. ROC analysis was used to find out the cut-off values of various parameters (ovarian volume, follicular number and follicular size) for diagnosis of PCOS and sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) were calculated with 95% confidence interval for each of these parameters singly and in combination.\nR\nThe mean age of PCOS subjects was 26.7 &#177; 4.23 (16-42) versus 27.3 &#177; 4.91 (18-43) years among controls (P > 0.05). The mean body mass index (BMI) of cases and controls was also comparable (27.76 &#177; 3.1 vs. 26.22 &#177; 3.2 kg/m2; P > 0.05). Among the cases, irregular menstrual cycles were seen in 49.5% (59/119) with the menstrual cycle length of 36-99 days (median length of 76 days), hirsutism in 69.7% (83/119) with FG score ranging from 8 to 30, obesity in 48.4% (58/119) with BMI ranging from 25.5 to 33.2 kg/m2 , various grades of acne vulgaris in 37.8% (45/119) and infertility in 66.67% (32 out of 48 patients who were married). For purposes of brevity, biochemical and hormonal parameters are not presented here and have been partly reported elsewhere. [202122]There was no significant difference in ovarian volume, follicle number, follicular size and stromal echogenicity between the ovaries in the same subject, barring two patients in whom the disease was unilateral. Therefore, averaged values of both ovaries were used for statistical analysis in control as well as PCOS women, except in two patients with unilateral disease. The distribution of mean follicle size, number of follicles and mean ovarian volume in patients with PCOS and control subjects is depicted in Figure 1.Median ovarian volume was 11 mL in PCOS women and 5.75 mL in controls (P < 0.01). Similarly, median values for follicle size and number were 3.9 mm and 13 in PCOS women versus 7 mm and 5 in controls (P < 0.01). The volume of ovaries in control subjects was never greater than 10.2 mL; the maximum number of follicles in control ovaries was 10. Ovarian stromal echogenicity was markedly increased in 65 (54.6%), moderately increased in 50 (42.01%) and was normal in only 4 PCOS women (0.034%). The difference between stromal echogenicity in PCOS and control women was statistically significant (P < 0.01) as it was normal in all control subjects.Since there is a lot of overlap between the PCOS and control women in the values of ovarian volume, follicular size and number, a single parameter cannot be used to differentiate polycystic and normal ovaries. Sensitivity of 79.49% and specificity of 90.67% was achieved when an ovarian volume of 8 mL was taken as cut-off to distinguish between PCOS and control women, correctly classifying 83.85% of PCOS cases. Sensitivity of 76.42% and specificity of 91.16% with corresponding PPV of 90.10% and NPV 78.2% was achieved with an ovarian volume cut-off of 10 mL. On raising the cut-off to 12 mL, the sensitivity reached to 74.56% and specificity to 93.31%. Using cut-off value of 9 follicles per ovary to distinguish between PCOS patients and control subjects yielded a sensitivity of 82.35%, specificity of 92.0% with a PPV of 88.4% and NPV of 75.23%, which correctly classified 86.08% of PCOS patients. Accordingly taking a cut-off value of 10 and 12 follicles per ovary to distinguish between PCOS patients and control subjects yielded a sensitivity of 78.41% and 80.34%, specificity of 92.91% and 93.11%, respectively. Follicular size was the least useful indicator when used alone and a cut-off value of 5 mm yielded a sensitivity of 74.67%, specificity of 78.15% and correctly classified 76.8% of PCOS patients.However, it is relatively easy to correctly classify subjects as PCOS or normal, when a combination of parameters is used. When all the three criteria (ovarian volume, follicle size and follicle number) were used, a sensitivity of 85.59% and specificity of 90.54% was achieved with a PPV of 93.52%, NPV of 79.76% and diagnostic accuracy of 87.5%. With the combination of two (ovarian volume and follicular number) or all three components of ovarian morphology, a sensitivity of 87.39% and specificity of 87.84% was achieved with 92.04% PPV, 81.25% NPV and diagnostic accuracy of 87.56%. Using two or three criteria in combination improved sensitivity and additional patients were diagnosed alike since follicular size yielded lower sensitivity and specificity when used for diagnosis of PCOS [Table 1].\nD\nSince the paradigm shift from purely clinical (NIH 1990) to inclusion of USG in combination with clinical criteria by Rotterdam 2003 and AE-PCOS 2006, it becomes imperative to distinguish PCO from multi-follicular ovaries. [78] The latter condition is known to have larger (up to 10 mm in diameter) and fewer (up to 6 in each ovary) cysts, without hypertrophic echogenic stroma. [10] According to The Rotterdam European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology/American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ESHRE/ASRM)-Sponsored PCOS Consensus Workshop Group of 2004, [8] PCO is one of the three components. PCO on USG is defined as &#8220;presence of >12 follicles of 2-9 mm in each ovary and/or increased ovarian volume (>10 mL).&#8221; The definition was based on studies conducted by Pache et al. [23] van Santbrink et al. [24] and Jonard et al. [25] In our study, the volume of ovaries in control subjects was never greater than 10.2 mL; the maximum number of follicles in control ovaries was 10. A cut-off value of 8 mL ovarian volume correctly classified 83.85% of PCOS patients with a sensitivity of 79.49% and specificity of 90.67%. Although there was an overlap between PCOS and control ovaries, a cut-off value of 9 follicles to distinguish between PCOS patients and control subjects yielded a sensitivity of 82.35%, specificity of 92.0% and correctly classified 86.08% of PCOS patients. However, in the present study, 6 control women had an ovarian follicular number of 10. Nearly, 100% specificity was achieved when the cut-off for the number of follicles was 19 and for ovarian volume was 16 mL.In a study on Indian population by Sikka et al., [14] a 100% PPV of the ovarian follicle number of 10 was described for insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism. Also, all patients in that study had an ovarian volume of more than 10 mL, whereas in our study, a significant number of patients with PCOS had volumes less than 10 mL [Figure 1a]. These results may not be applicable in discriminating normal from PCOS women as this study did not include a control group. Our findings highlight that the ESHRE/ASRM cut-off values are not reproducible in Indian women and this fact has been reported by many other investigators for other populations. [262728] All our sonographic findings were recorded by a single observer, removing the confounder of inter observer variability as has been reported earlier by Amer et al. [29] and Lujan et al. [30] Despite limitations of the present study (i.e., the parameters are obtained with TAS and no correlation was carried out with insulin resistance and hormones levels), this is the first Indian study evaluating PCO morphology. As TVS is not practicable in unmarried women, our study may pave the way for new studies with TAS to define the cut-off values for these parameters.We conclude that the results of sonographic morphology of ovaries raises the concern that large number of PCOS women fall outside the standard definition of PCOS and highlight the need to develop more reliable and accurate ultrasound criteria for diagnosis of PCOS. Besides, it supports the concept that using two or three sonographic criteria in combination improve the sensitivity.", "pmid": "24741513", "title": "Comparative evaluation of sonographic ovarian morphology of Indian women with polycystic ovary syndrome versus those of normal women", "journal_title": "Indian Journal of Endocrinology and Metabolism", "authors": "Sanjeed Ahmed;Shivani Pahwa;Chandan Jyoti Das;Farooq A Mir;Sobia Nisar;Majid Jehangir;Shameem Parveen;Aafia Rashid;Mohd Ashraf Ganie", "doi": "10.4103/2230-8210.129108", "score": "0.016436758"}, {"keywords": "", "abstract": "SummaryBackground\nWHO is developing a global strategy towards eliminating cervical cancer as a public health problem, which proposes an elimination threshold of four cases per 100&#8200;000 women and includes 2030 triple-intervention coverage targets for scale-up of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination to 90%, twice-lifetime cervical screening to 70%, and treatment of pre-invasive lesions and invasive cancer to 90%. We assessed the impact of achieving the 90&#8211;70&#8211;90 triple-intervention targets on cervical cancer mortality and deaths averted over the next century. We also assessed the potential for the elimination initiative to support target 3.4 of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)&#8212;a one-third reduction in premature mortality from non-communicable diseases by 2030.Methods\nThe WHO Cervical Cancer Elimination Modelling Consortium (CCEMC) involves three independent, dynamic models of HPV infection, cervical carcinogenesis, screening, and precancer and invasive cancer treatment. Reductions in age-standardised rates of cervical cancer mortality in 78 low-income and lower-middle-income countries (LMICs) were estimated for three core scenarios: girls-only vaccination at age 9 years with catch-up for girls aged 10&#8211;14 years; girls-only vaccination plus once-lifetime screening and cancer treatment scale-up; and girls-only vaccination plus twice-lifetime screening and cancer treatment scale-up. Vaccination was assumed to provide 100% lifetime protection against infections with HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58, and to scale up to 90% coverage in 2020. Cervical screening involved HPV testing at age 35 years, or at ages 35 years and 45 years, with scale-up to 45% coverage by 2023, 70% by 2030, and 90% by 2045, and we assumed that 50% of women with invasive cervical cancer would receive appropriate surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy by 2023, which would increase to 90% by 2030. We summarised results using the median (range) of model predictions.Findings\nIn 2020, the estimated cervical cancer mortality rate across all 78 LMICs was 13&#183;2 (range 12&#183;9&#8211;14&#183;1) per 100&#8200;000 women. Compared to the status quo, by 2030, vaccination alone would have minimal impact on cervical cancer mortality, leading to a 0&#183;1% (0&#183;1&#8211;0&#183;5) reduction, but additionally scaling up twice-lifetime screening and cancer treatment would reduce mortality by 34&#183;2% (23&#183;3&#8211;37&#183;8), averting 300&#8200;000 (300&#8200;000&#8211;400&#8200;000) deaths by 2030 (with similar results for once-lifetime screening). By 2070, scaling up vaccination alone would reduce mortality by 61&#183;7% (61&#183;4&#8211;66&#183;1), averting 4&#183;8 million (4&#183;1&#8211;4&#183;8) deaths. By 2070, additionally scaling up screening and cancer treatment would reduce mortality by 88&#183;9% (84&#183;0&#8211;89&#183;3), averting 13&#183;3 million (13&#183;1&#8211;13&#183;6) deaths (with once-lifetime screening), or by 92&#183;3% (88&#183;4&#8211;93&#183;0), averting 14&#183;6 million (14&#183;1&#8211;14&#183;6) deaths (with twice-lifetime screening). By 2120, vaccination alone would reduce mortality by 89&#183;5% (86&#183;6&#8211;89&#183;9), averting 45&#183;8 million (44&#183;7&#8211;46&#183;4) deaths. By 2120, additionally scaling up screening and cancer treatment would reduce mortality by 97&#183;9% (95&#183;0&#8211;98&#183;0), averting 60&#183;8 million (60&#183;2&#8211;61&#183;2) deaths (with once-lifetime screening), or by 98&#183;6% (96&#183;5&#8211;98&#183;6), averting 62&#183;6 million (62&#183;1&#8211;62&#183;8) deaths (with twice-lifetime screening). With the WHO triple-intervention strategy, over the next 10 years, about half (48% [45&#8211;55]) of deaths averted would be in sub-Saharan Africa and almost a third (32% [29&#8211;34]) would be in South Asia; over the next 100 years, almost 90% of deaths averted would be in these regions. For premature deaths (age 30&#8211;69 years), the WHO triple-intervention strategy would result in rate reductions of 33&#183;9% (24&#183;4&#8211;37&#183;9) by 2030, 96&#183;2% (94&#183;3&#8211;96&#183;8) by 2070, and 98&#183;6% (96&#183;9&#8211;98&#183;8) by 2120.Interpretation\nThese findings emphasise the importance of acting immediately on three fronts to scale up vaccination, screening, and treatment for pre-invasive and invasive cervical cancer. In the next 10 years, a one-third reduction in the rate of premature mortality from cervical cancer in LMICs is possible, contributing to the realisation of the 2030 UN SDGs. Over the next century, successful implementation of the WHO elimination strategy would reduce cervical cancer mortality by almost 99% and save more than 62 million women's lives.Funding\nWHO, UNDP, UN Population Fund, UNICEF&#8211;WHO&#8211;World Bank Special Program of Research, Development and Research Training in Human Reproduction, Germany Federal Ministry of Health, National Health and Medical Research Council Australia, Centre for Research Excellence in Cervical Cancer Control, Canadian Institute of Health Research, Compute Canada, and Fonds de recherche du Qu&#233;bec&#8211;Sant&#233;.", "body": "Introduction\nIn 2018, an estimated 570&#8200;000 cases of cervical cancer were diagnosed, and 311&#8200;000 women died from the disease.1 Although cervical cancer has been relatively well controlled for several decades in many high-income countries, mainly because of cervical screening initiatives and effective cancer treatment services, it remains the most common cause of cancer-related death among women in 42 countries, most of which are low-income and lower-middle-income countries (LMICs).2Prophylactic vaccines against oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) have been available in most high-income countries from 2006 onwards. First-generation vaccines directly protect against oncogenic HPV types 16 and 18 in individuals naive for those types, and these HPV types are responsible for approximately 70% of invasive cervical cancers.3, 4 More recently, broader-spectrum protection against the types responsible for up to 90% of cervical cancers has been shown either via direct protection against a larger proportion of types (second-generation 9-valent vaccine) or via cross-protection against non-vaccine included types (bivalent vaccine).5, 6 However, because vaccines are primarily targeted at pre-adolescents or young adolescents, it is expected to take several decades after deployment in a population before their full benefits in terms of cancer prevention are realised, and a substantial impact of vaccines on cervical cancer incidence or mortality outcomes is yet to be observed. To date, vaccine coverage in LMICs has been low overall, with an estimated 3% of the primary targeted population of young girls in less developed regions vaccinated by 2014.7 By 2016, only 14% of LMICs had established vaccination programmes.8Research in contextEvidence before this studyMost low-income and lower-middle-income countries (LMICs) do not have access to human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination, cervical screening programmes are unavailable or poorly implemented, and population-level access to cancer treatment services is variable. WHO, with its partners, is developing a global strategy towards the elimination of cervical cancer as a public health problem. The draft strategy involves triple-intervention targets for scale-up of vaccination, screening, and precancer treatment and invasive cancer treatment and palliative care in all countries; these targets, known as the 90&#8211;70&#8211;90 WHO triple-intervention strategy, specify 90% coverage of HPV vaccination, 70% coverage of twice-lifetime screening with HPV testing (or a similarly high sensitivity test), and 90% of women having access to cervical precancer and cancer treatment and palliative care services, by 2030. In the accompanying Article published in The Lancet, the WHO Cervical Cancer Elimination Modelling Consortium (CCEMC) predicted the impact of various HPV vaccination and screening and precancer treatment strategies on cervical cancer incidence in 78 LMICs. The analysis found that cervical cancer elimination by 2120 at a threshold of four cases per 100&#8200;000 women-years was possible in all 78 LMICs if girls-only vaccination was combined with twice-lifetime screening. The results suggested that elimination was consistently achievable, and the number of cervical cancer cases averted maximised, only if vaccination was combined with twice-lifetime cervical screening and with appropriate treatment for women found to have cervical precancer. The CCEMC harnesses three independent, extensively peer-reviewed models: Policy1-Cervix (Cancer Council NSW, Sydney, NSW Australia), Harvard (Harvard University, Boston, MA, USA), and HPV-ADVISE (Laval University, Quebec, QC, Canada). In this analysis, the models projected the reductions in cervical cancer mortality over time by use of standardised scenarios determined via consultations at various WHO technical expert, advisory group, and global stakeholder meetings.Added value of this studyThis analysis of the impact of the WHO triple-intervention cervical cancer elimination strategy on mortality outcomes shows that, in the next 10 years, achieving substantial reductions in mortality will require successful scale-up of cancer diagnostic and treatment services in LMICs, including pathology, surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy; supportive and palliative care services will also need to be scaled up. If this is done, the 2030 UN Sustainable Development Goal of achieving a greater than one-third reduction in premature mortality from non-communicable diseases could be realised for cervical cancer. In the next 50 years, cervical screening and vaccination will both have an important role. The triple-intervention strategy would result in mortality rate reductions of 92% by 2070, increasing to almost 99% over the course of the next century as the full benefits of vaccination of young cohorts are realised over time.Implications of all the available evidenceImplementing the 90&#8211;70&#8211;90 WHO triple-intervention strategy to achieve cervical cancer elimination will result in more than 74 million cervical cancer cases averted and more than 62 million women's lives saved over the course of the next century. These findings have informed the draft WHO global strategy for cervical cancer elimination, which will be presented to the WHO Executive Board in February, 2020, and thereafter considered at the World Health Assembly in May, 2020.Many high-income countries are transitioning, or considering transitioning, from cervical cytology to primary HPV testing for cervical screening, which is generally a more effective and cost-effective approach to screening.9, 10, 11 Initiatives for both HPV vaccination and screening have been introduced in the context of broad access to diagnostic, precancer treatment, cancer treatment, and supportive and palliative care services in high-income countries, and the combination of early detection via screening and effective treatment with surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy has meant that net 5-year survival for cervical cancer is around 60&#8211;70% or greater in several high-income countries.12 However, in LMICs, uptake of cervical screening has been low and inconsistent, and population-level access to cancer care is generally poor. As a consequence of these differentials in access to cervical screening and treatment, the majority of deaths (91%) from cervical cancer currently occur in LMICs and upper-middle-income countries, and 60% of deaths are in LMICs.1 Access to supportive and palliative care services for people in LMICs is poor,13 and thus the majority of women dying from cervical cancer do so with little or no supportive care or pain relief.In May, 2018, the Director-General of WHO announced a call to action to eliminate cervical cancer as a public health problem, and in January, 2019, the WHO Executive Board requested that a draft global strategy to achieve elimination be developed. The draft global strategy being developed by WHO, with its partners, includes triple-intervention targets for scale-up of vaccination, screening, precancer treatment, and invasive cancer treatment in all countries; these targets specify 90% coverage of HPV vaccination, 70% coverage of twice-lifetime screening, and 90% access to cervical precancer and cancer treatment services and palliative care, by 2030.14 To inform the strategic planning process, the WHO Cervical Cancer Elimination Modelling Consortium (CCEMC) was formed and has done comparative modelling of potential intervention scenarios in all 78 LMICs. In the accompanying Article published in The Lancet,15 CCEMC predictions of the impact of HPV vaccination, screening, and precancer treatment strategies on cervical cancer incidence and cases averted are presented; the analysis found that elimination by 2120 at a threshold of four cases per 100&#8200;000 women was possible in all 78 LMICs if girls-only vaccination was combined with twice-lifetime screening. This strategy was predicted to reduce age-standardised incidence across 78 LMICs by 97% and to avert more than 74 million cervical cancer cases over the next century.15 The analysis concluded that adding screening with high uptake to vaccination will expedite reductions in cervical cancer incidence and the number of cases averted, and will be necessary to eliminate cervical cancer in countries with the highest burden.The aims of the current analysis were to model cancer treatment scale-up in addition to HPV vaccination and cervical screening and to assess the impact of achieving the 90&#8211;70&#8211;90 triple-intervention targets on cervical cancer mortality and deaths averted over the next century on the path to elimination. The cervical cancer elimination initiative has been framed within the context of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to support the realisation of SDG target 3.4&#8212;a one-third reduction in premature mortality from non-communicable diseases by 2030.16 Therefore, we also assessed the potential for the cervical cancer elimination strategy to deliver a one-third reduction in premature mortality from cervical cancer by 2030.\nMethods\n\nCountries included in the analysis\nThe 78 LMICs considered were located in six regions according to World Bank definitions: east Asia and Pacific, Europe and central Asia, Latin America and Caribbean, north Africa and the Middle East, South Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa (see the appendix pp 44&#8211;45 for the full list of countries within each region and the grouping of countries by income level).\nDescription of the WHO CCEMC models\nThe WHO CCEMC comprised three modelling groups collaborating with WHO and the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). The platforms were independent dynamic models, identified by WHO by use of predefined criteria. The modelling methods have been previously described.15 In brief, the selected models for the analysis explicitly considered the dynamic transmission of HPV infection (and could thus capture the effects of herd immunity); were capable of projecting the impact of HPV vaccination, cervical screening, and precancer treatment and clinical and screen-detected cancer treatment scale-up at a country level for all 78 LMICs considered; and were independently developed and have been extensively validated and peer reviewed. Three models were selected: Policy1-Cervix (Cancer Council NSW, Sydney, NSW, Australia), Harvard (Harvard University, Boston, MA, USA), and HPV-ADVISE (Laval University, Quebec, QC, Canada). The individual CCEMC models have been previously used to inform national policy on cervical screening and HPV vaccination in Australia, Canada, the UK, and the USA, and at the global level.10, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 The structure of the CCEMC models and the comparative modelling approach were endorsed by the WHO Advisory Committee on Immunization and Vaccines related Implementation Research (IVIR-AC).23HPV transmission and cervical carcinogenesis are modelled for the oncogenic HPV types included in second-generation vaccines (HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58) and other oncogenic types, and each model simulates the type-specific natural history of cervical cancer from persistent HPV infection to cervical cancer via high-grade precancerous cervical lesions (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grades 2 [CIN2] and 3 [CIN3]). All models can simulate complex cervical screening and treatment algorithms, and for the current analysis these models were adapted to incorporate country-level assumptions about the proportion of women receiving cervical cancer treatment and the consequent survival outcomes. Reporting was done according to a consensus-based framework for modelled evaluations of HPV prevention and cervical cancer control: HPV-FRAME.24 See the appendix (pp 50&#8211;56, 74&#8211;76) for a detailed description of the model platforms and HPV-FRAME reporting.\nStatus quo assumptions\nThe comparator (status quo) S0 scenario assumed no scale-up of vaccination, cervical screening, or cancer treatment. Under the status quo, it was assumed that none of the 78 LMICs had achieved substantial vaccination coverage by 2020, although in practice a few countries, such as Rwanda, have initiated high-coverage vaccination initiatives within the past few years. Thus, our analysis only captures the effect of scaled-up vaccination from 2020 onwards. For cervical screening, modelling groups made different assumptions about whether the impact of limited existing screening coverage was considered in the status quo (see the appendix pp 50&#8211;56 for further details).Treatment for cervical cancer involves stage-appropriate multimodality therapies with radiotherapy and chemotherapy, with surgery (partial or total hysterectomy) being an important option for early-stage disease. Cervical cancer clinical staging was based on the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) system. Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) sub-regional-level estimates for the stage distribution of invasive cervical cancer at diagnosis, and data on 5-year and 10-year survival rates were derived from systematic reviews done by WHO based on peer-reviewed publications and national reports including cancer control plans, cross-referenced to data from IARC cancer registries. Radiotherapy access, estimated as machine density per 1000 patients with cancer, was used as a surrogate for multimodal treatment delivery. We used 2018 data for radiotherapy access and availability of external beam radiation therapy and personnel (radiation oncologists, medical physicists, and radiation therapy technologists) provided by the International Atomic Energy Agency's Directory of Radiotherapy Centres (DIRAC). Ranges of treatment access rates in each World Bank region encompassed the lowest and the highest treatment access rates of the countries in each region and represented the percentage of the population that could potentially be served with the equipment and workforce available (table 1). These data were then used to derive initial estimates of country-level current status quo stage distributions, treatment access rates, and survival rates (appendix pp 63&#8211;70). We used these data as an initial (pre-calibration) input to the models.Table 1Summary of treatment assumptions by region for status quo scenario: FIGO stage distributions, stage-specific survival rates, and treatment access ratesStage distribution at diagnosisOverall 5-year (and 10-year) survival ratesTreatment access rate (range)*Stage 1Stage 2Stage 3&#8211;4AStage 4BStage 1Stage 2Stage 3&#8211;4AStage 4BEast Asia and Pacific23%39%27%11%65% (15%)51% (13%)15% (10%)2% (2%)17% (0&#8211;37)Europe and central Asia34%19%28%19%74% (42%)62% (37%)34% (28%)6% (4%)48% (18&#8211;100)Latin America and Caribbean23%26%46%5%73% (39%)61% (34%)32% (26%)6% (4%)44% (0&#8211;77)North Africa and Middle East13%43%31%13%80% (59%)69% (52%)46% (39%)9% (6%)67% (0&#8211;100)South Asia13%36%40%11%74% (42%)62% (37%)34% (28%)6% (4%)48% (0&#8211;55)Sub-Saharan Africa8%36%48%8%62% (6%)47% (5%)9% (4%)1% (1%)7% (0&#8211;37)This table provides a regional summary of the data used as an initial (pre-calibration) input to the models; however, each modelling group also applied a quality factor to further adjust survival in the status quo to fit to Global Cancer Observatory (GLOBOCAN) 2018 estimates for cervical cancer mortality by 5-year age group (appendix pp 3&#8211;7, 63&#8211;70). Detailed country-specific estimates for status quo treatment access rates are provided in the appendix (pp 63&#8211;70). Staging is according to International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging for carcinoma of cervix (2009 version) and TNM, 7th edition. Data based on a systematic review done by WHO, which obtained information from 43 countries, prioritising countries with population-based cancer registries. Results were derived by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) subregions. Regional results shown are weighted on the basis of each country's cancer case burden.*Treatment access rates were estimated on the basis of radiotherapy access and on the most recent availability of external beam radiation therapy and personnel (radiation oncologists, medical physicists, and radiation therapy technologists), which were provided by the Directory of Radiotherapy Centres (DIRAC). Ranges of treatment access rates in each region encompass the lowest and the highest treatment access rates of the countries in each region and represent the percentage of the population that could potentially be serviced on the basis of the equipment and workforce available.\nCalibration to GLOBOCAN 2018\nGlobal Cancer Observatory (GLOBOCAN) 2018 estimates are based on IARC-certified cancer registry information where available in a country, or on a series of estimation methods if verified registry data are not available.1, 2 Each group incorporated initial country-level stage-specific 5-year and 10-year survival rates, and models were then calibrated to country-specific and age-specific mortality rates from GLOBOCAN 2018 by incorporating a quality factor into the final estimated country-specific and stage-specific survival assumptions. This approach encompasses limitations in the available data on staging, treatment access, uncertainties in actual delivery of treatment, variations in treatment delivery from established protocols and recommendations, equipment and infrastructure maintenance and logistics, and treatment abandonment. The calibrated results for incidence and mortality are shown for each model in the appendix (pp 3&#8211;7), summarised as the results across all 78 LMICs and at the regional level. Calibration results were comparable for all three models and generally demonstrated good fit with GLOBOCAN 2018.\nModelled scenarios\nModels projected age-standardised cervical cancer mortality and deaths over time in 78 LMICs for standardised scenarios. The selection of core scenarios was determined after consultation at several WHO technical expert, advisory group, and global stakeholder meetings in 2018 and was based on a multi-step process, as previously described.15, 23 The scenarios were aligned with the scale-up targets articulated in the WHO draft global strategy for elimination.14 The final fully articulated core scenarios for the mortality impact analysis were ongoing girls-only vaccination at age 9 years with multi-age cohort catch-up in the first year for ages 10&#8211;14 years (S1); girls-only vaccination, once-lifetime screening at around age 35 years with precancer treatment, and invasive cancer treatment scale-up (S2); and girls-only vaccination, twice-lifetime screening at around ages 35 years and 45 years with precancer treatment, and invasive cancer treatment scale-up (S3; the WHO triple-intervention strategy). We also considered two supplementary vaccination scenarios: girls-only vaccination with initial extended multi-age cohort catch-up to age 25 years (S4), and vaccination of girls and boys at age 9 years with multi-age cohort catch-up at ages 10&#8211;14 years (S5; appendix 57&#8211;59).Vaccination was assumed to scale up to 90% coverage from 2020 with 100% lifetime broad spectrum protection against HPV oncogenic types 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 in individuals susceptible to the relevant type; the analysis thus applies to a broad-spectrum vaccine that protects against these types either by direct protection (as per a second-generation 9-valent vaccine) or via cross-protection for non-vaccine-included types. We assumed that full efficacy against vaccine types was achieved with two doses for vaccine recipients aged younger than 15 years, and with three doses for older vaccine recipients (although dose delivery was not explicitly modelled). Cervical screening was assumed to involve HPV testing once or twice per lifetime at age 35 years, or at ages 35 years and 45 years, with increasing uptake from 45% in 2023, 70% in 2030, to 90% in 2045 onwards. Sensitivity of HPV testing was assumed to be 90% for CIN2 and 94% for CIN3 or worse, independent of age. We assumed that 90% of HPV screen-positive women received visual assessment and appropriate treatment as required for precancer or cancer (triaging was not explicitly modelled). For successfully delivered precancer treatment, treatment success was assumed to be 100%; CCEMC groups differed in their modelling of post-treatment natural history for whether an elevated risk of recurrence was simulated (appendix pp 50&#8211;56). We assumed that 50% of women with invasive cervical cancers would have access to high quality surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy by 2023, and this would increase to 90% by 2030. Once treatment access was scaled up to 90% in 2030, 10-year survival was assumed to increase to 78% for women diagnosed at FIGO Stage 1, 69% at FIGO Stage 2, 52% at FIGO Stages 3&#8211;4A, and 8% at FIGO Stage 4B (appendix p 71).For this analysis we considered two types of intervention packages&#8212;vaccination alone or vaccination combined with cervical screening and treatment for precancer and screen-detected cancer, delivered in conjunction with scaled-up treatment services for clinically detected cancer. This approach took into account the feasibility and acceptability of whether interventions could be considered in isolation from each other. Although vaccination can be considered in isolation since it is prophylactic, population-wide implementation of cervical screening leads to screening-related detection of precancer and invasive cervical cancer (with favourable effects on stage-shifting). Referral pathways should be organised so that women with screen-detected invasive cancer are offered prompt and effective treatment (with treatment capacity scaling up as screening expands), since this approach then leads to improved survival outcomes.\nComparative modelling approach and outcomes\nEach single-model analysis was done independently at a country level. The coordinating centre for the analysis (Cancer Council NSW, Australia) aggregated all results, applied standard populations and population projections, and estimated the median and range of results. Results are presented across all 78 LMICs, regionally, and by country. Rates were age-standardised by applying the age structure of the 2015 World Female Population aged 0&#8211;99 years. Premature mortality from cervical cancer was estimated by applying the 2015 World Female Population for ages 30&#8211;69 years, and in sensitivity analysis it was based on the probability of death from cervical cancer from age 30 years to 70 years.16 For calculation of deaths averted, country-specific and age-specific population projections were based on the UN World Population Prospects: 2017 Revision.25 Relative reductions over time were compared to the status quo. We summarised results for mortality reductions, and deaths averted were calculated from the beginning of 2020 to the end of 2030, 2070, and 2120, with the median (range) of model predictions for each result. See the appendix (pp 46&#8211;49) for more details.\nSensitivity analysis\nThe analysis was a comparative exercise based on three models with different structural and parameterisation assumptions and a form of sensitivity analysis is built into the reported ranges of results. We reported on key model-specific findings for calibration outcomes and for age-specific mortality rates (appendix pp 3&#8211;7, 11&#8211;25). We also ran explanatory (but counterfactual) scenarios to understand the sensitivity of the model results to underlying aspects of the impact modelling, including an extreme sensitivity analysis on the impact of cancer treatment scale-up. We also assessed the impact of using alternative population structures for age standardisation on the predicted age-standardised rate and the impact of different underlying fertility assumptions for population projections on the cumulative number of cervical cancer deaths averted.\nRole of the funding source\nThis research was partly funded by WHO, which contributed to study design, data analysis, data interpretation, and writing of the report. Other funders had no role in the design of this analysis or the decision to submit for publication. KC, JJK, and MB had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.\nResults\nPredictions from the three models were broadly consistent for all scenarios. Figure 1 shows the summary results across the models for the reduction in age-standardised mortality from 2020 to 2120, table 2 depicts these findings as numerical snapshots of the rates and relative reductions compared to the status quo scenario over time, and the reductions in premature mortality in women aged 30&#8211;69 years. Snapshots of the age-specific findings in 2020, 2070, and 2120 for each of the three CCEMC models are shown in the appendix (pp 11&#8211;25).Figure 1Age-standardised cervical cancer mortality over time for all 78 LMICsThe solid lines represent the median outcome of the three models; the shading represents the range of model outputs.

Results represent the median (range) of estimates across all three models. Detailed results for each decade are provided in the appendix (pp 8&#8211;10). S0=status quo (no scale-up of vaccination, screening, or treatment). S1=female-only vaccination. S2=female-only vaccination and once-lifetime HPV testing at age 35 years and treatment scale-up. S3=female-only vaccination and twice-lifetime HPV testing at age 35 years and 45 years and treatment scale-up. Supplementary S4=female-only vaccination with multi-age cohort catch-up to 25 years in 2020. Supplementary S5=vaccination of girls and boys at age 9 years. All vaccination strategies assume the use of a broad-spectrum HPV vaccine with protection against the seven oncogenic types: 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58. Population projections were obtained from the UN and further projected out to 2120 (appendix pp 46&#8211;49). Model methods incorporate randomness and heterogeneity in estimates, which can occasionally, over shorter term timeframes, lead to relative increases rather than decreases in rates compared to the status quo, shown here as negative values. Randomness and heterogeneity can also lead to slight decreases in the percentage reduction in predicted rates even in the first year modelled (2020) and small differences from the expected relative ordering of the impact of different scenarios or the expected relative reductions over time. Caution should be applied in interpreting comparative differences between the values in this table, which represent the median and range across models; any individual median result could represent the findings of any one of the WHO Cervical Cancer Elimination Modelling Consortium (CCEMC) models.*Note that relative reductions in premature mortality are very similar if using the probability of dying between the ages of 30 and 70 years as a measure (appendix pp 8&#8211;10).Figure 2A depicts annual cervical cancer deaths over time and figure 2B provides information about the cumulative cervical cancer deaths averted. Table 3 summarises these findings for the cumulative deaths and deaths averted over the periods 2020&#8211;2030, 2020&#8211;2070, and 2020&#8211;2120, for all core and supplementary scenarios.Figure 2Projected cervical cancer deaths across all 78 low-income and lower-middle-income countries(A) Annual cervical cancer deaths.

All vaccination strategies assume the use of a broad-spectrum HPV vaccine with protection against the seven oncogenic types: 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58. Population projections were obtained from the UN and further projected out to 2120 (appendix pp 48&#8211;49). The median for deaths is the median of three possible model outputs for a given time period, and might use results from different models at different periods; similarly, the median for deaths averted and percentage reduction versus S0 is the median model for these metrics independently, and might be different to the median model selected for total deaths metric, and might also be different across the different periods. Caution should be applied in interpreting comparative differences between the values in this table, which represent the median and range across models; any individual median result could represent the findings of any one of the Cervical Cancer Elimination Modelling Consortium models. Note that the sum of averted cases and cases predicted for a given strategy might also not be identical to cases predicted for S0 because of rounding.*Note that table entry is zero due to rounding. Actual median and range of estimates for deaths averted: 620 (&#8722;1100 to 3600) deaths (model methods incorporate randomness and heterogeneity in estimates, which can occasionally, over shorter-term timeframes, lead to relative increases rather than decreases in rates compared to the status quo, shown here as a negative value).In 2020, the predicted age-standardised rate for cervical cancer mortality across all 78 LMICs was 13&#183;2 (range 12&#183;9&#8211;14&#183;1) per 100&#8200;000 women. By 2030, vaccine-only strategies would have minimal impact on cervical cancer mortality, which would remain at 13&#183;2 (12&#183;9&#8211;14&#183;0) deaths per 100&#8200;000 women, corresponding to a 0&#183;1% (0&#183;1&#8211;0&#183;5) reduction, averting a median of 620 deaths across all 78 LMICs by 2030 (rounded to 0&#183;0 million in table 3). However, scaling up twice-lifetime cancer screening and treatment in addition to vaccination would result in a mortality rate of 8&#183;5 (8&#183;2&#8211;10&#183;8) by 2030, corresponding to a 34&#183;2% (23&#183;3&#8211;37&#183;8) reduction, averting 300&#8200;000 (300&#8200;000&#8211;400&#8200;000) deaths, mainly due to the impact of improved access to cancer treatment. In this 10-year timeframe, vaccination plus once-lifetime screening or twice-lifetime screening and treatment scale-up would lead to similar mortality reductions. For further information about the relative contribution of the interventions, see the appendix (pp 33&#8211;40).By 2070, girls-only vaccination would lead to a mortality rate of 5&#183;0 (range 4&#183;5&#8211;5&#183;4) per 100&#8200;000 women, corresponding to a reduction of 61&#183;7% (61&#183;4&#8211;66&#183;1), averting 4&#183;8 million (4&#183;1&#8211;4&#183;8) deaths, but scaling up once-lifetime screening and treatment in addition to vaccination would result in a rate of 1&#183;4 (1&#183;4&#8211;2&#183;2) per 100&#8200;000 women, corresponding to a reduction of 88&#183;9% (84&#183;0&#8211;89&#183;3), averting 13&#183;3 million (13&#183;1&#8211;13&#183;6) deaths. By 2070, girls-only vaccination, twice-lifetime screening, and treatment would result in a mortality rate of 1&#183;0 (0&#183;9&#8211;1&#183;6) per 100&#8200;000 women, corresponding to a reduction of 92&#183;3% (88&#183;4&#8211;93&#183;0), averting 14&#183;6 million (14&#183;1&#8211;14&#183;6) deaths. Compared to girls-only vaccination with catch-up to age 14 years (S1), extended-multi-age cohort vaccination to 25 years (S4) would result in increased intermediate-term mortality benefits, bringing forward the benefits of vaccination by about a decade (figure 1). At the high levels of vaccination coverage for girls assumed in the analysis, additional vaccination of boys at age 9 years (S5) would have minimal additional impact on cervical cancer mortality in women over the next 50 years and would have similar intermediate-term benefits to girls-only vaccination by 2070 (figure 1, figure 3, table 2).Figure 3Age-standardised cervical cancer mortality over time for LMICs in each regionThe solid lines represent the median outcome of the three models; the shading represents the range of model outputs. HPV=human papillomavirus. LMICs=low-income and lower-middle-income countries. S0=status quo (no scale-up of vaccination, screening or treatment). S1=female-only vaccination at 9 years with multi-age cohort catch-up to age 14 years in 2020. S2=female-only vaccination and once-lifetime HPV testing at age 35 years with cancer treatment scale-up. S3=female-only vaccination and twice-lifetime HPV testing at age 35 years and 45 years with cancer treatment scale-up. Supplementary S4=female-only vaccination at 9 years with extended multi-age cohort catch-up to age 25 years in 2020. Supplementary S5=female and male vaccination at age 9 years with multi-age cohort catch-up to age 14 years in 2020. All scenarios assume the use of a broad-spectrum HPV vaccine with protection against seven oncogenic types.By 2120, girls-only vaccination would result in a mortality rate of 1&#183;3 (range 1&#183;3&#8211;1&#183;9) per 100&#8200;000 women, corresponding to a mortality reduction of 89&#183;5% (86&#183;6&#8211;89&#183;9), averting 45&#183;8 million (44&#183;7&#8211;46&#183;4) deaths. By 2120, a mortality rate of 0&#183;2 (0&#183;2&#8211;0&#183;5) per 100&#8200;000 women, corresponding to a reduction of 98&#183;6% (96&#183;5&#8211;98&#183;6), would be achievable with the WHO triple-intervention strategy, averting 62&#183;6 million (62&#183;1&#8211;62&#183;8) deaths. If screening were done once per lifetime instead of twice, 60&#183;8 million (60&#183;2&#8211;61&#183;2) deaths would be averted over the same period. The specific estimate for the incremental benefit of the twice-lifetime versus once-lifetime screening package over this period was 1&#183;6 million (1&#183;3&#8211;2&#183;5) additional deaths averted, with most of these additional deaths averted before 2070. Compared to girls-only vaccination alone, 16&#183;8 million (16&#183;4&#8211;17&#183;4) additional deaths would be averted via the triple-intervention strategy by 2120.In terms of premature mortality outcomes (deaths at age 30&#8211;69 years), the triple-intervention strategy would result in rate reductions of 33&#183;9% (range 24&#183;4&#8211;37&#183;9) by 2030, 96&#183;2% (94&#183;3&#8211;96&#183;8) by 2070, and 98&#183;6% (96&#183;9&#8211;98&#183;8) by 2120 (table 2).Figure 3 shows the regional results across the models for the reduction in age-standardised mortality from 2020 to 2120. The highest mortality rates in 2020, at approximately 30 per 100&#8200;000 women, are in sub-Saharan Africa, followed by Latin America and the Caribbean (approximately 16 per 100&#8200;000 women). These regions are predicted to have the greatest absolute reductions in mortality rates over the next two decades if the triple-intervention strategy can be successfully scaled up; by 2040, cervical cancer mortality in sub-Saharan Africa could be reduced by more than two-thirds to less than ten per 100&#8200;000 women, and in Latin America and the Caribbean it could be reduced to approximately six per 100&#8200;000 women. Details about the age-specific cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates in 2020, 2070, and 2120 for each region are provided in the appendix (pp 11&#8211;25).With the WHO triple-intervention strategy, over the next 10 years, about half (48% [range 45&#8211;55]) of deaths averted would be in sub-Saharan Africa and almost a third (32% [29&#8211;34]) would be in South Asia (including India); over the next century, almost 90% of deaths averted would be in these regions (appendix p 26).The appendix (pp 27&#8211;32) provides information at the country level for the predicted impact of the WHO triple-intervention strategy. In all countries, the median estimates of mortality rates by 2120 approach 1 per 100&#8200;000 women or lower.The findings for model-specific, explanatory, and sensitivity analyses are provided in the appendix (pp 11&#8211;25, 33&#8211;43). Overall, the findings were concordant between models. The only notable difference was in the level of herd immunity predicted at older ages for unvaccinated individuals, which probably relate to underlying differences in assumptions around assortative sexual mixing among different age groups and different behaviour groups; we consider that the model variation in this area provides a useful reflection of true uncertainty in outcomes. The explanatory results demonstrated that the main benefits by 2030 were via cancer treatment scale-up, and that screening would lead to substantial mortality reductions beyond those conferred by vaccination and cancer treatment scale-up from 2030 to 2070&#8211;80. The results of the sensitivity analysis show that the choice of standard population is an important driver for rate estimates and also showed that, for deaths averted, differences between individual model estimates were much smaller than the unavoidable uncertainties in future population projections over the next century.\nDiscussion\nIn this analysis, we have quantified, for the first time, the number of women's lives that could be saved by the successful implementation of the WHO global strategy for cervical cancer elimination. This report complements our parallel analysis on cervical cancer incidence.15 Importantly, by extending the analysis to encompass mortality outcomes, we have quantified the impact of scaling up cancer treatment. Taken together, these two modelling analyses show that successful implementation of the WHO 90&#8211;70&#8211;90 triple-intervention strategy by 2030 would reduce cervical cancer incidence to 0&#183;7 (0&#183;6&#8211;1&#183;6) per 100&#8200;000 women15 and mortality to 0&#183;2 (0&#183;2&#8211;0&#183;5) per 100&#8200;000 women across all 78 LMICs by 2120. This outcome, which is only achievable through a multi-sectoral and integrated approach across the continuum of cancer care, would represent extraordinary reductions in cervical cancer incidence (97% reduction) and mortality (99% reduction). Consequently, around 74&#183;1 million cervical cancer cases and 62&#183;6 million deaths would be averted, representing an enormous gain in terms of both quality of life and lives saved.A major strength of this study is that we used a comparative approach involving well established model platforms that have been previously validated with data from multiple countries and that have jointly informed many national vaccination and cervical screening policy decisions. Predictions from the three models were broadly consistent for all scenarios, even over a century-long projection period. Our results for vaccination-only strategies are generally consistent with a recent analysis of the shorter-term impact on likely radiotherapy demand in LMICs,26 which estimated that bivalent HPV vaccination of girls aged 12 years would only result in a 3&#183;9% reduction in incident cervical cancer cases from 2015 to 2035. In line with our findings, the analysis found that incremental scale-up of radiotherapy in LMICs in the shorter term (up to 2035) would yield substantial health gains. Our sensitivity analysis demonstrated that for deaths averted, the variations generated by the differences in models were much smaller than uncertainties due to population size and structure over the next century. The sensitivity analysis also demonstrated that rates are somewhat sensitive to the choice of standard population used; this emphasises the importance of using the 2015 World Female Population for calculating cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates for comparability with our findings and across countries.There were also some limitations to our analysis. The quality and availability of data about access to cancer treatment services, effective delivery of treatment, stage-distribution at diagnosis, and survival are variable for LMICs. Our modelling of survival was based on the latest data from major WHO reviews and we used updated DIRAC radiotherapy machine density as a surrogate for radiotherapy capacity and treatment access; this approach is reflective of the importance of radiotherapy as a cornerstone of effective treatment for cervical cancer and in line with the approach used by recently published models and the 2015 Lancet Oncology Commission on expanding global access to radiotherapy.26, 27 Furthermore, each modelling group independently did country-level model calibration of stage-specific survival to the best available mortality estimates from GLOBOCAN 2018. We incorporated a calibrated quality factor into the final estimated country-specific and stage-specific survival assumptions, which encompasses data limitations in treatment delivery information as well as variations in treatment delivery from established protocols and recommendations, equipment and infrastructure maintenance and logistics, and treatment abandonment due to financial stress or for other reasons. We did not take into account treatment improvements over time, assuming that mortality benefits resulting from cancer treatment scale-up by 2030 will be only due to the delivery of existing, effective treatment modalities, and not to emerging or hypothetical improvements in treatment beyond what is proven to be effective on a large scale in health services in high-income countries today.Another limitation is that we did not explicitly model HPV infection, precancer and cervical cancer in women living with HIV. Increased progression to precancer and invasive cancer and reduced clearance of HPV is known to occur in women living with HIV, and this group is at increased risk of developing invasive cervical cancer, although this risk might now be partly or largely countered by the beneficial effects of antiretroviral therapy in many settings.28, 29 A separate collaborative group sponsored and coordinated by WHO is analysing the effects of HIV burden on estimates of cervical cancer elimination timing in selected countries. Current WHO cervical screening recommendations specify more frequent screening in women living with HIV,30 and thus the mortality benefits we predicted are likely to depend on successful implementation of more intensive strategies for screening in high HIV-burden settings.We did not include vaccination of boys or adult women in our core scenarios, because neither strategy has been found to be universally cost-effective even in high-income countries, and neither approach is recommended as part of the draft WHO elimination strategy. WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunisation (SAGE) has recommended that vaccinating boys or older women should be delayed until current vaccine supply constraints are alleviated.31 Priority should be given to vaccination of young girls since this strategy will generate the greatest health benefits overall; boys will derive protection via herd immunity if high-coverage vaccination can be achieved in girls, and older women will be offered protection via scale-up of screening and treatment services. In this analysis, we did not explicitly consider cost-effectiveness, although previous work has shown the cost-effectiveness of combined vaccination and cervical screening approaches in various upper-middle-income countries and LMICs.32, 33 Cost-effectiveness will be required to weigh the trade-offs of the different strategies assessed here, including the incremental costs and benefits of vaccinating boys and doing two cervical screening tests instead of one in a lifetime. We found that the additional benefit of twice-lifetime versus once-lifetime screening was 1&#183;6 million more deaths averted over a century, but the differences in cases averted is much higher.15 Thus, the incremental improvement in quality of life from including a second screen is likely to be substantial. Furthermore, our findings for screening are in the context of rapid and effective scale-up of cancer treatment. If cancer treatment is not as broadly available as we assumed, the incremental benefits of additional cancer prevention via increasing screening to two tests in a lifetime would be larger. Finally, the incremental benefits of a second screen are higher when considered over the next 50 years rather than 100 years, because if vaccination is scaled up successfully then screening will provide the most benefit in the next 50&#8211;60 years. In the future, it will be important to assess the potential for future de-intensification of cervical screening, since our findings suggest that this could be considered in some countries after about 2070&#8211;80, when the full benefits of vaccination for mortality outcomes are becoming realised. The ongoing work of the CCEMC is focused on more detailed analysis of the incremental benefits of the strategies and on quantifying cost-effectiveness for the 78 LMICs; we are also analysing a larger number of more nuanced alternative scenarios at a country level, including optimal triage policy. In general terms, more detailed country-level analyses, taking into account specific local factors important for the effective delivery of vaccination and screening interventions, will continue to be required, and should be viewed as an important complement to the current large-scale analysis.The WHO scale-up targets for elimination can be considered aspirational. Many challenges will need to be overcome, including vaccine and screening test supply and delivery challenges, and the infrastructure challenges associated with scale-up of invasive cancer diagnostics, treatment, and supportive and palliative care services. If scale-up is achieved more slowly than we have assumed, then reductions in mortality will be correspondingly delayed. With respect to HPV vaccination, the assumed scaled up 90% coverage rate is broadly in line with data suggesting that global coverage of other vaccines in LMICs (including measles, poliomyelitis, hepatitis B and diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis) is 84&#8211;90%.34 Our analysis for screening broadly applies to a wide range of clinically validated HPV tests that can achieve benchmark sensitivity and specificity. Testing could be done either at a central laboratory or in a point of care environment, with clinician-collected or self-collected samples; the sensitivity of PCR-based self-collected tests has been shown to be comparable to that of clinician-collected samples.35 In principle, our findings also apply to any future screening test with similar performance to that of primary HPV testing. For example, machine learning approaches for analysing digitised cervical images hold promise in some settings.36 Our modelling of screening assumed that the majority (90%) of HPV-positive women were treated, with visual assessment for treatment done only to exclude the possibility of a frank cancer or a large precancerous lesion (which would require referral). Therefore, our findings for the impact of the cervical screening and referral pathway are likely to represent the maximum attainable benefit. In practice, resource-stratified guidelines recommend different approaches in different settings and, where possible, women are triaged to treatment to minimise the potential harms, which include psychosocial impact, potential overtreatment, and a possible impact on obstetric outcomes. WHO is revising its guidelines for cervical screening and has already revised its guidelines for precancer treatment to take into account the latest evidence and the elimination strategy.30, 37One of our main findings is that although achieving cervical cancer elimination per se will take many decades, the benefits of scaling up to the WHO elimination coverage targets will start to be realised within a decade. Key to this insight is an understanding of the timing of the effects of each intervention. Over the next 10&#8211;20 years, scaling up cancer treatment services will have the greatest impact because thousands of women in LMICs are being diagnosed every year with cervical cancer but have no access to adequate treatment. With appropriate treatment, survival prospects for early-stage and locally advanced cervical cancer are high. As a linked issue, offering appropriate palliative care to women who require it is an ethical and moral imperative. Over the intermediate term (the next 50&#8211;60 years), cervical screening will make an important contribution to outcomes, and over the longer term the full benefits of vaccination will be realised. The realisation of the major benefits of screening and vaccination over the intermediate and longer term will, however, require immediate action to implement these initiatives.Scaling up to national vaccination, screening, and cancer treatment services in LMICs will be greatly facilitated by the successful realisation of universal health coverage in countries (SDG target 3.8). The 2019 Political Declaration of the UN high-level meeting on universal health coverage reaffirmed that health is a precondition for, and an outcome and indicator of, all dimensions of sustainable development, and countries strongly recommitted to achieving universal health coverage by 2030.38 Building resilient and sustainable health systems could also be facilitated by the cervical cancer elimination initiative.39 For example, cervical screening initiatives might be able to support or build on HIV services, since women receiving antiretroviral therapy return for refills regularly. Opportunities exist to link screening with sexual and reproductive health services, potentially increasing both uptake of screening and of contraception services. The elimination initiative could assist with building cancer literacy and addressing stigma in communities, and scaling up treatment as well as supportive and palliative care services for cervical cancer should have positive implications for various other tumour types. Access to universal health coverage will be a key underlying factor for the achievement of SDG goal 3.4, to reduce premature mortality from non-communicable diseases by a third by 2030. We have shown that, when considered at a level across all 78 LMICs, the cervical cancer elimination initiative will specifically support efforts to achieve this target. More broadly, the elimination agenda will support a reduction in poverty (SGD1), an increase in gender equality (SDG5), and reduction in inequalities (SDG10). Thus, successful implementation of the elimination initiative will have both nearer-term and enduring positive consequences, not only for women but also for their families and broader society.In conclusion, these findings emphasise the importance of acting now on three fronts to scale up HPV vaccination, screening, and treatment for cervical cancer. In the next 10 years, achieving substantial reductions in cervical cancer mortality will depend on successful scale-up of cancer treatment services in LMICs, and supportive and palliative care will need to be scaled up alongside such services. Implementing the WHO strategy towards cervical cancer elimination will result in large-scale mortality reductions and more than 62 million women's lives saved over the next century in LMICs.

Directly observed highly-active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) enhances virological suppression, and could prevent transmission. Our objective was to project the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of directly observed administration of antiretroviral drugs in pregnancy.Methods and Findings\nA mathematical model was created to simulate cohorts of one million asymptomatic HIV-infected pregnant women on HAART, with women randomly assigned self-administered or directly observed antiretroviral therapy (DOT), or no HAART, in a series of Monte Carlo simulations. Our primary outcome was the quality-adjusted life expectancy in years (QALY) of infants born to HIV-infected women, with the rates of Caesarean section and HIV-transmission after DOT use as intermediate outcomes. Both self-administered HAART and DOT were associated with decreased costs and increased life-expectancy relative to no HAART. The use of DOT was associated with a relative risk of HIV transmission of 0.39 relative to conventional HAART; was highly cost-effective in the cohort as a whole (cost-utility ratio $14,233 per QALY); and was cost-saving in women whose viral loads on self-administered HAART would have exceeded 1000 copies/ml. Results were stable in wide-ranging sensitivity analyses, with directly observed therapy cost-saving or highly cost-effective in almost all cases.Conclusions\nBased on the best available data, programs that optimize adherence to HAART through direct observation in pregnancy have the potential to diminish mother-to-child HIV transmission in a highly cost-effective manner. Targeted use of DOT in pregnant women with high viral loads, who could otherwise receive self-administered HAART would be a cost-saving intervention. These projections should be tested with randomized clinical trials.", "body": "Introduction\nMother-to-child transmission is the most common cause of pediatric human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in North America. United States surveillance data identified 139 newly recognized HIV infections in children of mothers with HIV infection in the U.S. in 2007; over 9,500 children with likely vertical acquisition of HIV infection have developed AIDS since the HIV epidemic began [1]. Maternal viral load in the third trimester of pregnancy is a strong predictor of risk of HIV transmission to the newborn, and its reduction through the use of highly-active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) appears to markedly reduce the risk of peripartum HIV transmission [2], [3], [4], [5].Recognition of the large potential impact of maternal HIV replication on transmission has resulted in revision of U.S. and European guidelines on antiretroviral use in pregnancy [6], [7], [8], [9]. These guidelines have long advocated the use of HAART in pregnancy for prevention of transmission, and HAART is now the standard of care for all pregnant HIV-infected women [6]. Adherence to a HAART regimen predicts suppression of viral replication and reduces the potential for emergence of resistant viral strains [10], [11], [12], [13]. Drug adherence is suboptimal in up to one-third of HIV-infected women of childbearing age [14], [15], [16], [17], notwithstanding increases in HAART compliance during pregnancy; mother-to-child transmission still occurs in 1&#8211;3% of infants born to HIV-infected women receiving antiretroviral treatment [17]. As low adherence to anti-retroviral therapies is significantly associated with mortality and increased risk of mother-to-child transmission [16], [17], it is important to establish other means of improving adherence in this high-risk group in order to improve clinical outcomes in both mothers and their infants.Directly observed therapy (DOT) is used in the treatment of tuberculosis to enhance the likelihood of treatment success and minimize the emergence of drug-resistant microbes, and has been proposed as a means of improving adherence to HAART [18], [19]. With HIV, unlike tuberculosis, disease duration is life-long, and medications must be given daily, making the routine use of directly observed HAART problematic. Recent randomized trials have demonstrated significant reductions in viral load in individuals receiving DOT for HIV infection, although this response may not be durable after discontinuation of DOT [20], [21], [22]. Nonetheless, in prisons and community-based settings, the use of DOT for HIV infection has been associated with a reduction in viral burden of 1 to 2 log, even in antiretroviral-experienced individuals [19], [20], [23], [24], [25], [26].The third trimester of pregnancy may present a unique opportunity for use of directly observed HAART in that the time horizon is limited. In addition to virologic suppression for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV, directly observed HAART could preserve the future potency of antiretroviral drug classes by limiting emergence of resistance in pregnant women taking these medications solely to prevent transmission. Furthermore, DOT could potentially be an economically attractive intervention, since, if successful, downstream medical costs associated with pediatric HIV infection will be prevented.The small number of perinatally infected infants makes it challenging to study the impact of DOT-HAART for prevention of perinatal HIV transmission in the context of a prospective, randomized trial; in the absence of such a trial, simulations that aggregate the best available data may be a useful tool to optimize policy under uncertainty. Our objective was to use a simulation model to project the costs and clinical benefits that would be expected to result from the use of DOT in women receiving HAART in the third trimester of pregnancy.\nMethods\n\nThe Model\nWe constructed a probabilistic model of HIV infection in pregnancy to project the impact of directly observed HAART on vertical HIV transmission by HIV-infected women receiving treatment by the 3rd trimester of pregnancy (before 28 weeks gestation) according to current U.S. Department of Health and Human Services guidelines [6] (\nFigure 1\n), with some proportion of these women having started HAART prior to pregnancy for their own health, and some proportion starting within the first two trimesters of pregnancy with the goal of preventing mother-to-child HIV transmission. Clinical and cost outcomes were projected for a hypothetical cohort of women with asymptomatic HIV infection and CD4-positive lymphocyte counts >200 copies/ml.Women receiving HAART enter the model in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy. We assumed that all transmission occurs in the third trimester of pregnancy or in the peripartum period, and that the probability of transmission is conditional on the maternal viral load at the time of parturition. We incorporated the risk of preterm birth and the subsequent elevated risk of neonatal death, and the relative risks associated with emergency and elective Caesarean section and vaginal delivery. We assumed all infants would be formula-fed, making acquisition of HIV through breast feeding unlikely [27], [28].\nStrategies\nWe used our model to project downstream costs and consequences associated with self-administered HAART and directly observed HAART. For both strategies we assumed patients would receive otherwise standard obstetrical management. HAART was assumed to consist of a combination of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (excluding the combination of didanosine and stavudine) and one or two viral protease inhibitors, with the regimen dosed one or two times daily [6]. We assumed that non-nucleoside reverse transcription inhibitors would not be routinely used for longitudinal therapy in the third trimester [6]. Although current guidelines recommend that all women receive combination antiretroviral therapy in pregnancy, for their own health and/or to prevent vertical transmission [6], we added a hypothetical &#8220;no HAART&#8221; arm by removing the virological benefits and potential toxicity of HAART, in order to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of both antiretroviral strategies relative to no treatment.DOT was assumed to consist of daily home visits by a trained public health worker, with observation of the first dose of antiretroviral drugs. If a second daily dose was required, it would be self-administered, as described elsewhere [19]. Standard obstetrical management was considered to consist of monthly visits in the third trimester. Elective Caesarean section delivery was assumed to occur before the rupture of membranes and onset of labour, and was associated with a reduced risk of HIV transmission. Emergency Caesarean delivery was operative delivery after the rupture of membranes and/or onset of labor, and was not associated with a reduced risk of transmission. We assumed that elective Caesarean section was performed in women with viral loads >1,000 copies/ml at term not requiring emergency Caesarean section [6]. Where viral load was <1,000 copies/ml at term and emergency Caesarean section was not required, women could receive either elective Caesarean section or a vaginal delivery. We explored the costs and benefits associated with targeted use of DOT among certain subgroups of women.\nParameterization and Calibration\nProbabilities and ranges used in the model were derived from published medical literature obtained through keyword searches on MEDLINE, and through consultation with expert clinicians involved in treatment of pregnant women with HIV infection (\nTable 1\n). Individual women's baseline viral load &#8220;set points&#8221; (i.e., the approximate viral load that would be expected in that individual in the absence of antiretroviral therapy [29]) were drawn at random from a log-normal distribution. The baseline viral load distribution was constructed using viral loads observed in a cohort of 180 antiretroviral-na&#239;ve men [30], and reduced by 0.25 log to account for the possibility that viral set point is lower in women [31]. The impact of self-administered HAART was simulated by reducing the baseline viral load using data on the effectiveness of HAART from the Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) [32]. In women assigned to DOT, viral load was reduced again by a log quantity drawn randomly from a triangular distribution, to simulate the increase in adherence reported in association with directly observed HAART [19], [23], [24], [25]. In the base case, we assumed that toxicity secondary to HAART in the developing infant would not be enhanced by directly observed HAART.To ensure model validity, we calibrated parameters to so that outcomes would approximate those observed in a 2005 European Collaborative Study that showed the effectiveness of HAART in preventing mother-to-child HIV transmission in a cohort study of over 4000 mother-child pairs [33]. We calibrated values for the proportion of women with a viral load <200 copies/ml and the probability of vertical transmission at all viral loads, and we empirically inflated the rates of Caesarean sections (both emergency and elective) and premature births to more closely match the European study's proportions.Our primary outcome of interest was the quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALY) of infants born to women with HIV infection. Quality-adjusted survival estimates in HIV-infected children incorporated patient-derived, preference-based utility measures [34], in combination with survival estimates reported for pediatric populations and (because most infants will survive to adulthood) adult populations since the advent of HAART [34], [35], [36], [37]. Intermediate outcomes of interest included the number of Caesarean sections performed, and the number of HIV infections in infants under each strategy.We estimated costs from a societal perspective, including future healthcare costs associated with new HIV infections in infants [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43], [44]. The cost of delivery and direct observation of antiretroviral therapy was assumed to be equivalent to that described for tuberculosis-related directly observed therapy [45], [46]. All costs were converted to 2008 U.S. dollars using the Consumer Price Index for Medical Care Services [47], and future costs were discounted using a 3% annual rate in the base case [48].A health care intervention is considered to be &#8220;cost-saving&#8221; when it costs less but provides incremental benefit relative to a competing intervention; &#8220;highly cost-effective&#8221; when it costs less than the GDP per capita; and &#8220;cost-effective&#8221; when it is between one and three times a country's GDP per capita [49]. A cost-saving intervention is always preferred to competing programs or strategies [49], [50].\nSimulations\nWe generated estimates of costs and consequences of competing strategies through a series of Monte Carlo simulations. Such simulations utilize a random-number generator to create unique, simulated individual patients, and move them through a series of chance events over time [51], [52]. A running tally of outcomes, costs, and events is recorded, with the creation of simulated cohorts that can be compared to one another. Unless otherwise stated, results presented here are each based on five thousand simulations of 200-person clinical trials, with 100 women randomized to directly observed HAART and 100 women randomized to self-administered HAART in each trial.\nSensitivity Analyses\nWe evaluated our model assumptions and data inputs by performing univariate and bivariate sensitivity analyses. A plausible range was established for each parameter using the highest and lowest values in the published literature or confidence intervals when available, and by adopting alternative assumptions to those used in the base case analysis. When only one data point was available for a given parameter, we established plausible ranges through the use of expert opinion.\nResults\n\nModel Calibration\nOur final model was well calibrated to outcomes observed in a large European cohort study of pregnant women with HIV infection; we chose to calibrate our model to this study because it was the largest available study conducted in a context where HAART was widely available [33]. Final model parameter sets applied to the self-administered HAART strategy reproduced risks of mother-to-child HIV transmission, reduction in viral load in mothers receiving standard HAART, and risk of both emergency and elective Caesarean section reported in this study (\nFigure 2\n). The &#8220;no HAART&#8221; strategy in the model reproduced rates of vertical transmission consistent with those seen in trials of zidovudine and Cesarean section for prevention of HIV transmission [53], [54].\nEffectiveness and Cost-Effectiveness of Directly Observed HAART\nThe outcomes of five thousand simulated randomized controlled trials of directly observed HAART, compared to self-administered HAART, are presented in \nFigure 3\n. While we did include a &#8220;no HAART&#8221; strategy in our model, this strategy resulted in increased net costs and reduced quality-adjusted life expectancy relative to the self-administered HAART and directly observed HAART strategies in the cohort as a whole, and thus would never be preferred.A reduction in the probability of mother-to-child HIV transmission was seen with directly observed HAART in most trials, with a projected average relative risk of HIV infection of 0.39 among infants born to women receiving DOT versus those receiving self-administered HAART, and a relative risk of 0.09 as compared to women receiving no HAART (\nTable 2\n). The reduction in viral load among women receiving directly observed HAART also decreased the requirement for elective Caesarean section among women giving birth at term. There was a resultant average increase in the projected quality-adjusted survival of 11 quality adjusted life-days among infants born to women receiving directly observed antiretrovirals.On average, direct observation of HAART in the third trimester was projected to be a highly cost-effective intervention, with gains in quality-adjusted survival described above accompanied by net societal costs of $14,233. When trials were stratified according to participants' baseline viral loads, directly observed HAART was projected to be a cost-saving intervention in cohorts with viral loads above 1000 copies/ml. We projected savings of $54,278 per QALY in individuals with viral loads between 1,000 and 10,000 copies/ml, and savings of $26,240 per QALY in individuals with viral loads >10,000 copies/ml (\nTable 3\n).\nSensitivity Analyses\nWe performed wide-ranging sensitivity analyses by varying parameter values and using alternate model assumptions (\nTable 4\n). The projected attractiveness of directly observed therapy was insensitive to plausible changes in most model variables, including the probabilities of vertical HIV transmission, prematurity, and emergency and elective Caesarean section; obstetrical costs; and future costs associated with HIV infection and prematurity. Projections were somewhat sensitive to the baseline effectiveness of HAART in pregnant women (i.e. drug effectiveness without directly observed therapy), and the effectiveness of directly observed therapy. Projections were highly sensitive to the enhancement of toxicity of HAART as a result of greater drug exposure with directly observed therapy.In our base case analysis, we assumed that the costs of direct observation of HAART would be due to personnel time required to deliver and observe administration of medications. However, creation of a novel program could be associated with other fixed and capital costs (office space and supplies, acquisition of vehicles, etc.). The results of two-way sensitivity analyses on the effectiveness and cost of directly observed HAART in pregnancy are presented in \nFigure 4\n. When we biased our analysis against directly observed therapy by increasing the cost of drug delivery four-fold, and by reducing the effectiveness of direct observation to a 0.5 log change in viral load, the cost-effectiveness ratio associated with this strategy was $313,000 per QALY, a ratio that exceeds a commonly cited threshold for cost-effectiveness [49]. However, this is an extremely unfavourable assumption [50], [55]. Most other combinations of DOT effectiveness and cost were cost-effective or cost-saving, relative to self-administered HAART.We postulated that concern for a developing infant might result in enhanced adherence to self-administered HAART by pregnant women with HIV infection. We simulated such an effect by increasing the likelihood that pregnant women taking HAART would have a full (i.e., 2 log10) decrease in viral load with self-administered HAART (\nFigure 5\n). As baseline antiretroviral effectiveness of self-administered HAART improved, directly observed administration became less economically attractive at all tested willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of DOT was cost-effective (under $50,000, a commonly cited cost-effectiveness threshold) as long as the proportion of women responding fully to self-administered HAART was under 0.6.\nDiscussion\nMother-to-child HIV transmission remains an important but potentially preventable consequence of HIV infection in reproductive-age women. Although improvements in obstetrical management of HIV-infected women have greatly reduced the incidence of perinatal HIV infection, women now comprise 25% of those with newly diagnosed HIV infection and over 146,000 female adults and adolescents currently live with HIV/AIDS in the United States, suggesting that the pool of infants at risk for perinatal HIV infection remains large [1].Based on the direct relationship between maternal viral load and risk of vertical transmission, and the potential impact of directly observed therapy on viral load, we hypothesized that the provision of directly observed antiretroviral therapy to pregnant women with HIV infection could result in substantial health and economic gains, including a diminished need for Caesarean sections, decreased mother-to-child transmission of HIV, and increased quality-adjusted life expectancy in infants born to HIV-infected women. By diverting the large downstream medical costs associated with pediatric HIV infection, the direct observation of HAART in the third trimester of pregnancy was projected to be a highly cost-effective health intervention from a societal perspective, notwithstanding the short-term costs associated with drug delivery and directly observed drug administration, and targeting DOT to women with viral loads >1000 copies/ml on self-administered HAART was projected to be cost-saving. It is notable that cost-saving health interventions (such as vaccination against diseases of childhood) are uncommon in healthcare; most currently utilized healthcare interventions increase total costs, but are considered cost-effective if they provide a corresponding increase in health [50], [55]. As the Commission on Macroeconomics and Health of the World Health Organization has suggested that interventions can be considered cost-effective if they provide life years at a cost of <3 times per capita gross national income (formerly gross domestic product), our analysis suggests that DOT-CART would be cost-effective not only in high-income countries, but in a large number of middle-income countries as well [49], [56].While our analysis would strongly support the use of directly observed HAART in women in the third trimester of pregnancy, we may have underestimated the potential health benefits of this intervention. Direct observation of HAART could enhance the health of infants who acquire HIV infection by reducing the probability of primary infection with resistant virus [57], and could also improve future health in the mother by preserving the potency of antiretroviral classes for future use [6]. DOT might be given to those women with particularly unsettled social situations who would be most unlikely to benefit from self-administered HAART, such as those who are homeless, have substance abuse issues, or mental illness. Furthermore, the establishment of structured contact between pregnant, HIV-infected women and public health personnel, as would occur in the context of directly observed antiretroviral therapy, has been associated with improved pregnancy outcomes [58]. Such contacts could link infected women to improved healthcare after delivery as well as introduce them to more healthful behaviours while pregnant and perhaps more open to behaviour change.It is notable that the favourable health and economic projections associated with directly observed HAART in pregnancy remained robust even in the face of extreme variation in cost and effectiveness of directly observed therapy. We were able to identify only one scenario in which direct observation of HAART in pregnancy would not be preferred to self-administered HAART: a situation in which over 60% of pregnant women responded maximally to self-administered HAART, one that is inconsistent with empiric data on the high-risk women who are the focus of this analysis [14].Like any mathematical model, the model we present here is a simplified representation of complicated systems, and is thus subject to limitations. In particular, a relatively simple model is limited in its ability to capture the all the complexities related to the clinical management of HIV in pregnancy; thus, models such as this one are not a substitute for randomized clinical trials. However, by synthesizing the best available data on antiretroviral use in pregnancy and the potential benefits of directly observed antiretroviral therapy, modeling can help to inform clinical practice while such trials are pending. Also, by demonstrating the large potential benefits of a novel approach to therapy, such modeling may help to mobilize interest in, and support for, such trials. Our model is particularly important given that this topic is so difficult to study prospectively, due to the small number of HIV-infected infants born in the U.S. Multi-centre clinical trials are an important tool for better defining maximally effective and cost-effective interventions for prevention of vertical HIV transmission, especially with mothers at risk of medication non-adherence.In summary, based on best available data, we projected that pregnancy provides a unique indication for the use of directly observed antiretroviral therapy for HIV infection. In this context, a modest investment of resources would result in substantial health benefit with a net reduction in societal costs as a result of decreased mother-to-child HIV transmission. Randomized controlled trials of directly observed therapy can be advocated as a reasonable next step in optimizing the prepartum care of HIV-infected women.", "pmid": "20405011", "title": "The Cost-Effectiveness of Directly Observed Highly-Active Antiretroviral Therapy in the Third Trimester in HIV-Infected Pregnant Women", "journal_title": "PLoS ONE", "authors": "Caitlin J.

Measuring persistent HIV-1 is challenging, as it consists of a mosaic population of defective and intact proviruses that can shift from a state of latency to active HIV-1 transcription. Due to this complexity, most of the current assays detect multiple categories of persistent HIV-1, leading to an overestimate of the true size of the latent reservoir. Here, we review the development of the viral outgrowth assay, the gold-standard quantification of replication-competent proviruses, and discuss the insights provided by full-length HIV-1 genome sequencing methods, which allowed us to unravel the composition of the proviral landscape. In this review, we provide a dissection of what defines HIV-1 persistence and we examine the unmet needs to measure the efficacy of interventions aimed at eliminating the HIV-1 reservoir.", "body": "Defining the latent reservoir for HIV-1\nDespite effective antiretroviral therapy (ART), HIV-1 persists in all infected individuals as proviral DNA integrated within long-lived memory CD4+ T cells [1, 2]. Early studies of infected donors on suppressive ART demonstrated that a subset of these quiescent proviruses could be induced to replicate in tissue culture, comprising what we now consider the latent reservoir [3&#8211;8]. However, subsequent investigation has revealed that a complex population of both replication-competent and defective proviruses exists within every infected individual [9&#8211;17]. This population of persistent proviruses not only archives the cumulative viral genotypic diversity, which arose over the course of untreated infection, but also serves as the primary barrier to curing HIV-1 infection. Recent studies are changing our understanding of what defines the HIV-1 latent reservoir, how we quantify it, and how we leverage these quantitative data to predict the dynamics of viral rebound (or lack thereof) in infected individuals who interrupt suppressive ART.Given the complexity of HIV-1 persistence, it is critical that we employ accurate and precise definitions in our discussion. Persistent HIV-1 is an all-encompassing term that includes all forms of integrated proviral DNA that persist in infected individuals on the time-scale of years despite fully suppressive ART (Fig.&#160;1). This term does not define the ability to replicate; several cross-sectional studies have revealed that a diverse landscape of intact and defective persistent proviral DNA can be found in infected individuals [10, 12, 13, 15, 16]. Furthermore, persistent proviruses can exist in three distinct states of viral gene expression. First, a subset of persistent proviruses are undergoing active gene expression, producing LTR-driven RNA transcripts. The fraction of persistent proviruses undergoing active transcription at any given time, the nature of said transcripts, and the clinical implications of their expression are under active investigation [18&#8211;26]. Second, a subset of proviruses may exist in a functionally dead state, in which LTR-driven initiation of transcription is not possible, due to major genomic defects or irreversible epigenetic silencing. Finally, persistent proviruses can exist in a latent state. Latency is best defined as a reversible state of non-productive infection. Latent proviruses are those that could theoretically be induced to express LTR-driven transcripts, but at a given time do not initiate or maintain gene expression due to transcriptional or epigenetic constraints (e.g. lack of key transcription factors and co-regulators or suppressive chromatin modifications). The degree to which post-transcriptional blocks to HIV-1 gene expression enforce a state of latency in vivo is not yet completely understood, but is under active investigation.Fig.&#160;1Classification of HIV-1 DNA present in HIV-1&#160;+&#160;individuals on suppressive ART. A decision tree describing the classification of HIV-1 DNA based on integration, genomic integrity/replication competence, transcription state, and ability to be induced by T cell activation. A complementary table is provided indicating which forms of persistent HIV-1 DNA are detected by common assays in the field. Hatched patterns indicate that the relevant assay detects only a subset of viruses in a given category\nWhile many forms of persistent proviral DNA may impact the health of infected individuals, only replication-competent proviruses capable of viral rebound after ART cessation are a barrier to curing HIV-1 infection [3, 6]. Collectively, we term the cells that harbor persistent, replication-competent HIV-1 as HIV-1 reservoir(s). While several cell populations have been proposed as HIV-1 reservoirs, the only population yet convincingly shown to be a long-term reservoir for HIV-1 are resting memory CD4+ T cells harboring latent but replication-competent HIV-1. We term these cells the latent reservoir. In Fig.&#160;1, we provide a decision tree describing the classification of HIV-1 DNA found in HIV-1&#160;+&#160;individuals on suppressive ART, along with a complementary table indicating which forms of persistent HIV-1 DNA are detected by common assays in the field.\nThe quantitative viral outgrowth assay (QVOA) defines the latent reservoir\nEarly studies defining the tropism of HIV-1 indicated that activated CD4+ T lymphoblasts were the preferred target of infection. Activated CD4+ T lymphoblasts are short-lived effector cells of the immune system, and landmark viral dynamics studies indicated that most productively infected cells displayed a short half-life [27&#8211;32]. These initial observations, however, did not reveal that non-replicating forms of infectious HIV-1 might persist indefinitely in infected individuals.Nonetheless, experimental observations early in the HIV/AIDS epidemic were consistent with some form of HIV-1 persistence. A number of studies indicated that the fraction of mononuclear cells which contained proviral DNA far exceeded those that were positive for HIV-1 RNA [33], suggesting that a subset of apparently infected cells were not transcribing HIV-1 RNA. The first direct experimental evidence for persistence of full-length, replication-competent proviral DNA came in 1995 [1]. In this study, we demonstrated not only that latent integrated proviral DNA could be readily detected in resting CD4+ T cells from viremic donors, but that these quiescent proviruses could be induced by activation to produce infectious virus [1]. Definitive identification of the latent reservoir came shortly thereafter. Studies by our group, the Richman group, and the Fauci group demonstrated that replication competent HIV-1 could be recovered from infected individuals on suppressive ART [3&#8211;5]. Follow-up longitudinal studies indicated that despite effective ART, the latent reservoir did not appreciably decay (population half-life of 44&#160;months) [6, 8, 34]. This remarkable stability cemented the latent reservoir as the primary barrier to curing HIV-1 infection.Critical to these early discoveries was the method developed to quantify the frequency of resting CD4+ T cells harboring latent HIV-1: the quantitative viral outgrowth assay (QVOA) [3]. In this assay, resting CD4+ T cells are purified from the blood of HIV+ donors on suppressive ART and then plated in a limiting dilution format. Because these resting cells do not produce virus without T cell activation [1], any virus production induced in this population reflects the presence of latent HIV-1. To reverse latency and induce virus production, limiting dilutions of these cells are stimulated with a T cell activator (e.g. the mitogen phytohemagglutinin with irradiated allogeneic PBMCs or co-stimulatory antibodies). Released virus is propagated by addition of cells susceptible to infection, allowing exponential expansion of virus produced from a single latently infected cell to the point where detection by viral antigen ELISA is possible. Given the labor and resource intensive nature of the original QVOA protocol, several modifications to the QVOA have been made aiming at improving assay throughput (discussed below). Regardless, the QVOA remains a gold-standard assay for quantifying the latent reservoir.\nModifications of the QVOA to increase throughput\nIn essence, successful performance of the QVOA requires complete and reproducible activation of input CD4+ T cells to reverse HIV-1 latency, facilitation of outgrowth of reactivated replication-competent proviruses, and detection of that outgrowth. Various modifications of each of these steps have been successfully implemented.In the original studies, the QVOA was performed on resting memory CD4+ T cells to demonstrate the existence of quiescent but replication-competent proviruses. These resting memory CD4+ T cells were defined by the absence of accepted cell-surface markers of T cell activation (CD69, CD25, HLA-DR). However, given that the latent reservoir in resting CD4+ T cells has now been established as a mechanism of HIV-1 persistence, the purification of resting memory CD4+ T cells is not required. In fact, in some instances the purification of resting memory CD4+ T cells for QVOA analysis may not be advisable (e.g. after administration of a therapeutic that alters the expression of an accepted cell-surface marker of T cell activation). The QVOA is now routinely performed on bulk CD4+ T cells from HIV-1+ donors. In this situation, some infected CD4+ T lymphoblasts may also be present. Most of these cells have a short half-life, but in patients on ART they are likely derived from in vivo activation of infected resting CD4+ T cells.The standard QVOA protocol [3, 35, 36] calls for activation of input CD4+ T cells via stimulation with the mitogen PHA and allogeneic, irradiated feeder PBMCs. These conditions were selected on the basis of previous reports that they induced activation of roughly 100% of resting T cells [37]. However, alternative activation conditions have been successfully employed in inducing outgrowth of replication-competent HIV-1, including the use of immobilized CD3 and CD28 costimulatory antibodies [4], CD3 and CD28 antibody coated beads [38], and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) with ionomycin [18]. A large-scale formal comparison of these activation approaches in the QVOA has not yet been completed. However, a recent study did compare the efficacy of these activation approaches in inducing viral outgrowth in the QVOA using samples from five HIV-1 infected donors on suppressive ART, and no significant difference in the induction of viral outgrowth was observed between CD3/CD28 costimulation, PMA and ionomycin, and PHA with allogeneic, irradiated feeders [39]. This aligns with a previous study which showed comparable induction of viral outgrowth by CD3/CD28 antibody coated beads and PHA with allogeneic, irradiated feeders [38].After successful reactivation of latent proviruses via T cell stimulation, released virus is propagated by the addition of cells susceptible to HIV-1 infection. This step is critical, as the exponential outgrowth of reactivated proviruses definitively establishes these proviruses as replication-competent. While PHA-stimulated, CD8-depleted PBMCs obtained from uninfected donors have traditionally been used to promote viral outgrowth, alternatives have been described. These include the use of bulk PBMCs from uninfected donors [39] and the use of cell lines that support HIV-1 replication (e.g. MOLT-4/CCR5 cells, Sup-T1 cells) [40, 41]. In principle, any cell type that robustly supports HIV-1 replication should be suitable for use in the QVOA [41]. However, cell lines offer many obvious advantages over freshly isolated cells from uninfected donors, namely consistency and significantly reduced resource burden.Replication-competent proviruses must then be detected to determine the frequency of latent HIV-1 infection. Traditionally, the QVOA is performed in a limiting dilution format and viral outgrowth is detected via p24 antigen ELISA, with the frequency of latent infection calculated based on which well dilutions are positive for outgrowth using limiting dilution [42]. Using this approach, the QVOA requires 14&#8211;21&#160;days, largely due to the relative insensitivity of the p24 ELISA. While time intensive, this approach does ensure that only replication-competent viruses are detected.To reduce the time required to complete the QVOA, alternative methods for detecting viral outgrowth have been described. RT-qPCR detection of HIV-1 RNA in culture supernatant at assay day 7 was shown to be comparable to p24 antigen ELISA at day 14 at identifying outgrowth-positive wells [41], significantly shortening the QVOA. An important caveat to the use of more sensitive detection methods is that some defective proviruses can produce viral RNA and viral protein [24], and therefore it is essential to demonstrate exponential increases over time in the measured viral parameter [41]. A deep sequencing based QVOA was developed in which viral outgrowth was detected and latently infected cell frequencies were estimated via paired-end short-read sequencing of supernatant from bulk cultures, potentially shortening the assay and eliminating the need for limiting dilution [43]. The number of reactivated viruses captured in this bulk culture assay is derived from the number of distinct viral sequences captured. As such, this approach is not capable of distinguishing identical clones of replication-competent virus [14, 17], which may grow out simultaneously in a given bulk culture well. Finally, two recent studies describe the use of the TZM-bl reporter cell line to detect proviruses capable of new integration events [44, 45].The QVOA enabled the identification of the latent reservoir in resting memory CD4+ T cells, but the assay has also been modified to enable the interrogation of latent HIV-1 in other cell types. A viral outgrowth assay for latent SIV in resting macaque CD4+ T cells has been previously reported [46, 47], and a recent study describes the adaptation of the QVOA for detection of latent SIV proviruses in myeloid cells [48]. While the mechanisms for inducing the reactivation of latent proviruses in various cell types which may harbor latent proviruses could vary, the general approach of the standard QVOA can be adapted for other cell types to enable the discovery of potential new reservoirs for latent HIV-1.While the QVOA provides definitive evidence of the persistence of latent HIV-1, recent studies demonstrate that the assay does not capture all replication-competent proviruses in the latent reservoir. Two recent studies by our group demonstrate that additional viral outgrowth can be induced with multiple rounds of T cell activation [10, 17]. In these studies, CD4+ T cells from HIV-1 infected donors on ART are subjected to multiple rounds of T cell activation and virus expansion. In most cases, restimulation of cells from wells negative for outgrowth in the initial round of T cell activation increased the total number of latent proviruses detected by the QVOA. These findings demonstrate that not all replication-competent proviruses are reactivated by a given round of T cell activation, and suggest that cells carrying replication-competent HIV-1 can be activated and proliferate without producing virus [10, 17, 49]. Interestingly, identical replication-competent proviruses were obtained from distinct culture wells after different numbers of cycles of T cell activation, suggesting that clonally expanded CD4+ T cells harboring replication-competent proviruses may not respond uniformly to a given round of T cell activation. These findings are consistent with other recent reports in vivo [50] and ex vivo [14]. The finding that cells infected with replication-competent virus can be activated and proliferate without producing virus supports the hypothesis that the latent reservoir is maintained in part by cellular proliferation [11, 17, 49&#8211;52]. This has important implications for our understanding of the dynamics of the latent reservoir. The fact that the size of the latent reservoir remains relatively stable over time implies equilibrium between the proliferation and clearance of cells comprising the latent reservoir.Multiple-stimulation QVOA studies have demonstrated that latently infected CD4+ T cells are present at a higher frequency than detected by the standard QVOA. The standard QVOA can thus be considered a definitive minimal estimate for the size of the latent reservoir, capturing only a fraction of the latent reservoir with a single round of stimulation and outgrowth. Multiple-stimulation QVOA captures an ever-increasing fraction of the latent reservoir with each successive round of T cell activation and outgrowth. It is conceivable that after a sufficient number of rounds of T cell activation and outgrowth, the multiple-stimulation QVOA would capture all latently infected cells, but this is not experimentally feasible. Critically, these findings indicate that the latent reservoir is not well defined by the proviruses that can be reactivated and captured in the standard or multiple-stimulation QVOA. Rather, the latent reservoir may be better defined as those proviruses that are genetically intact and thus capable of replication in vivo. Under this definition, the latent reservoir can be best interrogated using molecular approaches that distinguish genetically intact proviruses.\nSequencing-based measures of the latent reservoir\nIn infected individuals on ART, 300/106 resting CD4+ T cells contain HIV-1 proviruses, but only a fraction of these proviruses are replication-competent HIV-1 [9]. The frequencies measured in the QVOA are in the range of 0.1&#8211;10 infections units per million (IUPM) resting CD4+ T cells. This large difference fueled interest in better understanding the proviral landscape. Several methods have been developed to capture the sequence of individual proviruses to distinguish defective proviruses from those intact ones that are potentially capable of replication.The importance of such sequencing based approaches is underscored by the surprising results of two recent studies that used a novel and unbiased single genome amplification method to define the sequence landscape of persistent proviruses and examine the nature of defects present in replication incompetent proviruses [10, 13]. In this method, near full-length PCR is performed to amplify proviruses in patient samples [53]. To enable single proviral sequencing, the outer PCR reaction is performed at limiting dilution. This prevents PCR recombination, ambiguous base calls, or competition between short and long templates, and instead allows for the amplification of individual proviruses. Following the outer PCR, inner PCRs are performed to confirm the clonality of the template, followed by a series of overlapping inner PCRs to amplify the complete provirus. The PCR products are run on agarose gels and cut out for direct sequencing to minimize PCR-induced error. Importantly, the amplification conditions must allow efficient detection of individual, full-length proviruses.Using this initial single proviral-genome sequencing method, we examined the sequences of the proviruses present in QVOA wells that were negative for viral outgrowth [10]. The vast majority of these proviruses were defective, harboring either large internal deletions and/or APOBEC3G-mediated hypermutation. Unexpectedly, however, an appreciable number of non-induced proviruses were intact, and subsequent in vitro infection experiments using base-for-base synthetic reconstructions of these proviruses confirmed their replication competence. These data suggested that the traditional QVOA was not capturing all replication-competent proviruses, but rather only the fraction induced in a single round of T cell activation and outgrowth. This was confirmed by multiple-stimulation QVOA experiments described above [17].A follow-up study employing the same method interrogated the proviral genomes from HIV-1 infected individuals present in unstimulated resting CD4+ T cells taken directly from infected individuals on ART. In this study, the composition of the proviral landscape was compared between viremic individuals and individuals who initiated ART during either acute or chronic infection [13]. Even in subjects treated during the acute/early phase of infection, only a very small fraction (5%) of proviruses are intact. Many of the proviral genomes in these individuals are hypermutated and a smaller fraction have deletions. The same method was applied to proviral DNA from individuals who started treatment during the chronic phase of infection. In this case, most proviruses (98%) were also defective, but the most common defects were internal deletions (80%). Importantly, the median frequency of cells carrying intact proviruses is more than 60-fold higher than what is detected by the standard QVOA. These studies are redefining our understanding of what comprises the latent reservoir, favoring a definition that includes all cells harboring a genetically intact and replication-competent provirus.The relevance of defective HIV-1 proviruses to the development and assessment of cure strategies is currently being investigated. A recent study demonstrated that hypermutated proviruses and proviruses that have defects in the major splice donor site and/or the packaging signal can be transcribed and that the resulting RNAs can spliced and translated [24]. Additional in vitro analysis indicates that cells carrying these defective proviruses can be recognized and targeted by HIV-1 specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) [41]. These findings support the hypothesis that defective proviruses may produce HIV-1 antigens and perturb adaptive immunity in vivo, potentially contributing to the persistent immune activation observed in patients on ART. Follow-up studies will certainly discern the degree to which these defective proviruses might impact patient health or effect efforts to eliminate the latent reservoir.Full-length proviral sequencing provides many advantages compared to other methods that probe sub-genomic regions. As discussed above, the proviral landscape is extremely heterogeneous due to HIV-1 intra-host diversity, internal deletions, and deamination-induced hypermutation. As a consequence, all sub-genomic amplification strategies introduce bias, resulting in sequence data that may not be representative of the actual population of HIV-1 proviruses present in a given sample. In particular, sub-genomic PCR studies can vastly overestimate the frequency of latently infected cells by detecting proviruses with lethal defects outside of the region amplified. They also underestimate the total number of infected cells because they fail to amplify proviruses with deletions overlapping the region amplified. Some sub-genomic sequencing assays can overestimate the fraction of identical sequences resulting from clonal expansion, especially in samples with reduced HIV-1 diversity, such as culture supernatants from QVOA or cells from patients treated during the early stages of acute infection [54].On the other hand, full-length sequencing is time consuming and labor intensive, often requiring custom design of additional primers and multiple sequencing reactions. Two recent studies applied Illumina-based next generation sequencing (NGS) to full-length HIV-1 proviral sequencing [15, 16]. Briefly, end-point diluted proviral DNA is amplified with a nested PCR spanning around 9&#160;kb of the HIV-1 genome. PCR products of variable size are purified and, following library preparation, loaded into the Illumina MiSeq platform. The contigs of single proviruses are constructed by de-novo assembly mapping reads against a reference genome. The output proviral sequences are then sorted based on the presence of defects that would preclude replication. This new approach is cost-effective and it simplifies the sequencing of difficult regions compared to Sanger approaches while yielding enough sequencing data to study the composition of the proviral landscape in CD4+ T cell subsets of interest. The study from Lee and colleagues applied this new sequencing approach to polarized phenotypic subsets of cells sorted based on intracellular cytokine staining [16]. Interestingly, they observed a higher proportion of intact proviruses in Th1 CD4+ T cells, which predominate in ART-treated subjects. Recently, Hiener et al. used the FLIP assay (full-length sequencing of individual proviruses) to investigate the composition of proviral DNA in CD4+ T cells across the differentiation subsets (Na&#239;ve&#160;&#8594;&#160;Central Memory&#160;&#8594;&#160;Transitional Memory&#160;&#8594;&#160;Effector Memory) [15]. This assay identified expanded clones in all subjects (n&#160;=&#160;6), for both defective and intact proviruses, supporting the role of cell proliferation in HIV-1 persistence. In addition, the contribution in intact proviruses was uneven across subsets, with effector memory CD4+ T cells showing the highest levels of intact genomes, contributing to a median of 75% of all intact proviruses. Surprisingly, central memory CD4+ T cells had the lowest levels of intact proviruses. Follow-up studies may be needed to investigate whether sub-optimal sampling and margination of central memory CD4+ T cells in secondary lymphoid tissues could have affected these observations.The studies from Lee et al. and Hiener et al. pioneered the use of NGS to characterize HIV-1 persistence and contributed to our understanding of the complexity of the proviral landscape. However, the composition of the HIV-1 reservoir is extremely variable, and it can be difficult to generalize the findings observed in a limited number of subjects in a single time point. In addition, the abundance and species richness of HIV-1 infected clones is still unpredictable and a small number of highly expanded clones can skew the global picture within each patient at a given time point.\nUnmet needs in measuring the latent reservoir\nThe development of assays that measure HIV-1 persistence has been invaluable in furthering our understanding of the impact of ART on viral replication and the nature of the latent reservoir. However, current methods have several limitations and the quantification of the latent reservoir remains challenging.Limit of detection and dynamic range are two of the biggest constraints of current assays, especially in the context of interventions based on purging of the reservoir or on very early treatment. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) can lead to dramatic reductions in the size of the latent reservoir (up to 4 logs) [55&#8211;57], making the detection of residual infected cells nearly impossible with the available sampling capacity, both in peripheral blood and in lymphoid tissues. Similar challenges are present when ART is initiated during the earliest phases of infection (eclipse to Fiebig I phases), as recently reported in two cases of hyper-acute infection diagnosed in the setting of PrEP trials [58]. Despite extensive testing with available assays, persistent virus may not be detected in such patients simply because no infected cells are present in the samples analyzed. The only practical approach is to intensively monitor viral rebound upon ART interruption. The duration of remission in the absence of ART and the rebound kinetics have been extremely informative. For example, mathematical models based on viral dynamics can relate the degree of reservoir reduction to the time to rebound after ART interruption. The models have been used to estimate both the efficacy of latent reservoir reduction strategies and the number of residual infected cells responsible for the rebound [59, 60]. In the cases of the Boston patients and the PrEP patient described by Henrich et al., such models predicted that only a few hundred cells harboring latent, replication competent HIV-1 were present in the patients at the time of ART interruption.These difficulties can be extrapolated to larger clinical trials involving new molecules aimed at reducing the latent reservoir, such as latency reversing agents (LRA), therapeutic vaccines, CAR T cells, and/or ADCC-competent broadly neutralizing anti-HIV-1 antibodies. In such trials, both the magnitude of changes in reservoir size and the scale of response to a given treatment might vary across study participants, requiring large sample sizes to demonstrate efficacy. In this context, the assay(s) used to quantify HIV-1 persistence would need adequate throughput to process hundreds of samples and be capable of reliably detecting even modest changes in reservoir size. As discussed above, approaches that allow the quantification of replication-competent proviruses are labor and time consuming, which makes them impractical for large cohort studies. PCR-based assays that measure HIV-1 DNA have a higher throughput, but cannot distinguish replication competent from defective proviruses. Infected cells carrying intact versus defective proviruses may respond very differently to a given intervention, and total HIV-1 DNA data could be difficult to interpret or even misleading, given the &#8220;background noise&#8221; of defective proviruses.Continuous efforts are needed to develop new approaches that can measure and characterize that true &#8220;minimal residual disease&#8221; that must be targeted by future curative strategies. We propose that the next generation of assays designed to measure the HIV-1 reservoir should have a low and &#8220;modular&#8221; limit of detection, a wide dynamic range, the capacity to distinguish intact proviruses, and should be scalable for studies with large samples sizes. As the need for such assays in clinical trials grows, rigorous studies to qualify or validate such assays will be important, and the clinical utility of any given assay will need to be formally established. It is our view that efforts to design and implement new assays for the HIV-1 latent reservoir will ultimately help to enable the discovery and development of new therapeutics aimed at curing the infection.", "pmid": "29433524", "title": "Measuring replication competent HIV-1: advances and challenges in defining the latent reservoir", "journal_title": "Retrovirology", "authors": "Zheng Wang;Francesco R.

Having started neuropathology diagnostic services in 2004, ours is a relatively new center. Intraoperative consultations were started in 2005. Agreement according to tumor/lesion type and grade between intraoperative and final histopathologic diagnosis in 333 neurosurgical samples received by the Department of Pathology is being reviewed here. Diagnostic accuracy of intraoperative reporting of central nervous system (CNS) lesions has been analyzed in many studies before. This study is different in that the agreement patterns at an upcoming center have been analyzed according to tumor/lesion type and grade. The common areas of errors and lessons learnt are discussed.\nMaterials and Methods\nA retrospective analysis of agreement patterns of intraoperative CNS lesion reporting on fresh unfixed tissue with final histopathology reporting on formalin fixed tissue was performed. Records of 5 year duration, from 2005 to 2009, were accessed. Cases where both, fresh unfixed tissue for intraoperative reporting and formalin fixed tissue for final histopathology diagnosis was not available were excluded from the study. All the other cases were taken up for analysis to avoid any selection bias. Final histopathology reports (considered the gold standard used for the diagnosis of the lesions) were based solely on the findings of formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue to achieve the masking effect. The earlier issued intraoperative report did not have a bearing on the final reports.This retrospective study was carried out on archival material. Patient confidentiality was protected. As per the policy of the Institutional Ethics Committee, such projects are exempt from ethical review.In all, there were 333 cases where both, intraoperative fresh unfixed and later, formalin fixed tissue samples, were received. Intraoperative reporting was done on the basis of crush smears and frozen sections both. For crush smears, toluidine blue staining was done as the first choice and if additional smears were available hematoxylin and eosin staining was also applied. Agreement between intraoperative and final histopathologic diagnosis was classified into four categories: (I) Grade in agreement, but type not in agreement; (II) grade not in agreement but type in agreement; (III) grade and type both not in agreement; (IV) grade and type both in agreement.Pattern of analysis followed was same for neoplastic and non-neoplastic lesions. However, since there is no grade for non-neoplastic lesions, agreement for the broad categories of inflammatory/infective/malformations was taken to be an agreement of &#8216;grade&#8217;. If the finer details like the infection being tuberculous in nature or type of inflammation being acute or chronic also matched then it was considered as agreement of &#8216;type&#8217;.For the neoplastic lesions, the agreement pattern was further analyzed for different categories of tumors: Astrocytic; oligodendroglial; ependymal; choroid plexus tumors; neuronal and mixed neuronal glial tumors; embryonal tumors; cranial and spinal nerve tumors; meningeal tumors; tumors of the hemopoietic system; tumors of the sellar region; metastatic tumors of the CNS; cysts (tumor like conditions); mixed gliomas. Intraoperative reporting of a tumor as low grade was considered to be in agreement with final grading as World Health Organization (WHO) Grade I and II and intraoperative high-grade in agreement with WHO Grade III and IV on final diagnosis.\nStatistical analysis\nConfidence interval (CI) of agreements was calculated for various categories of neoplastic as well as non-neoplastic lesions. CI was also calculated for groups where n &#215; p and n &#215; (1-p) were more than 5, i.e., fulfilled the requirement of the central limit theorem.\nResults\nOf the total of 333 CNS lesions received, 284 were neoplastic and 49 non-neoplastic, 289 cranial and 44 spinal, 196 intra-axial and 137 extra-axial. Maximum patients (209) belonged to 20-59 years age group, 83 were 0-19 years and the remaining (41) were more than 60 years of age.Of the 49 non-neoplastic lesions, one case fell into the agreement category I, two cases in agreement category III and there was agreement of both &#8216;grade&#8217; and type of lesion in the remaining 46 non- neoplastic lesions [Figure 1].Among the 284 neoplastic lesions, there were 21 cases in agreement category I, 17 in II, 9 in III and 237 in IV [Figure 2]. On analyzing the accuracy of intraoperative reporting according to tumor type, the breakup of agreement category was: Astrocytic: 2 (I), 16 (II), 2 (III), 86 (IV); oligodendroglial: 8 (I), 1 (II); ependymal: 2 (III), 6 (IV); embryonal: 23 (IV); cranial and spinal nerve tumors: 2 (II), 21 (IV); choroid plexus tumors: 4 (IV); meningeal tumors: 3 (I), 1 (III), 49 (IV); metastatic tumors: 3 (I), 17 (IV); cysts: 14 (IV); neuronal and mixed neuronal glial tumors: 1 (III); malignant lymphoma: 1 (III); sellar tumors: 17 (IV); and mixed gliomas: 5 (I) [Figure 3].Combining the neoplastic and non-neoplastic lesions the distribution of agreement [Figure 4] and 95% CI was as follows: 22 (6.6%) lesions were in agreement category I with 95% CI: 3.94-9.3; category II had 17 (5.1%) cases and 95% CI: 2.74-7.5; category III with 11 (3.3%) cases showed a 95% CI: to be 1.38-5.2; 283 (85%) cases were in agreement category IV having a 95% CI: of 81.15-88.80. CI: was also calculated for groups where n &#215; p and n &#215; (1 &#8722; p) were more than 5, i.e., fulfilled the requirement of central limit theorem. There were only two such groups viz. Astrocytic tumors in agreement category II and IV. For agreement category II 95% CI was 8.28-21.9 and for IV it was 73.68-88.6.On analyzing the composition of the different agreement categories it was seen that the major constituent of agreement category I were oligodendrogliomas and mixed gliomas; astrocytomas were predominant in agreement category II; agreement category III was not dominated by any particular type and was comprised of varying types of tumors viz. astrocytic, meningeal, cranial/spinal nerve, neuronal and mixed neuronal-glial, ependymal tumors and malignant lymphoma; category IV was dominated by astrocytic tumors followed by meningeal, embryonal, cranial/spinal nerve, metastases, sellar tumors, cysts (tumor-like), ependymal and choroid plexus tumors [Figure 5a&#8211;d].\nDiscussion\nAccuracy of intraoperative diagnosis has been studied at many reputed neuropathology centers and ranges from 83% to 95.29%.[12] This is slightly lower than the diagnostic accuracy of intraoperative reporting in general surgical specimens.[3] At our hospital, intraoperative neuropathology diagnostic services were started about 8 years back. This study was conducted with the aim of identifying problem areas of CNS intraoperative reporting in a new center like ours, with reference to typing and grading. Intraoperative pathology evaluation was done using squash smears and frozen sections both. Cytology technique has been more useful for astrocytoms, small round cell tumors and certain metastasis. Frozen section is reported to be better for the diagnosis of meningiomas, reactive lesions, ependymomas and most metastatic lesions. Using a combination of the two techniques is most beneficial.[45]Of the non-neoplastic lesions, one case fell into the agreement category I. This was a case of tuberculous lesion on final histopathology reporting. However, no necrosis or epithelioid cell granuloma could be seen on intraoperative smears and frozen section. There were two cases in agreement category III. One of these cases was an abscess, but the area of reactive gliosis received intraoperatively was reported as a low grade glioma. The second case, an infarct, was reported as a high-grade glioma primarily because of the high cellularity and microvascular proliferation. There was agreement of both &#8216;grade&#8217; and type of lesion in the remaining 46 (93.9%) non-neoplastic lesions. In non-neoplastic lesions, clues to be looked for are: The presence of macrophages should strongly suggest the possibility of a non-neoplastic process, such as demyelination, infection or infarction. An exception to the dictum that macrophages always indicate a non-neoplastic lesion is the tumor that has been treated with surgery, chemotherapy or radiotherapy, causing tissue damage to which macrophages naturally respond;[1] it is also true that macrophages may not be seen early in the evolution of an infarct. In this non-neoplastic condition capillary endothelial cells and pericytes enlarge and to some extent, multiply. The hypertrophy of microvascular cells superficially resembles the vascular hyperplasia of malignant gliomas.[6] As compared with normal parenchyma and reactive processes, low-grade astrocytomas smear more easily, showing higher cellularity, increased cell dimensions, a certain degree of pleomorphism and more evident cell borders;[7] presence of Scherer's secondary structures, cell distribution and tumor architecture in gliomas can be of help.[8]Pattern of intraoperative reporting was analyzed for neoplastic lesions also. The number of cases received was <10 for some groups viz. oligodendroglial, ependymal, mixed gliomas, choroid plexus tumors, malignant lymphoma and neuronal-mixed neuronal glial tumors. The outcome reveals that grading and typing both were in agreement in 100% of embryonal, sellar, choroid plexus tumors and cysts/tumor like conditions, followed by meningeal (92.5%), cranial and spinal nerve (87.5%), astrocytic (81.1%) and ependymal (75%) tumors. Overall 83.5% (95% CI: 79.13-87.8) of neoplastic lesions fell in agreement category (IV) i.e., both grade and type of intraoperative reporting matched with the final diagnosis. Though grading was accurate, but precise typing could not be performed (agreement category I) in 7.4% (95% CI: 4.35-10.4) neoplastic lesions. These included all five mixed gliomas, eight oligodendrogliomas, three cases of metastasis, three meningeal and three astrocytic tumors. The mixed gliomas, oligodendrogliomas and astrocytic tumors mentioned here were all bracketed as &#8220;glial tumors&#8221;. In the authors&#8217; experience, the trademark perinuclear haloes of oligodendrogliomas being absent on squashes or frozen sections, appreciating the prominent cytologic uniformity and roundness of the tumor cell defined in earlier studies[9] requires some practice. The three meningeal tumors in agreement category I were high-grade and it was difficult to identify the cell of origin intraoperatively. Failure to recognize atypia in meningiomas has been reported to be a potential pitfall in earlier studies also.[4] Similarly, typing of the nature of metastases was not possible in three cases. Though typing could be done accurately, grading was inaccurate (agreement category II) in 6.0% (95% CI: 3.23-8.7) neoplastic lesions. This group comprised of 16 (15.1%) astrocytic and one oligodendroglial tumor. The primary reason for inaccurate grading of astrocytic tumors was ambiguity on features of a high-grade i.e., pleomorphism, endothelial proliferation, mitosis or necrosis. The oligodendroglial tumor in this group was graded higher because of misinterpretation of proliferating vascular network. There were a total of 3.3% (95% CI: 1.13-5.2) cases where neither typing nor grading could be done intraoperatively (agreement category III). These included two astrocytic tumors and one neuronal-mixed neuronal glial tumor, which were reported as reactive gliosis; one case of rhabdoid meningioma where the rhabdoid cells were mistaken to gemistocytic and the tumor reported as low grade astrocytic tumor; two cranial/spinal nerve sheath tumors which were reported as granulation tissue; two high-grade ependymal tumors reported as low grade astrocytic; one case of malignant lymphoma as chronic inflammatory process.Most studies do not report upon the level of correlation between intraoperative and final diagnosis. Though there have been studies assessing overall accuracy of intraoperative reporting in CNS lesions, very few have analyzed the details of it. Uematsu et al.[10] have clarified the accuracy as complete correlation (intraoperative diagnosis exactly the same as the final diagnosis); partial correlation (intraoperative diagnosis was not incorrect but was too broad to qualify as a complete correlation); no correlation (intraoperative diagnosis was incorrect and different from the final diagnosis). They concluded the accuracy of their intraoperative reporting as complete (87.8%), partial (7.8%) and no (4.4%) correlation. Our study further defines the partial correlation group as grade in agreement, but type not in agreement (I) and grade not in agreement but type in agreement (II). Moreover, both parameters i.e., type and group of the CNS neoplasm have their own clinical relevance. This also prompted the authors to analyze, in routine intraoperative reporting, which tumors are more susceptible to errors in reporting their type and which ones their grade. This awareness, it is believed, would lead to assimilation of more radiological, per operative and cytological details for bringing about an improvement in intraoperative CNS lesion reporting.Shuangshoti et al[11] reported partial correlation in 13%, complete in 83% and none in 4%. A recent study by Ahmad et al.[12] has shown the correlation between the intraoperative frozen sections with final diagnosis on permanent sections. The concordant diagnostic frequency in their study is 97.08%. Our results are comparable to the previous studies. If agreement category IV is taken to be &#8216;complete correlation&#8217; diagnostic accuracy was seen in 85% cases. Agreement categories I and II can be considered as &#8216;partial correlation&#8217; and there were 6.6% and 5.1% cases respectively in these groups. &#8216;No correlation&#8217; group, which is equivalent to our agreement category III had 3.3% cases. Problem areas reported in earlier studies related to accuracy of intraoperative diagnosis are: Grading of gliomas, diagnosis of undifferentiated metastatic carcinomas, primitive neuroectodermal tumors, sarcomas, rare types of histology such as gliomatosis and xanthomatous lesions,[9] failure to recognize atypia in meningiomas.[4]While astrocytic tumors formed the major group where both grading and typing were accurate, they were also the major constituent of the category where grading did not correlate. Oligodendrogliomas and mixed gliomas were the most common tumors, which were difficult to type. Rarer variants of tumors and lesions with lymphoid cell population, spindle cell or mixed type of cellular composition were more liable to be misdiagnosed. The findings of this study may assist the upcoming centers of neuropathology as well as the post graduate students pursuing neuropathology. The impact needs to be evaluated. This study may also forewarn upcoming centers of neuropathology about the potential problem areas of intraoperative reporting in CNS lesions.Apart from squash smears, imprint cytology is also used in few neuropathology centers, but after intensive literature search it may be concluded that both squash and imprint smear examination of lesions of CNS are useful, quick and reliable diagnostic tools. However, squash smear examination is superior to imprint smears because of its better sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy.[13] It was found that some authors have reported a better diagnostic accuracy with imprint smears[14] and their centers have acquired a remarkable proficiency in intraoperative imprint smear reporting-especially with stereotactic biopsies. However, a sizeable amount of the literature in scientific journals and textbooks also exists on squash/crush smear features.[15] In fact, some studies have also reported a superior sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy with squash smears as compared with imprint smears.[13]To summarize, it was found that the overall accuracy of intraoperative reporting of CNS lesions at a new center does not differ significantly from the longer established ones. The problem areas encountered are almost the same. Non-neoplastic lesions provide a better intraoperative diagnostic accuracy. Among the neoplastic lesions grading of astrocytic and typing of oligodendroglial and mixed gliomas may constitute a problem area at new centeres. The lesions more likely to be misdiagnosed intraoperatively are the rarer variants of tumors or lesions having lymphoid cell population, spindle cell or mixed type of cellular composition. Appreciating the nuances of cellular and architectural morphology may better with experience. Better inputs about clinical and radiological features and experience with the appreciation of cellular features are likely to yield better outcome.To the best of authors&#8217; knowledge, agreement patterns of intraoperative reporting in CNS lesions have neither been analyzed in the context of newly established neuropathology centers nor qualified according to agreement for tumor grade and type. This study at a center in its initial 5 years of being established may serve as a baseline to record any temporal improvement in diagnostic accuracy of intraoperative reporting of CNS lesions.", "pmid": "24130410", "title": "Analyzing agreement patterns of intraoperative central nervous system lesion reporting according to type and grade", "journal_title": "Journal of Cytology / Indian Academy of Cytologists", "authors": "Sujata Chaturvedi;Ishita Pant;Rakesh Dua;Sanjeev Gupta", "doi": "10.4103/0970-9371.117677", "score": "0.014484225"}, {"keywords": "Gastroesophageal reflux disease;Diet;Fat;Meal volume;Caloric density", "abstract": "Background:  To identify the association of total diet and individual meals with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).\n Methods: This age- and sex-matched case-control study was carried out among 217 subjects (106 cases and 111 controls). Data were collected using a demographic questionnaire and a GERD checklist and a 3-day food record. \nResults: Cases consumed more fat (median: 26.3 [3.2-71.5] g vs. 21.8 [4.3-58.1] g; P=0.04)and more energy percent form carbohydrates (median: 72.5 [0-100] vs. 69.0 [0-100]; P=0.02)at lunch, and less energy (median: 129.5 kcal [0-617.6] vs. 170.5 kcal [0-615.7]; P=0.01) and protein (2.4 [0-19.4] g vs. 3.1 [0-21.8] g; P=0.01) at evening snack, compared to controls.The volume of food was significantly different between the two group only at lunch (median:516 [161-1292] g vs. 468 [198-1060] g; P=0.02). The percentage of energy from total dietary protein showed a significant association with GERD after adjusting for confounders (odds ratio[OR]=0.89; 95% CI: 0.81-0.98). Regarding the individual meals, amount of fat consumed at lunch (OR=1.02; 95% CI: 1.00-1.05), and amount of protein intake at evening snack (OR=0.92;95% CI: 0.85-1.00) were significantly associated with GERD. Meanwhile, caloric density and meal frequency did not differ significantly between the two groups. \nConclusion: Amount of fat consumed at lunch is positively associated with GERD, whereas the percentage of energy from total protein and amount of protein intake at evening snack are more likely to be inversely associated with GERD.", "body": "Introduction\n\nGastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD (is a health problem with a high prevalence and remarkable consequences such as esophageal stricture, gastrointestinal bleeding, or Barrett&#8217;s esophagus for those affected.1 It is a pathologic condition of the esophagus caused by regurgitation of gastric- or gastroduodenal contents into the lumen of the esophagus.2 Epidemiologic studies showed that the prevalence of GERD is between 10% to 48% in western countries and up to 5% in Asia3; however, an increasing trend is reported.4 In Iran, according to a population-based study,5 it is estimated to be up to 33% among adults. The typical symptoms of reflux are heartburn (a retrosternal burning sensation) and acid regurgitation (a sour taste in the mouth).6\nThe symptoms ofGERD can trigger esophagitis to such an extent as to lessen the patient&#8217;s quality of life.7 Furthermore, GERD is a strong risk factor for Barrett&#8217;s esophagus8 and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA).9 A systematic review on GERD indicated both absence from work and reduced productivity while at work.10 As the incidence of EA has increased in the world over the last 30 years,11 it is very important to identify factors which may affect the conditions leading to the development of GERD.\nDespite the importance of GERD and remarkable knowledge of its pathogenesis,12 risk factors remain poorly understood. However, there is considerable evidence that GERD occurs more commonly after meals.13,14 In this regard, majority of studies have been carried out from physiological,15,16 but not dietary perspective. They have investigated the effect of fat on postprandial esophageal acid exposure,17,18 or on lower esophageal sphincter (LES) motility.19,20 In addition, they were mostly in patients with severe GERD and even hospitalized patients with esophagitis and EA.21,22\nMost of the physiological studies failed to establish the role of diet (most notably fat) on GERD or altering the competence of LES junction.23,24 Even some suggested that recommending a low-fat diet to GERD patients is, however, an inappropriate approach.20,24 In contrary, some of the prior investigators demonstrated the association of fat with GERD.21,25 Therefore, relevant studies have often provided conflicting results.26,27\nGenerally, studies investigating the effect of total dietary intake on GERD are scarce.28,29 Amongst is a cross-sectional study by El-Serag et al28 in 371 employees at Veteran Administration in which a significant association was reported between high fat intake and GERD symptoms; however, having adjusted the effect of body mass index (BMI), the association became non-significant; since there is a significant association between obesity and GERD symptoms.30 A more recent study suggested that further work investigating the association between dietary fat intake and food sources of fat are needed for con&#64257;rmation of these results.31\nPresent physiological studies on meal volume and caloric density in GERD are inconclusive. Iwakiri et al32 reported a decrease in postprandial GERD by reducing the volume of a liquid meal in healthy volunteers. Pehl et al33 showed that the amount of gastroesophageal reflux induced by ingestion of a meal seems to depend on the volume but not on the caloric density of a meal. In contrast, the study by Colombo et al24 indicated that advice on dietary habits in GERD patients should be concentrated on decreasing the caloric load of meals rather than their fat content. However, Esmaillzadeh et al34 reported certain associations between dietary patterns and GERD, which may partly be modulated by body weight.\nHealth promotion of the population particularly those with GERD is important and to the best of our knowledge, the role of individual meals of diet on GERD has not been studied yet. Therefore, in the present study the association of total diet as well as individual meals was investigated to bridge the gap in this area.\nMaterials and Methods\n\n\nParticipants\n\nA total of 250 subjects consented to participate in our case-control study. Of these, 217 continued the study. The sample frame was selected among patients referred to the specialized clinic of Tabriz University of Medical Sciences for different health-seeking purposes. This clinic is the major provider of medical care in Tabriz, northwest of Iran. Enrolled subjects were all 14 years or older and were requested to complete an informed consent.\n\nStudy protocol\n\nSubjects were asked whether they had experienced recurrent heartburn, acid regurgitation, or both at least monthly during the prior 12 months; if so, they were referred to an experienced gastroenterologist for further investigation. Having confirmed the diagnosis of GERD, the subject was assigned to the case group. Age- and sex-matched subjects who did not experience any of the aforementioned symptoms over the past 12 months were selected as controls.\nSince heartburn and acid regurgitation are the two main symptoms of GERD, assessing these symptoms could be reliable to measure the true occurrence of reflux and to allow appropriate treatment.35,36 Therefore, these two symptoms are considered specific for GERD.37 They can be used to make the diagnosis of GERD without additional tests.38\nTherefore, GERD diagnosis was based on a GERD symptom checklist. This included specific questions about the type and frequency (at least weekly or monthly) of symptoms. Endoscopy, being invasive, was offered only to suspected patients, if they had consent.\nThe following exclusion criteria were applied at baseline: gastric surgery, esophageal or gastric cancer, history of vagotomy, confirmed peptic ulcer disease, dieting such as weight loss diet, use of LES-motility changing drugs such as calcium-channel blockers and nitrates, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), H2 receptors antagonists (H2-RA), and contraceptive/hormonal medications. Antacid medication, if positive, was stopped one month prior to food record.\n\nMeasurements\n\nData including age, marital status, education level, occupation, smoking and post-menopausal status were also gathered and BMI was calculated as weight (kg)/ height (M2) according to Quetelet&#8217;s formula.39 Furthermore, the interviewed subjects were sent home with a 3-day food record diary in order to provide more accurate and reliable estimation of food intake. To meet this demand, type and amount of dietary macronutrient components, consumed on two weekdays and one weekend in each meal were questioned. Subjects were instructed by a trained dietitian to consume their usual diet. Meanwhile, they were trained on how to fill out the diary. Upon the form completion, an in-person interview was conducted with subjects so as to be ensured that those foods recorded were typical of their routine diet. Then, the data on total diet as well as each meal were analyzed using Nutritionist III software (Axxya Systems, Stafford, TX), modified for Iranian foods. Caloric density of foods was calculated as the available energy per unit weight of food (kcal/g) excluding non-caloric beverages and drinking water. The sample size was estimated, based on mean fat intake with 80% power and &#945;-error of 5% and a case to control ratio of 1:1, using literature-derived data40; the effect size for dietary fat was 2.4 g (standard deviation [SD] = 6). It was predicted that 99 persons in each group would detect changes in serum dietary parameters, using the two-means formula. However, we recruited 217 persons (106 cases and 111 controls) for the study.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nStatistical analysis of the data was carried out using SPSS version 16 for Windows (PASW Statistics; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). For all continuous variables, median and range were presented and X2 was performed to test associations of categorical variables. Mann-Whitney U test and student t test were used for comparing means of variances between the two groups. The association of GERD with specific risk factors was reported as odds ratio (OR) and 95% CI, using a logistic regression model that &#8220;no reflux&#8221; was the reference category. Univariate logistic regression was performed to evaluate the association between GERD and dietary items. Furthermore, the associations were assessed based on fitting multiple logistic regression models adjusted for BMI and education level. All calculated P values were two-sided and P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.\nResults\n\nOut of 250 participants who filled out the GERD checklist, 217 returned their dietary records with complete and interpretable answers, among whom 106 (48.8%) had experienced GERD symptoms (case group) with a mean age (&#177;SD) of 35.3 &#177; 12.6 years and 111 (51.2%) were controls with a mean age of 35.1 &#177; 13.2 years. Only education level differed significantly between cases and controls (P < 0.001; Table 1).\nAmong 106 cases, 69 (65.1%) had at least weekly symptoms while 37 (34.9%) complained of monthly symptoms. Total diet and individual meals of the participants are summarized in Table 2. Cases and controls showed statistically non-significant differences. Even though cases reported further total energy intake when compared to controls (median, 1922.5 kcal vs. 1882 kcal), however, their difference did not reach a significant level. Both groups consumed similar amounts of carbohydrates (median, 265.7 g vs. 272.1 g), protein (median, 60.6 g vs. 63.7 g), and fat (median, 62.4 g vs. 61.4 g). Similarly, the intake of other nutrients was more or less the same. Meanwhile, total caloric density, total meal volume and frequency did not differ significantly between the two groups (Table 3). In contrast, statistically significant differences were observed between participants with and without GERD at lunch and evening snack for the following dietary items; at lunch: amount of fat (P = 0.04) and meal volume (P = 0.02), and at evening snack: energy intake (P = 0.01), amount of protein (P = 0.01), fat (P = 0.01), and sugar (P = 0.03), and percentage of energy from carbohydrates (P = 0.02). Amount of carbohydrates and caloric density at evening snack were marginally significant (P = 0.05).\nResults of multivariate logistic regression revealed significant associations between GERD and percentage of energy from protein (OR = 0.89; 95% CI: 0.81-0.98) in total diet; amount of fat (OR = 1.02; 95% CI:1.00-1.05) at lunch; amount of sugar (OR = 0.95; 95% CI:0.91-0.99) and energy intake (OR = 0.99; 95% CI:0.99-1.00) at evening snack with GERD after adjusting for BMI and education level (Table 4).\nDiscussion\n\nBecause GERD is an important health problem and modification of dietary behavior appears to play a role in its prevention, we studied the association of total diet as well as individual meals (including large meals and snacks) with GERD. The results showed that among total dietary factors, only percentage of energy from total protein was significantly associated with GERD.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is a preliminary study that examined the association of total diet as well as individual meals (including large meals and snacks) with GERD. Our study demonstrated that total dietary intakes of cases and controls did not differ significantly. In addition, total dietary factors had no significant association with GERD, except for percentage of energy from total protein. It could be in part explained by the fact that protein increases the LES pressure and stimulates gastrin secretion which promotes stomach emptying.41,42 Prior investigators have postulated a pathophysiologic relationship between delayed gastric emptying,43 decreased LES pressure25 and GERD.\nEl-Serag et al28 reported significantly higher daily intakes of total fat, saturated fatty acids, percentage of energy from fat, and average fat servings in GERD patients comparing with healthy subjects. Moreover, there was a dose-response relationship between GERD and fatty acids and cholesterol. Though after adjusting for BMI, the association between fat and GERD was non-significant, however, in their study food intake was only evaluated by a food frequency questionnaire which is prone to recall bias, whereas in our study a 3-day food record was obtained, the gold standard tool of dietary assessment.44\nIn another study,33 performed on 60 patients with reflux, perceived reflux event was significantly associated with higher intakes of cholesterol, saturated fatty acids, and calories from fat.This study demonstrated that BMI did not correlate with having a sensed reflux event. However, their study suffered not only from a small number of patients, but also it lacked control group. In contrary, our study had adequate power to detect the differences between the two groups and had control group as well. In a study by Nandurkar et al,29 no significant association was found between diet and reflux symptoms in 211 community subjects.\nIn our study, there was a great variability in reported amount of foods consumed particularly at meals in both groups (Table 2). In addition, it is unknown whether GERD patients had altered their diet at the time of the study, since GERD patients are often advised to adjust their dietary habit, e.g. by minimizing the intake of high-fat meals or excluding offending foods to avoid symptoms. Nonetheless, some of the patients with non-severe GERD were reluctant to change their diet despite persisting symptoms; perhaps, because of the pleasure of eating those foods. Besides, it is not clear whether patients were exposed to symptoms at the time of food record, or it influenced the type and amount of the food consumed. The above mentioned factors may interfere with significant associations between total diet and GERD.\nAlthough it was revealed that there is almost no significant association between total dietary intake and GERD, several food items consumed at certain meals were found to be associated. For example, as expected, a significant association was found at lunch for amount of fat and marginally for meal volume. Lunch comprised the largest and main meal among most individuals. In addition, an enhanced volume might increase GERD via an enhanced gastric distension; thereby, triggering transient LES relaxations (TLESRs), considered the predominant mechanisms of reflux events in healthy subjects and reflux patients.33 On the other hand, extracellular fats are widely used at lunch. Therefore, fat consumption at lunch might contribute to postprandial GERD symptoms.\nUnlike lunch, it appears that evening snack is more likely to show a protective effect of energy, protein, fat, and sugar on GERD, regardless of the type and the food consumed. More interestingly, fat consumed at lunch provokes GERD symptoms; whilst at evening snack alleviates the symptoms. However, the mechanism (s) for such an effect is unclear; but as fat is consumed in different forms (e.g. intracellular vs. extracellular fat) and in varying proportions with other macronutrients, hence, the physiologic response to fat ingestion may potentially vary from one meal/snack to another.45 In our study, fat was used in extracellular form at lunch, while it was ingested in intracellular form at evening snack, i.e. in the form of sweets, cakes, biscuits and junk foods. Therefore, the form of the consumed fat (e.g. intracellular vs. extracellular fat) might explain the present finding.\nGiven that sweets have been regarded as causing reflux because of their high osmolality and high fat content, it is expected to have more links with GERD at evening snack. However, it seems to be unlikely at least in our study; since this snack had minor volume of fat, sugar, carbohydrates, and so on, especially in GERD patients (Table 4); that is why the effect is more likely to be reversed. Although snacking may promote energy imbalance resulting in obesity among different age groups,46 our results suggest evening snacking might protect GERD patients against the disease.\n\nLimitations \n\nWe acknowledge some limitations. This is a clinical-based, but not a population-based study. However, as mentioned above, we used the clinic of Tabriz Medical University which is a major provider of medical care in Tabriz, northwest of Iran. In addition, misclassification might exist since endoscopy was not offered to all patients, due to low compliance, however, suspected cases were not included and only those who had at least monthly symptoms of GERD were recruited. Finally, we could not investigate the association between diet and reflux severity.\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, to promote health among population, particularly patients with GERD, dietary modification through following dietary guidelines and meal management and having appropriate food choices in each meal play an important role in the management of GERD. Our results indicate the protective effect of the percentage of energy from protein in total diet. It also shows that lunch and evening snack are associated with GERD symptoms. Seemingly, amount of fat at lunch positively affects GERD, whereas amount of macronutrients at evening snack reduces the symptoms, provided that the meal volume be low. Therefore, recommending a low-fat meal, particularly at lunch, to GERD patients sound reasonable. This is clinically important and may be suggested in the guideline for management of GERD. The increasing prevalence of patients with GERD along with inappropriate dietary habits merits evaluation of a proper dietary intervention for GERD and its symptoms. Large-scale studies are required to evaluate the impact of total diet as well as individual meals on symptoms.\nThe recommendation for practical implications and policy making\n\nRegarding the important effect of diet in the management of GERD, it seems sound to accentuate more on dietary items in the current guidelines of GERD.\nEthical approval\n\nThe Ethics Committee of Tabriz University of Medical Sciences approved the protocol for the study (Reference Number: 5/4/11127).\nCompeting interests\n\nThe authors report no competing interests.\nAuthors\u2019 contribution\n\nEM M contributed in the study design, data interpretation, and appraised the manuscript.

An important mechanism that allows the transport of large molecules across the BBB is specific binding to receptors that internalize and release the ligand across the capillary endothelium (e.g., the transferrin receptor [TfR]&#8208;transferrin pair).3, 4 The TfR present on capillary endothelium binds and internalizes the ligand, subsequently releasing it on the luminal side of the endothelial cell into the brain tissue. Multiple attempts have been made in the past to utilize this system for delivery of therapeutic antibodies across the BBB.5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 In previous studies, micro doses of radiolabeled antibody with a high affinity against TfR successfully crossed the vascular wall.10 Yet, whether the antibodies penetrated into the brain at pharmacologically relevant doses remained to be tested.Previous works have clearly demonstrated the existence of a nonmonotonic relationship between brain uptake and affinity of anti&#8208;TfR antibodies in the mouse.11, 12 These studies utilized anti&#8208;TfR as the brain targeting arm (affinity ranging from 10s&#8211;1000s of nM), and anti&#8208;BACE1 (&#946;&#8208;amyloid precursor protein cleavage enzyme) as the therapeutic arm. BACE1 is an enzyme that cleaves membrane amyloid precursor protein and releases soluble A&#946; into the brain interstitium. Inhibition of BACE1 activity leads to reduction in soluble&#8208;A&#946; levels in the brain, which serves as an easily measured preclinical brain&#8208;pharmacodynamic (PD) readout.The authors showed that high affinity anti&#8208;TfR antibodies bound TfR tightly and were subsequently internalized but degraded in lysosomes. Therefore, they were less likely to be released from the TfR and penetrate into the brain tissue.13 On the other hand, very low affinity anti&#8208;TfR antibodies were not efficiently transported across the BBB because of low binding to TfR.11, 12 Antibodies with intermediate affinity to TfR yielded the best delivery by balancing binding of TfR on the luminal side and efficient release to the brain tissue. Subsequently, antibodies were generated against cynomolgus monkey TfR that demonstrated BBB penetration and delivery into the brain tissue.14 In this cynomolgus monkey study, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A&#946; was used as a biomarker for brain A&#946;. Previous studies have demonstrated that A&#946; lowering in the CSF was predictive of the A&#946; lowering in the brains in mice, rats, and guinea pigs for various enzymes involved in cleavage of amyloid precursor protein.15 Accordingly, previous pharmacokinetic&#8208;pharmacodynamic (PK&#8208;PD) models for small molecule inhibitors of amyloid precursor protein cleavage have successfully utilized CSF A&#946; level as readout for the PD effect of the drug in the brain.16\nInterestingly, the optimal anti&#8208;TfR affinity required for maximal brain exposure was different in mice when compared to cynomolgus monkeys.12, 14 In mice, lower affinity anti&#8208;TfR bispecifics (with equilibrium dissociation constant, KD&#8201;&#8764;&#8201;600 nM) penetrated the brain better than higher anti&#8208;TfR affinity bispecifics (KD&#8201;&#8764;&#8201;32 nM). In contrast, the trend seemed to be shifted in cynomolgus monkeys, with higher affinity antibodies (KD&#8201;&#8764;&#8201;37 nM) penetrating better than the lower affinity antibodies (KD&#8201;&#8764;&#8201;1650 nM). To identify the antibody characteristics that would result in maximal brain exposure, it was important to quantify the relationship between brain exposure and affinity of antibodies for TfR in a primate model.Previously, Gadkar et al.17 developed a PK&#8208;PD model for anti&#8208;TfR/BACE1 antibodies in mice. The model accounts for target&#8208;mediated clearance of anti&#8208;TfR bispecific antibodies in plasma using a Michaelis&#8208;Menten approximation and related TfR&#8208;affinity to antibody uptake into the brain tissue using an empirical function fitted to data from three different anti&#8208;TfR/BACE1 bispecifics of varying TfR affinity and one non&#8208;TfR binding antibody. The model successfully described the nonmonotonic TfR affinity&#8208;dependence for brain uptake of antibody and thus A&#946; reduction in the brain. However, data from multiple anti&#8208;TfR/BACE1 antibodies are needed to parametrize the relationships between binding affinity and the target&#8208;mediated processes of clearance and brain uptake. Furthermore, the form of the empirical function for brain uptake of antibody was chosen ad hoc based on data from numerous anti&#8208;TfR/BACE1 bispecifics. The translational relevance of this empirical model is not known, nor is its applicability to other potential shuttling mechanisms that may be of interest in the future.This article presents a novel PK&#8208;PD model with mechanistic detail for systemic target&#8208;mediated clearance and the affinity&#8208;dependent brain uptake that have been calibrated and validated for data from the cynomolgus monkey and utilized for predictions of potential human studies. The model accounts for systemic&#8208;clearance and brain&#8208;uptake by representing anti&#8208;TfR interactions in systemic compartment and at the BBB, respectively. Finally, the model represents the A&#946; production and clearance in the brain, and the PD readout of brain A&#946; reduction in response to inhibition of the BACE1 enzyme. This model was first calibrated with previously published cynomolgus monkey PK&#8208;PD data obtained using two anti&#8208;TfR/BACE1 bispecific antibodies. PK&#8208;PD data from three additional bispecific antibodies with different affinities were reserved for model validation. We show that the model quantitatively predicts the systemic pharmacokinetic (PK) and CSF A&#946; reduction for these three additional antibodies without requiring additional tuning of parameters or model structure. The model was then applied to predict the optimal affinity in the cynomolgus monkeys and translational predictions for ideal anti&#8208;TfR bispecific antibodies in humans. This work allows for greater insight into the multiple mechanisms, including steps in the transcytosis process, by which anti&#8208;TfR affinity influences brain uptake. Thus, it will aid in the design of anti&#8208;TfR antibodies with optimal affinity and subsequent clinical studies to maximize the therapeutic potential for this brain&#8208;targeting platform. Furthermore, using this framework, we compare expected target engagement for anti&#8208;TfR bispecific antibodies and its corresponding bivalent antibodies. We demonstrate that the most suitable choice depends on the target level, target turnover rate, and dosing regimen, and therefore the anti&#8208;TfR bispecific platform should not be treated as a &#8220;one size fits all&#8221; solution to targeting in the brain.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nStructural model development\nThe PK&#8208;PD model includes two modules: systemic PK, which interacts with brain&#8208;uptake that ultimately drives the downstream PD. The systemic PK is represented with a two&#8208;compartment model along with a mechanistic representation of target&#8208;mediated drug disposition whereby the antibody clears from the body because of TfR&#8208;binding and degradation (Figure\n1\na). The novel representation of brain&#8208;uptake depicted in Figure\n1\nb, is based on two mechanisms of transcytosis. The first mechanism is TfR&#8208;mediated transcytosis. The antibody in the capillary reversibly binds to TfR at the BBB and the antibody&#8208;TfR complex irreversibly internalizes into the capillary endothelium. Once internalized, the antibody&#8208;TfR complex either dissociates or is degraded.13 The dissociated antibody can then be released into the brain. The second mechanism is the non&#8208;TfR&#8208;mediated uptake of antibodies into the brain via nonspecific mechanisms. It is assumed that all antibodies are passively cleared from the brain at the same rate. Active TfR&#8208;mediated clearance from the brain is considered to be subsumed within the passive clearance term because the measurements allow us to estimate the net flux of antibody from the central to brain compartment but not the individual influx and outflux terms.The PD module is based on continuous production and clearance of A&#946; (Figure\n1\nb). Engagement of BACE1 by the antibody reduces the production rate of A&#946;. This inhibition of the production rate of A&#946; is represented by a Hill function term within the production rate.16, 17\nThe detailed structure and the ordinary differential equations that describe the mechanistic model are provided in the Supplementary Material.\nCalibration and validation methodology\nModel parameters were optimized using particle swarm optimization. The application of particle swarm optimization to parameterizing a model that mechanistically represents complex biological processes has been described previously.18, 19 The objective function to be minimized was defined as the difference between model simulations and experimental measurements normalized by the SD of experimental measurement. Because particle swarm optimization is a heuristic method, it does not provide the precision for the parameter estimates. Rather, confidence in the model's predictive capability is established by showing successful prediction of additional data that were not used for parameter estimation. This approach of focusing on model predictions is utilized by &#8220;quantitative systems pharmacology&#8221; models because these models are typically underconstrained but contain several &#8220;sloppy parameters&#8221; whose precise values do not influence the predictions of interest.20, 21 Alternate parameterizations are considered in determining the confidence interval of predictions. Additional details for objective function evaluation and estimation of confidence intervals are provided in the Supplementary Material.\nTranslational scaling for predictions\nThe cynomolgus monkey PK&#8208;PD model was scaled to humans, as described earlier.22 Specifically, the clearance parameter was translated using allometric scaling with an exponent of 0.8 and the rest of the parameters were scaled 1:1 except for the A&#946; turnover rate in the brain. Based on measurements by Randall Bateman's laboratory, A&#946; turnover in humans was assumed to be 20% slower than that in cynomolgus monkeys.23, 24\n\nRESULTS\n\nModel calibration and validation\nCalibration was performed in two steps. First, the PK module was fitted to PK data for two anti&#8208;TfR antibodies (anti&#8208;TfR1/BACE1 and anti&#8208;TfR2/BACE1) and a nonspecific anti&#8208;gD antibody.14 This fitting provided values for the two&#8208;compartment PK parameters (compartment volumes, distributional clearance, and nonspecific elimination), as well as those associated with TfR&#8208;mediated clearance (TfR turnover in the central compartment and degradation rates of TfR&#8208;antibody complex; Table\n1, 2). The on rate and KD for antibody&#8208;TfR binding were set directly to values measured in vitro, without additional fitting (Table\n3). This approach decreases the number of degrees of freedom in the model and allows for a more robust estimation of the free parameters. Furthermore, it would enable direct use of in vitro measurements for in vivo predictions for future molecules. Figure\n2\na shows that the model is able to accurately describe antibody PK using the in vitro binding kinetics for binding to and unbinding from the receptor.Next, the brain uptake and PD modules were fit simultaneously based on the observed A&#946;&#8208;inhibition over 2 weeks after administration of the anti&#8208;TfR1 and anti&#8208;TfR2 antibodies. The brain&#8208;uptake module was also constrained by the levels of antibodies measured in the brain at 24 hours postdose.14 The estimated parameters for the brain&#8208;uptake module were those related to TfR turnover in brain capillary endothelium, internalization of TfR&#8208;antibody complex, nonspecific antibody internalization, and antibody release into and clearance from the brain. The PD module parameters were those related to the Hill equation parameters for inhibition of A&#946; production. Similar to the PK module, the brain&#8208;uptake module also utilized the in vitro measurements for binding and dissociation of the antibody to TfR, both at the BBB and inside the capillary endothelium. Figure\n2\na shows that the model is able to describe the A&#946; inhibition profile for both anti&#8208;TfR1 and anti&#8208;TfR2 antibodies well.Even after fixing the parameters for antibody&#8208;TfR binding&#8208;unbinding kinetics based on in vitro data, the model is not identifiable such that multiple distinct parameter sets reasonably fit the available PK and PD data for anti&#8208;TfR1, anti&#8208;TfR2, and anti&#8208;gD antibodies. Therefore, to assure that the model adequately captures transcytosis phenomenon in the brain, model predictions were validated using additional experimental data. Note that because the model parameters are set before this validation step, in silico predictions in line with experimental results provide confidence that the model captures the relevant biology and can then be used to investigate additional research questions.To robustly evaluate whether the model is able to capture the behavior of both arms of the antibody, model predictions were tested using data reserved for model validation corresponding to three additional antibodies: (1) anti&#8208;TfR1/nBACE1, antibody with the same high affinity anti&#8208;TfR arm and a higher&#8208;affinity anti&#8208;BACE1; (2) anti&#8208;TfR52/nBACE1, antibody with a low&#8208;intermediate affinity anti&#8208;TfR arm and the higher affinity anti&#8208;BACE1 arm; and (3) anti&#8208;TfR53/nBACE1, antibody with a high&#8208;intermediate affinity anti&#8208;TfR arm and the higher affinity anti&#8208;BACE1 arm.\nThe model correctly predicts PK and PD for antibodies with increased potency against BACE1\nA new bispecific antibody with the same anti&#8208;TfR1 arm and a higher affinity anti&#8208;BACE1 arm (anti&#8208;nBACE1) with four&#8208;times greater potency against BACE1 than the original anti&#8208;TfR/BACE1 was generated.14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 25, 26 The two anti&#8208;TfR1 antibodies exhibited the same plasma PK, supporting the assumption that binding to TfR is the major driver for target&#8208;mediated clearance and that binding to BACE1 does not have a measurable impact. Because anti&#8208;TfR1/BACE1 antibody was one of the antibodies used for model calibration, it was not surprising that the model fits the PK data for both antibodies with this same TfR1 arm well (Figure\n2\nb[i]). In order to predict the PD data for the anti&#8208;TfR1/nBACE1 antibody, the \nKmBACE parameter was reduced by fourfold, the factor by which anti&#8208;BACE1 and anti&#8208;nBACE1 differ in their potency against BACE1. As presented in Figure\n2\nb(ii), the model predicted the PD response to anti&#8208;TfR1/nBACE1 without any additional model&#8208;fitting (simulation vs. experiment in Supplementary Figure S1). Importantly, this validation provides confidence in the PD module and demonstrates that in vitro measurement for activity of antibody against BACE1 was sufficient to explain the observed change in PD response in vivo. Thus, the model can be used with increased confidence to explore the expected modulations in PD response with new anti&#8208;BACE1 arms.\nThe model correctly predicts PK and PD for antibodies with intermediate affinities against TfR\nTo capture the PK&#8208;PD relationship quantitatively in a species&#8208;dependent manner, the mechanistic model accounts for TfR level and turnover in primates, estimates for which were obtained during model calibration. Because these parameters cannot be tested directly, the brain&#8208;uptake module was validated by comparing model predictions with experimental data for two new antibodies against cynomolgus monkey TfR: anti&#8208;TfR53 (KD&#8722;143nM) and anti&#8208;TfR52 (KD&#8722;343nM).\nFigure\n2\nc demonstrates that the model developed based on the previous study with anti&#8208;TfR1 and anti&#8208;TfR2 antibodies predicts the PK and PD for both anti&#8208;TfR53 and anti&#8208;TfR52 well without any additional fitting (simulation vs. experiment in Supplementary Figure S1). The only model parameters altered were the kinetics for binding to TfR that were specified for each antibody based on results from a BiaCore binding assay. Thus, the concordant results establish confidence in the ability of the model to mechanistically and quantitatively capture the process of antibody transcytosis across the BBB and support the use of this semiquantitative model to predict PK&#8208;PD of anti&#8208;TfR bispecific antibodies in humans.\nPredicted optimal anti\u2010TfR affinity for humans\nThe cynomolgus monkey PK&#8208;PD model was extended to predict expected human serum PK and brain A&#946; kinetics (a measure of anti&#8208;BACE1 activity) for anti&#8208;TfR antibodies. Figure\n3\na(i&#8211;iv) shows the predicted human A&#946; inhibition profile by anti&#8208;TfR/BACE1 bispecific antibody for four different affinities against TfR, again indicating a biphasic relationship between affinity and A&#946; inhibition. For KD values of 2,000 to 20 nM, A&#946; inhibition improves with increasing affinity (decreasing KD). However, at higher affinity (KD&#8201;=&#8201;2nM), the inhibition of A&#946; is reduced. The relationship between peak and average A&#946; inhibition by anti&#8208;TfR/BACE1 bispecific antibodies of different affinity toward TfR is shown in Figure\n3\nb. The model predicts that an anti&#8208;TfR affinity in the range of 100 to 300 nM would be optimal for achieving maximal average as well as maximal peak A&#946; inhibition.\nComparative predictions for bivalent vs. anti\u2010TfR bispecific antibodies against generic target\nTo date, characterization of the anti&#8208;TfR bispecific antibody platform and its relative ability to improve brain uptake have been conducted using anti&#8208;BACE1 as the potential therapeutic target. BACE1 is not only an important target for Alzheimer's Disease, but also provides a robust PD readout that has been indirectly used to quantify improvements in brain uptake gained by using anti&#8208;TfR. Although anti&#8208;BACE1 has been used to support proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for the anti&#8208;TfR bispecific platform, other targets implicated in neurological disorders are also of interest. Furthermore, many proteins of interest in neurodegenerative diseases have been targeted by direct binding and inhibition.27, 28 Accordingly, we tested the application of an anti&#8208;TfR bispecific approach for improved delivery of antibodies that directly bind other brain targets. However, some targets may benefit more from increasing brain delivery, whereas others may benefit more from having two arms to bind the target. In addition, anti&#8208;TfR bispecific antibodies clear from the body much faster than typical bivalent antibodies because of TfR&#8208;mediated clearance, thus reducing exposure of anti&#8208;TfR bispecific relative to bivalent in the periphery. Therefore, to explore the potential impact of target characteristics on the relative advantages/disadvantages of using an anti&#8208;TfR bispecific format, we extended the model to account for a generic target &#8220;T&#8221; that is bound and neutralized by either an anti&#8208;TfR/anti&#8208;T bispecific antibody or an anti&#8208;T bivalent antibody. The model was then used to compare the level of target engagement achieved by either antibody format as compared to the baseline level of total target present in the brain.\nFigure\n4\na(i) demonstrates the percent target engagement by an anti&#8208;TfR bispecific antibody with KD of 100 nM against TfR and 1 nM against T, administered at 30 mg/kg i.v. every 4 weeks. Figure\n4\na(ii) demonstrates the percent target engagement by the bivalent antibody with two binding sites against that target with an affinity of 1 nM, administered in the same manner as anti&#8208;TfR bispecific. As expected, both antibodies are more effective against targets with lower steady&#8208;state concentration and longer elimination half&#8208;lives. On the other hand, if the steady&#8208;state concentration of target is too high and/or elimination half&#8208;life is too low, then both antibodies are relatively ineffective (<20%) at the specified dose level, despite marginally better neutralization using the bispecific antibody. The most interesting prediction is related to conditions wherein either the bispecific or the bivalent antibody provides a relative advantage, supporting that rational selection of the most appropriate antibody platform should take key target characteristics into account (Figure\n4\na[iii]). For this dosing regimen (30 mg/kg i.v. Q4W), there exists an intermediate range for targets with intermediate concentrations and elimination half&#8208;lives for which the anti&#8208;TfR bispecific platform offers a significant advantage (Figure\n4\na[iii]).In contrast, because of the target&#8208;mediated clearance associated with anti&#8208;TfR antibodies, if the dosing interval is extended (e.g., Q12W instead of Q4W) and the same comparison between bivalent and bispecific antibody is conducted, the advantage of anti&#8208;TfR bispecific platforms diminishes (Figure\n4\nb). Both antibodies are equally ineffective for targets with high expression level and fast turnover, but the bivalent antibody is actually more effective for targets with low level and low turnover rate (Figure\n4\nb[iii]).Thus, the relative efficiency of the bivalent vs. anti&#8208;TfR bispecific antibody format for binding a given central nervous system target is determined by target concentration, target turnover rates, and clinical dosing regimen. For each target and specific clinical requirements, the PK&#8208;PD framework from this model can be used to inform decision&#8208;making around the relative value of using the anti&#8208;TfR bispecific antibody platform over a standard antibody approach.\nDISCUSSION\nThe BBB limits the delivery of large molecules, including antibodies, into the brain. Consequently, achieving sufficient brain exposure to maintain therapeutically effective concentrations of drug poses a significant challenge to treatment of brain diseases with antibody therapeutics. Research into the biology of the BBB is ongoing and has already provided insight into mechanisms by which it regulates the passage of molecules from the vasculature into the brain. Previous works in mice and cynomolgus monkeys have studied and leveraged TfR&#8208;mediated transcytosis by using anti&#8208;TfR bispecific antibodies to improve transport into the brain.14 However, the complex relationship between the antibody affinity for TfR and the resulting brain exposure is not well understood.Gadkar et al.17 previously presented a PK&#8208;PD model for the behavior of murine anti&#8208;TfR bispecifics in mice to address the complex systemic and brain PK&#8208;PD relationships observed. However, the empirical representation of antibody&#8208;TfR interaction restricts the ability to adapt the model for primates and humans. Therefore, in this work, we developed a mechanistic PK&#8208;PD model that accounts for target&#8208;mediated clearance of anti&#8208;TfR/BACE1 bispecific antibody in plasma and affinity&#8208;dependent uptake into the brain by explicitly accounting for antibody&#8208;TfR interactions in plasma as well as on the brain endothelium. The model was extended to translate PK&#8208;PD predictions from cynomolgus monkey to human and thereby aid in design of a molecule for clinical development. The model was then further applied to explore the impact of a range of target parameters that also play a role in whether an anti&#8208;TfR bispecific platform provides any advantage over a standard anti&#8208;target bivalent antibody approach.One of the most interesting PK&#8208;PD outcomes of the model is the mechanistic explanation for the existence of an inverse &#8220;U&#8221; relationship between affinity against TfR and brain uptake of the antibody. Anti&#8208;TfR antibodies with high affinity monovalent binding to TfR clear rapidly from peripheral blood and result in degradation of TfR.14 Both of these phenomena result in low exposure to anti&#8208;TfR antibody in the brain. In contrast, anti&#8208;TfR antibodies with very low affinity to TfR have substantially better peripheral blood exposure because of reduced target&#8208;mediated clearance. However, maximal brain exposure of these antibodies is also low because of the extremely low affinity for TfR results in inefficient transport across the BBB. Correctly identifying the optimal affinity of the anti&#8208;TfR arm is therefore critical to support and optimize sustained exposure in the brain at or above a therapeutic threshold (dependent on the potency of the therapeutic arm; e.g., anti&#8208;BACE1). It is also important to note that, based on our mouse and monkey data, the optimal affinity of the anti&#8208;TfR arm is species&#8208;dependent, as well as target characteristics in the brain.Our model was extended to simulate expected target engagement by the bispecific and bivalent antibody for a target with given steady&#8208;state levels and turnover rates. Interestingly, the model revealed that there is no universal answer as to whether the bispecific antibody is better than the corresponding bivalent antibody. The answer depends on the dosing regimen as well as the target characteristics. For monthly dosing, TfR bispecifics are better at intermediate levels and turnover rates of the target, whereas for quarterly dosing, bivalent antibodies are better for targets at low level and low turnover rates. Accordingly, the anti&#8208;TfR bispecific platform cannot be treated as a panacea for improving the efficacy of all antibodies against targets in the brain, and should be evaluated for the relative advantage it is likely to confer on a case&#8208;by&#8208;case basis.Given that bispecific antibodies are typically more expensive to generate and develop than bivalent antibodies, the anti&#8208;TfR bispecific platform would be economically viable only if it offered a significant advantage over its bivalent counterpart. Therefore, the ability of this model to compare different antibody formats can be extremely useful in prioritizing which targets will benefit the most from the bispecific platform and define early experiments (both preclinical and clinical) to verify hypotheses related to drug effects rather than relying entirely on lengthy and expensive clinical trials. It should be noted that the overall paucity of quantitative information on central nervous system targets poses a significant challenge to generating model predictions with high confidence. Accordingly, it would be important to further characterize target biology and design efficient experiments in order to inform appropriate use of the model.Although the aforementioned analysis can be applied to a generalized target, it cannot be applied if the target is such that antibody activity requires both arms of antibody to be bound to the target simultaneously (e.g., antibodies that potentiate clustering of target receptor). In this case, a bivalent or higher order multivalent antibody approach is clearly required. Alternatively, if the mechanism of action of a candidate antibody involves activation of immune response (e.g., through engagement of Fc&#947; receptor), then the anti&#8208;TfR bispecific platform would also be excluded based on the requirement for no effector function. Anti&#8208;TfR bispecific antibodies with effector function have been previously shown to have acute and systemic toxicities; therefore this platform is restricted to targets that do not require the activation of Fc&#947; receptor pathway.12\nThe modeling and simulation framework described in this article are useful for interpretation of the data from bispecific antibodies within a single model structure and parameter set. This could be a helpful tool for identifying optimal characteristics for antibodies based on the mechanism of action of the therapeutic arm. Finally, the described modeling and simulation framework could predict the profile of expected human response for a specific antibody against a specific target. Thus, this modeling and simulation framework can play a prospectively instrumental role in specifying criteria for designing optimal clinical candidates and efficient clinical studies to enable faster development of the therapeutic bispecific antibodies.\nNone\n\nConflict of Interest.

The syndrome is due to a complex interaction between genetic factors, poor dietary habits and physical inactivity[12]. Population studies reported by the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) have shown that the MS, as defined by the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), has a prevalence of 39% among the US adult population[3]. The estimated prevalence of MS in the Brazilian population is 29.8% (CI95 = 28-32%) and prevalence increased from the youngest (26-34 y) to the oldest (55-64 y) group (15.8% and 48.3%, respectively)[4]. There are scientific evidences showing that some lifestyle behaviors are associated to the risk of having the MS: lack of physical activity, smoking and poor dietary habits, involving particularly excessive intake of carbohydrates and lipids[5]. High carbohydrate ingestion has been correlated with low levels of HDL cholesterol and increased concentration of triglycerides, whereas increased intake of saturated fat associates with hyperinsulinemia[6]. Nevertheless, the precise role of dietary habits in the etiology of the MS is still poorly understood. Investigations have been restricted to a few observational studies in adults, not particularly in the elderly population[78]. The present study investigated the influence of nutritional components on the prevalence of MS in a population of elderly women, in the city of Passo Fundo, Brazil.The aim was to contribute for the establishment of the role of dietary habits in the risk for the metabolic syndrome among the elderly.\nPatients and Methods\nThe population studied was composed of 284 elderly women, aging 60 years or over, socially active and participating of a third age group for recreational activities (Divis&#227;o de Apoio ao Idoso) supported by the city hall of Passo Fundo, South Brazil. At the time of this study, there were 1204 participants and the elders were invited to take part of the study.This study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, and all participants signed an informed consent form.\nNone\n\nNutritional Evaluation\nDietary habits were recorded through a quantitative questionnaire for 24-hour dietary recall[9]. All questionnaires were recorded by trained dieticians. Besides recording the food ingested during the day, information was collected on the specific characteristics of each meal, such as the way they were prepared and stuffed, use of sugar or sweetener. To reduce the possibility of errors in the research, particularly relating to the representativeness of the dietary habits recorded, soon after the interview the participants were asked if the reported food ingestion represented a usual pattern. In cases in that answers did not match, the participant was asked to provide another dietary recall, so that the usual dietary ingestion could be recorded. Nutritional calculations were performed with the DietWim Professional software version 2.0&#174; (Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil). Nutritional variables selected for this study included total calories, carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, zinc and vitamins (A, D, E, C, B6, B9 and B12).All other information was collected through a structured interview. The educational level was classified in three categories (8 years of formal study). Physical activity was categorized according to type, duration and periodicity, into four groups (4x/week). According to smoking habits, the participants were classified as smokers, ex-smokers (if quitting smoke for more than two years) and non-smokers.\nAnthropometrical Data\nFor measurement of weight (kg) and height (m), performed in an electronic anthropometric scale validated with a fixed stadiometer, individuals were barefoot and wearing light clothes. Waist circumference was measured midway between the iliac crest and the lower rib, with relaxed breathing, at approximately 0.1 cm above the umbilicus. Body mass index (BMI) was determined by weight divided by the square height. Blood pressure was measured with an aneroid sphygmomanometer, validated by an institution affiliated to Inmetro (the Brazilian regulatory agency). The mean of two measurements was used to express the systolic and diastolic blood pressures. Hypertension was defined as systolic pressure &#8805; 140 mmHg and/or diastolic pressure &#8805; 90 mmHg, or by the use of antihypertensive medications.\nBiochemical Analyses\nPeripheral blood was collected from the participants after at least a 12-hour fast. Analyses were done through enzymatic colorimetric method with commercial kits for total cholesterol (Cod- Ana Labtest&#174;), HDL cholesterol (precipitating HDL-C, Labtest&#174;), triglycerides (TG) (Gpo-Ana) and glucose (PAP Labtest&#174;). LDL cholesterol was calculated with the Friedewald equation in individual with TG levels < 400 mg/dL, (LDL-C = (TG) - Total cholesterol&#8211; HDL-C - TG/5).\nDiagnostics of the Metabolic Syndrome\nThe metabolic syndrome was defined according to criteria proposed by the International Diabetes Federation (IDF)[10], which include altered abdominal circumference and two or more of the following components: plasma lipid levels &#8805; 100 mg/dl; systolic blood pressure &#8805; 130 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure &#8805; 85 mmHg (or the use of antihypertensive medication); HDL cholesterol < 50 mg/dL for women; triglycerides &#8805; 150 mg/dL. Since the population analyzed had European origin, the cutoff for waist circumference used in this study was &#8805; 80 cm.\nStatistical Analysis\nQuantitative data are presented as mean and standard deviation, and categorical data, as frequency and percentages. The chi-squared test and variance analysis (ANOVA) were used for comparison between the MS and without MS groups. The groups with or without metabolic syndrome were compared for macro- and micronutrients intake, with adjustment of all nutrient values by total energy intake using the residue method. This method also allows the establishment of a regression equation between nutrient intake (as dependent variable) and total caloric intake (as independent variable). The presence of MS considering the quartile of nutrients was evaluated by the multiple logistic regression model with ORs adjusted for age, smoking, physical activity, educational level, total energy intake and fiber contents of the diet. The significance level was &#945;=0.05 for a two-tailed test. Data were analyzed with the SPSS software version 11.5 (SPSS Chicago, IL).\nResults\nThe sample included 284 women. According to the IDF definition[10] 91 (32% of the women) presented MS and 193 (68%) did not. Mean age was 69.3 &#177; 6.3 years, without differences between the two groups. Women with the MS presented anthropometric measurements such as abdominal circumference and BMI higher than those without the MS (p<0.005 and p<0.04, respectively). Biochemical analyses of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol and glucose also had less favorable results among women with the MS. No differences were observed for the remaining characteristics. (Table 1).Total energy intake and intake of all macronutrients and several micronutrients, adjusted or not adjusted for total energy intake, were not significantly different among elderly women with or without the metabolic syndrome (Tables 2 and 3).The risk for the metabolic syndrome was not statistically different in relation to quartiles of intake of all macronutrients and several diet micronutrients adjusted for total energy intake, age, smoking, educational level, physical activity and fibers in the diet (Tables 4 and 5).\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we evaluated the relationship between dietary components and the metabolic syndrome in the elder women and found no associations between the syndrome and intake of all macronutrients and several micronutrients.The prevalence of the MS defined according to IDF criteria[10] in the sample of 284 elderly women with mean age of 68.9 years was 32%, similar to results in industrialized countries such as the USA (22.8% to 39.0%)[311].The etiology of the MS is still poorly understood, but it seems to be due to a complex interaction among genetic and environmental factors, which include dietary habits[12]. Recent studies have shown that increased total carbohydrate intake may result in altered levels of plasma lipids, lipoprotein concentration and glucose metabolism, leading to the establishment of the MS in some individuals[12]. Although dietary factors are associated to individual components of the MS, such as diabetes mellitus type 2, blood hypertension, dyslipidemia and obesity[13], their role in the etiopathogeny of the combination of these components - the metabolic syndrome - is not well known[14]. Some studies have investigated this question in adult populations, observing some associations between dietary components and the MS[1516]. No association was observed between total carbohydrate intake and fiber contents of the diet and the MS. Similar results were reported by MC Keown[14], who however observed a relationship between the intake of integral grains and a low prevalence of the MS. Since the present study investigated the association between the MS and nutrients, but not specific types of meals, we could not corroborate those findings.Interestingly, individuals with or without the metabolic syndrome presented similar intake of carbohydrate, which was higher than the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDIs)[17], suggesting some type of gene-nutrition interaction. Concerning lipids, some studies have shown an association between the intake of linoleic acid and reduced risk for the MS[1819]. A similar association was reported by Freire and colleagues[16], who also suggested that total dietary fat may increase the risk for the MS. In humans, a detrimental role for saturated fat and a beneficial effect of polyunsaturated fats are still under debate[20]. The present study did not find any association; both groups presented similar levels of intake of total lipids and linoleic acid, which was in agreement with nutritional recommendations.In this study, the intake of antioxidant vitamins (A, E, C) by individuals with or without the MS was also investigated. Epidemiological evidences show that antioxidants have a protective role in the physiopathology of several diseases[21]. Ford et al (2003)[22] examined the plasma concentration of antioxidants and their dietary ingestion. The results showed an association between the presence of MS and a low plasma concentration of antioxidants, but not with the intake of vitamins C, E and A. The results of this study corroborate these findings, since no relationship was observed between the MS and ingestion of vitamins C, E and A. The plasma concentration of these vitamins was not analyzed.Some studies have shown an inverse association between the serum concentration of vitamin D and the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome[2324]. Low serum concentrations of vitamin D are associated to dysfunction ofpancreas cells and deficient secretion and activity of insulin[24]. In a study with 126 individuals, those with hypovitaminosis D presented a 3-fold higher probability to have MS than individuals with normal concentrations of vitamin D[23]. In another study, by Liu et al (2005)[25], no significant associations were seen between the intake of vitamin D and the prevalence of MS, but a relationship between the ingestion of calcium and milk products and low prevalence of the MS was observed. The present study did not observe associations between the ingestion of calcium and vitamin D and the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome.Several studies have shown a positive effect of magnesium in several mechanisms involved with the lipidic metabolism, such as glucose intolerance and insulin homeostasis[2627]. Song et al (2005) showed an inverse association between the intake of magnesium and prevalence of the MS[28]. The results of this study did not show a significant relationship between magnesium ingestion and the MS.According to most literature reports, the prevalence of MS is not associated with macronutrients and micronutrients present in the diet, but with the type of food ingested[781629].The results of the present study did not disagree with other studies evaluating the relationship between dietary components and the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome among younger adults[71929]. The absence of a relationship between dietary components and the MS in older individuals, shown by these results, may be due to particular characteristics of this age group, which had not been previously investigated. It is possible that the nutritional factors associated to MS have an influence in younger ages (even since intrauterine life, as suggested by some studies), but not in more advanced age as in older individuals. As suggested by Barker et al (1989)[30], environmental factors and particularly nutrition may exert their effects in earlier phases of the development, when they become associated to risks for early onset of cardiovascular disease and metabolic alterations, or premature death (young adults). According to this hypothesis, alterations in nutrition and in the endocrine situation during fetal life result in developmental adaptations which permanently modify structure, physiology and metabolism later in life.It is also possible that the lack of association between nutritional factors and the MS, observed in the present study, is due to a modification induced in the dietary habits of the participants by previous medical recommendation, motivated by the risk of diseases such as the MS, but which have not been able to prevent the establishment of the syndrome. The method used in this work to analyze dietary habits, the 24-hour dietary recall, may be a limiting factor for not representing the global diet of the participants.\nConclusion\nThe results of this study suggest that dietary factors do not have an important influence on the risk for the metabolic syndrome in elderly women, and that the condition is due to more a complex interaction of other factors such as lifestyle, genetic susceptibility and metabolism. Multidimensional, longitudinal prospective studies involving groups in different ages, and with the investigation of several aspects such as nutritional habits, lifestyle, genetic factors and metabolism, are necessary for a better understanding of the etiology of the metabolic syndrome.", "pmid": "22624137", "title": "Dietary intake is not associated to the metabolic syndrome in elderly women", "journal_title": "North American Journal of Medical Sciences", "authors": "Neide Maria Bruscato;Jos\u00e9 Luiz da Costa Vieira;Nair M\u00f4nica Ribascik do Nascimento;Marg\u00f4 Etiene Pazatto Canto;J\u00falio C\u00e9sar Stobbe;Maria Gabriela Gottlieb;M\u00e1rio Benardo Wagner;Roberta Rigo Dalacorte", "doi": "10.4297/najms.2010.2182", "score": "0.014351838"}, {"keywords": "radiation belt;dropout;geomagnetic storms;magnetopause loss;ring current;radial transport", "abstract": "Abstract\nThe outer radiation belt consists of relativistic (>0.5&#8201;MeV) electrons trapped on closed trajectories around Earth where the magnetic field is nearly dipolar. During increased geomagnetic activity, electron intensities in the belt can vary by orders of magnitude at different spatial and temporal scales. The main phase of geomagnetic storms often produces deep depletions of electron intensities over broad regions of the outer belt. Previous studies identified three possible processes that can contribute to the main&#8208;phase depletions: adiabatic inflation of electron drift orbits caused by the ring current growth, electron loss into the atmosphere, and electron escape through the magnetopause boundary. In this paper we investigate the relative importance of the adiabatic effect and magnetopause loss to the rapid depletion of the outer belt observed at the Van Allen Probes spacecraft during the main phase of 17 March 2013 storm. The intensities of >1&#8201;MeV electrons were depleted by more than an order of magnitude over the entire radial extent of the belt in less than 6&#8201;h after the sudden storm commencement. For the analysis we used three&#8208;dimensional test particle simulations of global evolution of the outer belt in the Tsyganenko&#8208;Sitnov (TS07D) magnetic field model with an inductive electric field. Comparison of the simulation results with electron measurements from the Magnetic Electron Ion Spectrometer experiment shows that magnetopause loss accounts for most of the observed depletion at L>5, while at lower L shells the depletion is adiabatic. Both magnetopause loss and the adiabatic effect are controlled by the change in global configuration of the magnetic field due to storm time development of the ring current; a simulation of electron evolution without a ring current produces a much weaker depletion.", "body": "Introduction\nThe outer radiation belt is populated by relativistic (&#8819;0.5&#8201;MeV) electrons trapped on closed trajectories around Earth where the planetary magnetic field is nearly dipolar. During geomagnetic storms electron intensities in the belt can vary by orders of magnitude on time scales from minutes to days. Storm main phase produces depletions of intensities by often more than an order of magnitude that can extend over broad regions of the belt. The intensities generally increase during storm recovery phase. Poststorm intensity levels, however, have no apparent relation to their values prior to the storm: storms can dramatically increase, decrease, or produce no substantial change in electron intensities in the belt [Reeves et al., 2003]. This inconsistency in the response of relativistic electron intensities to geomagnetic storms is one of the long&#8208;standing mysteries of radiation belt physics.It has long been recognized that both permanent loss processes and fully adiabatic variations of electron intensities can contribute to radiation belt depletions during storm main phase (see review by Millan and Thorne [2007]). Electrons can be permanently lost from the belt either by means of precipitation into the atmosphere or escape through the magnetopause boundary [e.g., Dungey, 1963; Roederer, 1968]. Adiabatic depletions of electron intensities (henceforth &#8220;the adiabatic effect&#8221;) can be caused by a slow inflation of electron drift orbits in response to the diamagnetic effect produced by the storm time ring current system [e.g., Dessler and Karplus, 1960, 1961; McIlwain, 1966]. For radiation belt intensities to grow in the recovery phase, permanent losses must be replenished by transport of new electrons into the outer belt and their acceleration to relativistic energies. On the other hand, a decrease of intensities associated with the adiabatic effect is fully reversible; the intensities grow back by the same amount after the ring current decay, without any additional transport or acceleration processes. Quantifying the contribution of the adiabatic effect to main&#8208;phase depletion events is, therefore, essential to understanding the relationship between the prestorm and poststorm intensities of the outer belt.A variety of plasma waves can resonantly interact with the gyromotion of relativistic electrons leading to electron scattering into the drift and bounce loss cones and subsequent precipitation into the atmosphere (see review by Thorne [2010]). Potentially relevant wave modes include electromagnetic ion cyclotron, whistler chorus, and magnetosonic waves which draw their energy from energetic plasma populations produced during the storm main phase. Consequently, wave occurrence and the expected atmospheric loss rates are higher during storms [e.g., Li et al., 2011; Keika et al., 2013; Ma et al., 2013]. Similarly, a number of main&#8208;phase processes such as nonadiabatic drift orbit expansion due to rapidly growing ring current [Ukhorskiy et al., 2006a] and enhanced outward radial transport due to sharp gradients at the boundary and intensified ULF wave activity [e.g., Shprits et al., 2006; Ukhorskiy et al., 2009] can increase electron loss through the magnetopause.The relative contributions of the adiabatic effect and electron loss into the atmosphere and through the magnetopause to the main&#8208;phase depletion of radiation belt intensities have been a subject of ongoing debate. From the analysis of the 3 November 1993 magnetic storm (min D\ns\nt=&#8722;120&#8201;nT), Li et al. [1997] concluded that the adiabatic effect alone cannot account for the observed depletion of electron intensities at L>4 and that the presence of either atmospheric precipitation or magnetopause loss is required. Green et al. [2004] used >2 MeV electron measurements at geosynchronous orbit in a superposed epoch analysis of the main&#8208;phase depletions in 52 moderate storms (min D\ns\nt>&#8722;60&#8201;nT). The study concluded that the nonadiabatic portion of the observed depletions is caused by atmospheric precipitation rather than magnetopause loss. Ohtani et al. [2009] conducted a statistical analysis of >2&#8201;MeV electron measurements at geosynchronous orbit from 1998 to 2005. They found that irrespective of storm activity, the day&#8208;night asymmetry of the magnetic field is enhanced during the majority of depletion events, leaving electrons on open drift paths intersecting the magnetopause. This study suggests that radiation belt depletions are mainly controlled by magnetopause loss. Yuan and Zong [2013] arrived to a similar conclusion with the superposed epoch analysis of electron intensities measured by Solar Anomalous and Magnetospheric Particle Explorer during 110 coronal mass ejection (CME)&#8208;driven geomagnetic storms.The analysis of a large geomagnetic storm (min D\ns\nt=&#8722;427&#8201;nT) of 20 November 2003 [Bortnik et al., 2006] suggested that the outer belt depletion at L>5 is attributed to magnetopause loss, while at lower L shells, the depletion is caused by atmospheric precipitation. Ukhorskiy et al. [2006a] conducted two&#8208;dimensional test particle simulations of the evolution of the outer belt intensity during a more moderate (min D\ns\nt=&#8722;160&#8201;nT) storm of 7 September 2002. Despite the difference in magnitude of the storm compared to [Bortnik et al., 2006], it was also found that magnetopause loss was active above L=5. All electrons at L>5 were lost from the belt in less than 2.5&#8201;h after the storm onset. The losses were primarily attributed to a nonadiabatic drift orbit expansion caused by the diamagnetic effect of the storm time ring current.\nTurner et al. [2012] used multiple equatorial and low&#8208;altitude spacecraft to analyze the evolution of the outer belt intensity during the main phase of a moderate storm (min D\ns\nt=&#8722;50 nT). The study provides strong observational evidence that the deep depletion of intensities observed down to L=4 were caused by electron loss through the magnetopause. Recently, Turner et al. [2014] considered a radiation belt depletion during a larger storm (min D\ns\nt=&#8722;135 nT) on 30 September 2012, with the use of multiple equatorial spacecraft. This study concludes that the depletion of electron intensities observed at L\n*>4 is consistent with magnetopause loss, while an additional loss mechanism is required to explain the depletion observed at L\n*<4. Hudson et al. [2014] conducted a global test particle simulation of the 8 October 2012 storm (min D\ns\nt=&#8722;106 nT) with the use of the coupled Lyon&#8208;Fedder&#8208;Mobarry Rice Convection Model magnetospheric model, which showed strong magnetopause loss down to about L=7. It was concluded that the observed depletion of electron intensities down to L=3 involves additional loss mechanisms not accounted for by the model.In this paper we analyze the main phase of the 17 March 2013 magnetic storm that produced a deep depletion of electron intensities across the entire radial extent of the outer belt. We conduct global simulations of storm time evolution of radiation belt intensities and then compare the simulation results with electron intensities observed by the Magnetic Electron Ion Spectrometer (MagEIS) experiment [Blake et al., 2013] of the Van Allen Probes mission [Mauk et al., 2012].Our model computes three&#8208;dimensional motion of relativistic electrons and is therefore not constrained by unphysical limitations of previous two&#8208;dimensional simulations of the equatorially mirroring particles [e.g., Ukhorskiy et al., 2006a]. In two&#8208;dimensional models, radiation belt electrons in steady state drift along B = const contours of the equatorial plane. If the drift contour intersects the magnetopause, the electrons are lost from the belt. In three dimensions, electrons bouncing at the magnetic equator on the nightside can exhibit drift orbit bifurcations on the dayside, where the magnetic field is compressed, and then traverse across the dayside magnetosphere off the equatorial plane along the magnetopause boundary without ever crossing it [e.g., Ukhorskiy et al., 2011]. On the other hand, electron orbits in the bifurcation region are not stable. Bifurcations violate the second adiabatic invariant of the electron drift&#8208;bounce motion, leading to fast radial transport across the bifurcation region [Ukhorskiy et al., 2014] and can therefore provide a mechanism for electron escape from the region of stable outer belt orbits to the magnetopause.The goal of this paper is to investigate the role of the adiabatic effect and magnetopause loss in the observed rapid depletion of relativistic electron intensities. To simulate electron motion, we used the (TS07D) magnetic field model [Tsyganenko and Sitnov, 2007] with an inductive electric field [Ukhorskiy et al., 2014]. The TS07D model was selected for this analysis for the following two reasons. First, the model provides a realistic specification of storm time currents that determine the distribution of magnetic field across the inner magnetosphere [Sitnov et al., 2008, 2010] and accurate location of the magnetopause boundary [Shue et al., 1998], which are important for quantifying both the adiabatic effect and magnetopause loss. Second, the state of the TS07D model is defined by a set of solar wind and geomagnetic input parameters. Individual input parameters can be adjusted independently, which can be used to analyze how the depletion of radiation belt intensities depends on various solar wind and geomagnetic conditions.One possible interpretation of the discrepancy among previous results is that there is little correlation between the magnitude of the storm time ring current system (measured by min D\ns\nt) and the balance between atmospheric and magnetopause losses. Since the SYM&#8208;H index (1&#8201;min analog of D\ns\nt) and its time derivative are among the main input parameters of TS07D, we can directly address the role of the storm time ring current in radiation belt depletions by adjusting model input parameters throughout storm main phase.The following section gives an overview of the radiation belt depletion event during the main phase of 17 March 2013 storm. In section&#8201;3, we discuss the details of our test particle model. In sections&#8201;4 and 5, followed by conclusions, we present simulation results and discuss the comparison with observations.\nThe 17 March 2003 Depletion Event\nThe Van Allen Probes Mission comprises two spacecraft (A and B) on nearly identical low inclination (10&#176;) orbits with perigee of &#8764;600&#8201;km, apogee of 5.8R\nE, and orbital period of approximately 9&#8201;h [Mauk et al., 2012]. Figure&#8201;1 shows variability of radiation belt intensities observed by Van Allen Probes over March 2013 when the spacecraft apogees were in the postmidnight sector. Figures&#8201;1c and 1d show the observation at Probe A of the omnidirectional intensity of 1.25&#8201;MeV electrons measured by the MagEIS instrument [Blake et al., 2013] and the intensity of 5.6&#8201;MeV electrons measured by Relativistic Electron&#8208;Proton Telescope (REPT) [Baker et al., 2013]. Figures&#8201;1a and 1b display the time series of the solar wind dynamic pressure P\ndyn and the D\ns\nt index.The storm of 17 March began with a sudden commencement at approximately 06:00&#8201;UT with a rapid increase of P\ndyn from about 1&#8201;nPa to over 20&#8201;nPa, triggered by the arrival of an interplanetary shock at the front end of a coronal mass ejection, followed by the southward turning of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) (not shown). The main phase continued until approximately 18:00&#8201;UT when the IMF turned northward, starting the recovery phase. During the main phase, the D\ns\nt index dropped down to approximately &#8722;120&#8201;nT.The storm main phase depleted the intensities of &#8819; 1&#8211;6&#8201;MeV electrons by more than an order of magnitude over the entire radial extent of the outer belt. The intensities of lower energy electrons (not shown) increased due to direct injections of particles from the magnetotail to deep inside the outer belt. Figure&#8201;1e shows the intensity of 1.25&#8201;MeV electrons measured by MagEIS on Probes A and B over a 48&#8201;h interval centered at the depletion event. As can be seen from the figure, the depletion of electron intensity occurred in less than 6&#8201;h after the storm sudden commencement. The intensities recovered to their prestorm values by the end of the main phase, exceeding the prestorm values by more than an order of magnitude in less than 7&#8201;h after beginning of the recovery phase (for more details see Figure S1 in the supporting information). Quantifying the processes that produced the depletion of radiation belt intensities in the beginning of the storm is necessary for understanding whether their rapid growth in the recovery phase was caused by the adiabatic effect or transport and acceleration of a fresh electron population.\nTest Particle Model\nTo simulate the global evolution of radiation belt intensities during storm main phase, we used a test particle approach. First, dynamics of a large number of test particles were computed in the magnetic and electric fields precalculated for the entire simulation interval. Then, the computed phase space trajectories were used to trace the electron phase space density in time from the simulation start. The initial distribution of the electron phase space density was derived from the MagEIS measurements.Test particle trajectories were computed in storm time magnetic and inductive electric fields. The potential electric field due to global magnetospheric convection [e.g., Weimer, 2001] does not significantly affect relativistic electron motion [e.g., Ukhorskiy et al., 2006a] and therefore was neglected. The fields were calculated with the use of an empirical model, TS07D, which provides an accurate specification of the magnetic field in the inner magnetosphere during storms [Sitnov et al., 2008, 2010].The TS07D model employs a flexible basis function representation of storm time equatorial currents free of any a priori assumptions of current location or morphology typical for earlier versions of the model. To reconstruct a global distribution of the geomagnetic field at a given moment of time, the model uses a large database of in situ measurements of the magnetic field from historic and current spacecraft missions that provide comprehensive coverage of the inner magnetosphere and the magnetotail at various solar wind and geomagnetic conditions. At a given moment of time, the model coefficients are computed from a subset of the whole database (nearest neighbors) selected to represent similar solar wind and geomagnetic conditions. The nearest neighbors are defined based on three global input parameters &#12296;v\nB\nS&#12297;, &#12296;S\nY\nM&#8208;H&#12297;, and D&#12296;S\nY\nM&#8208;H&#12297;/D\nt, derived from the time series of the solar wind electric field and the SYM&#8208;H index using 6&#8201;h cosine and sine masked averaging in the spirit of principle component analysis of nonlinear time series [Broomhead and King, 1986]. The averaging includes 3&#8201;h of the input time series prior to the current state and extends by 3&#8201;h into the future. The first two input parameters have the physical meaning of time&#8208;averaged quantities, while the third parameters corresponds to the average time derivative centered on the current state (for more details, see Sitnov et al. [2008, 2010]).In addition to average solar wind and geomagnetic input parameters, the model state is defined by the instantaneous value of the solar wind dynamic pressure, P\ndyn, that scales all model current systems. Time dependence in the model comes through the input parameters. Variation of the input parameters changes the distribution of magnetic field coherently over the entire model domain. The model therefore does not account for any effects of plasma waves and is therefore only applicable on time scales longer than the transit time of 1&#8211;3&#8201;min, i.e., the time it takes for a magnetosonic wave to propagate from the magnetopause though the inner magnetosphere [Ukhorskiy et al., 2006a, 2006b; Ukhorskiy and Sitnov, 2008; Ukhorskiy et al., 2014].The magnetic field was specified on a Cartesian grid in GSM coordinates with dx=dy=dz=0.2R\nE. To simplify the analysis of simulation results, the dipole tilt angle was set to zero. For zero tilt angle, the GSM and the SM coordinates are equivalent, and the magnetic equator is a plane given by z=0.The inductive electric field induced by variations in the global state of the model was calculated from the time derivative of the magnetic field vector potential: A=&#945;&#8711;&#946;. The values of Euler potentials &#945; and &#946; were calculated numerically by tracing magnetic field lines from the grid points to Earth's surface, where the potential values were determined from the analytical expressions for a dipolar magnetic field [Ukhorskiy et al., 2014]. This approach for determining inductive electric field from empirical magnetic field models has been used in a number of past studies including a computation of the electric field during storm main phase [Ukhorskiy et al., 2006a] and analysis of the electric fields induced by ULF fluctuations in the solar wind dynamic pressure [Ukhorskiy et al., 2006a, 2006b; Ukhorskiy and Sitnov, 2008; Ukhorskiy et al., 2014] (for a comparison of the solar wind pressure&#8208;induced electric fields computed from the TS07D and a global MHD model [Claudepierre et al., 2010] see Figure S2 in the supporting information).The electron motion was calculated in the guiding center approximation based on our Hamiltonian formulation [Ukhorskiy et al., 2011, 2014]. Five&#8208;dimensional phase space of the guiding center motion is specified by (r,&#947;,&#945;), where r is the particle location, &#947; is the relativistic factor, and &#945; is the pitch angle. In this paper we focus on the evolution of 1.25&#8201;MeV electrons, i.e., the lowest MagEIS energy channel that shows the depletion of electron intensities unattenuated by direct injections. To avoid introducing an unphysical bias into the electron distribution function, test particles must initially be evenly distributed over the phase space domain around 1.25 MeV. The energy range of test particles must be sufficiently broad to capture adiabatic effects, i.e., it must include sufficiently low/high energy particles that can be accelerated/decelerated to 1.25&#8201;MeV in the course of the storm main phase. The following procedure was used to initialize test particles.First, in a static magnetic field corresponding to t=0 of the simulation process, we computed a set of stable (i.e., nonbifurcating) drift&#8208;bounce trajectories using the initial conditions along the midnight meridian of the equatorial plane (y=z=0), distributed between x=&#8722;7.6 and x=&#8722;3.0. At each initial location, the trajectories were computed for equatorial pitch angles between &#945;\neq=10&#176; and &#945;\neq=90&#176; at increments of 5&#176;. The solar wind dynamic pressure before the storm was only P\ndyn=1.35&#8201;nPa. The earthward boundary of the drift orbit bifurcation region at such low value of the dynamic pressure was as far as x=&#8722;6.9, i.e., at x>&#8722;6.9, drift&#8208;bounce orbits were stable at all pitch angles. At x=&#8722;7.6 the orbits were stable only for &#945;\neq<30&#176;. The data points of all stable drift&#8208;bounce trajectories with common value of &#945;\neq were then combined into 17 different sets.Second, we introduced a 21&#215;40 polar grid in the equatorial plane, (L,&#981;), between L=3 and L=7.2 and chose 100 values of initial particle energy distributed evenly between &#947;=2.5 (0.77&#8201;MeV) and &#947;=6 (2.8&#8201;MeV). For each energy value, we used the points of stable drift&#8208;bounce trajectories calculated in the previous step to randomly select one point per grid cell of the equatorial polar grid from each of the 17 sets corresponding to different equatorial pitch angle values. This gave us 21 &#215; 40 &#215; 17 &#215; 100 = 1,428,000 initial conditions evenly distributed in L, the azimuthal drift angle &#981;, the bounce phase, equatorial pitch angle (at the midnight meridian), and energy.The initial distribution of electron phase space density was computed from the radial profiles and pitch angle distributions of electron intensities measured by MagEIS on the inbound pass of Probe A prior to the storm (02:24&#8211;06:00&#8201;UT). Figure&#8201;2 shows the radial profiles of &#947;=2&#8211;6 electron intensities at nearly 90&#176; pitch angle (Figure&#8201;2a) along with the derived distribution of their phase space density, f(L,&#947;) (Figure&#8201;2b). We used sinn\n&#945; fits to approximate the pitch angle distributions. According to the MagEIS measurements (not shown), n varied monotonically between n=1 at L=3.5 and n=0 at L=6. It was assumed that for quiet conditions prior to the storm, the phase space density was independent of the azimuthal drift angle. Since the spacecraft apogee on 17 March 2013 was close to midnight, the L values of the MagEIS measurements approximately correspond to the midnight meridian: L\nM=L(x<0,y=0). We also assumed that being at low latitude, MagEIS captures equatorial pitch angle distributions. Therefore, the phase space density of the outer electron belt prior to the storm was approximated as\n(1)f(LM,&#947;)sinn(LM)&#945;eq.\nThe initial distribution (1) was used to assign weights to the test particles based on their initial location in phase space. We set up a regular grid in the guiding center phase space on the hyperplane corresponding to the magnetic equator z = 0: {X\nk}&#8801;{L\ni, &#981;j,&#945;eql, &#947;\nm}. Test particles initially located in a kth cell of the grid (i.e., {X\ni(t = 0)|X\ni&#8712;[X\nk,X\nk+&#948;\nX)}) were assigned weights equal to the ratio of the number of &#8220;physical&#8221; particles in this grid cell, computed with the use of the phase space density value in the cell center, to the number N\ni of test particles in this cell:\n(2)wi=1Nif(&#12296;LM&#12297;,&#947;m)sinn(&#12296;LM&#12297;)&#945;eql&#183;&#948;&#915;(Xk),\nwhere &#12296;L\nM&#12297; is the average value of the test particle location in L\nM and &#948;\n&#915;(X\nk) is the volume of the phase space grid cell. The value of the phase space density in a kth grid cell at time t > 0 of the simulation process is then computed by dividing the sum of the weights of all N\nk test particles currently located in that cell by the cell volume:\n(3)f(t,Xk)=1&#948;&#915;(Xk)&#8721;j=1Nkwj;where{Xj(t)|Xj&#8712;[Xk,Xk+&#948;X)}.\nThe value of the phase space density in a given cell can be changed in two ways: by changing the number of test particles in the cell, e.g., by particle escape through the magnetopause boundary, and by particle transport that changes the average value of test particle weights in the cell, e.g., an interchange of equal number of particles between two cells with lower and higher values of the phase space density (Figure&#8201;3). By tracking the evolution of the number of particles and their average weights, one can determine what processes control the evolution of electron intensities in the belt. A decrease of the number of particles with fixed values of the initial energy and pitch angle everywhere in the computation domain indicates permanent loss of particles from this region of phase space either through the magnetopause boundary or by precipitation into the atmosphere. On the other hand, a change in the average weights of test particles at given values of energy and pitch angle, without a substantial variation in their number, implies that the phase space density is changed by particle redistribution over the phase space.To determine whether the dynamics underlying the permanent loss of particles, as well as redistribution over phase space, are produced by fully adiabatic effects or transport across their drift shells, it is necessary to quantify radial transport rates. During elevated levels of the solar wind dynamic pressure, a large portion of the outer belt orbits undergo drift orbit bifurcations. Since the bifurcations violate the second adiabatic invariant, the third invariant and L\n*, commonly used to quantify radial transport, are not defined in the bifurcation region. To measure radial transport we use the generalized L&#175; variable computed from the time&#8208;dependent drift&#8208;bounce orbits,\n(4)&#934;&#175;=&#8747;02&#960;&#945;d&#946;=&#8722;2&#960;B0RE2L&#175;\nIt was previously shown [Ukhorskiy et al., 2014] that L&#175; provides a good measure of radial transport, i.e., (a) for stable orbits in a static field L&#175;=L*; (b) for time&#8208;varying adiabatic variations in the field (&#934; = const), L&#175;=L*; and (c) for nonadiabatic transport (&#934; &#8800; const); L&#175; is approximately the average of L\n* over a particle drift orbit.\nGlobal Simulations of Storm Time Depletion\nThe results of our test particle simulation of the first 6&#8201;h of the storm are shown in Figure&#8201;4 (also see Movie S1 in the supporting information). Figures&#8201;4a and 4b display the time series of the solar wind dynamic pressure P\ndyn and the SYM&#8208;H index used as the inputs of the TS07D model. Note that in order to avoid unrealistically large inductive electric fields due to coherent compressions of the quasi&#8208;static magnetic field model at sharp increases of P\ndyn, the input time series were parsed with a 10&#8201;min cadence. Consequently, having the Nyquist period of 20&#8201;min, the model does not resolve any fluctuations in the magnetospheric fields that could exhibit resonance with the drift motion of &#8764;1&#8211;2&#8201;MeV electrons in the bulk of the outer belt (the drift period T\nD3.3).Figure&#8201;4c shows evolution of the intensity of 1.25&#8211;1.50&#8201;MeV electrons with near&#8208;perpendicular pitch angles of 80&#8211;90&#176;, along the midnight meridian at the magnetic equator computed at 30&#8201;s cadence. The midnight projection approximately corresponds to the radial profiles of electron intensity captured at Van Allen Probes whose apogees were close to midnight. Figure&#8201;4d displays the pitch angle distribution of electron intensity at L=4.3, near the maximum of its radial distribution. The model shows strong depletion of electron intensity starting after the storm sudden commencement and continuing through the entire simulation interval. The periodic temporal modulations of the intensity seen until approximately 10:00&#8201;UT are attributed to the drift echoes associated with changes in the solar wind P\ndyn. The drift echoes exhibit T&#8764;1/L temporal dispersion in accordance with the L dependence of the electron azimuthal drift period (at a given energy). The depletion is first observed at nearly perpendicular pitch angles and then expands toward smaller pitch angle values. About 3&#8201;h into the storm main phase, the electron intensities are depleted by an order of magnitude or more at all pitch angles over the entire radial extent of the outer belt.Figures&#8201;4e&#8211;4g illustrate the processes controlling the depletion of radiation belt intensities. Figure&#8201;4e shows evolution of the number of particles that comprised the radial profile of the near&#8208;equatorial electron intensity at the simulation start. It displays the number of particles, N, currently in the grid cells along the midnight meridian of the equatorial plane whose initial energies were in the range of 1.25&#8211;1.50&#8201;MeV, and the initial pitch angles were in the range of 80&#8211;90&#176;. The number of particles found in each grid cell is normalized to the number of particles, N\n0, initialized in this cell at the simulation start. The figure shows strong electron losses that start at the outer edge of the electron belt after the storm sudden commencement and expand inward to below L=5 over the next 3&#8201;h following the increase in P\ndyn and the ring current enhancement (decrease in SYM&#8208;H). According to the model, all permanent losses were caused by particle escape through the magnetopause boundary. By the end of the simulation, no particles remain in the belt above L=5.3.Figure&#8201;4f shows average weight, &#12296;w&#12297;, of test particles in the grid cells along the midnight meridian of the equatorial plane that constitute the radial profiles of the electron intensity shown in Figure&#8201;4c. The average weight in each grid cell is normalized by the initial value, w\n0, assigned to the particles in this grid cell at the simulation start. A decrease in &#12296;w&#12297;/w\n0 starts at the storm sudden commencement and deepens with subsequent development of the ring current (decrease in SYM&#8208;H). By the end of the simulation, &#12296;w&#12297;/w\n0 is decreased by a factor of 10 or more over the entire range of the remaining outer belt. Since, according to Figure&#8201;4e, there is little or no particle loss below L=5, the depletion of the electron intensity in the remaining portion of the belt is attributed to redistribution of particles in the phase space.Figure&#8201;4g displays the difference in the average values of L&#175; of test particles in the grid cells along the midnight meridian of the equatorial plane that constitute the radial profiles of the electron intensity shown in Figure&#8201;4c and the average values of L&#175;0 these particles had at the simulation start. As can be seen from the figure, by the end of the simulation the difference &#12296;L&#175;&#12297;&#8722;&#12296;L&#175;0&#12297; is approximately zero over the entire radial extent of the remaining outer belt. Recall that L&#175;, like L\n*, is a measure of the third invariant. We therefore conclude that the depletion of the electron intensity observed at L<5 is primarily attributed to the adiabatic effect rather than particle transport across drift shells.Figure&#8201;5 shows the comparison of the simulation results with the MagEIS measurements. The radial profile of 1.25&#8211;1.50&#8201;MeV electron intensity measured on Probe A prior to the storm, which was used to initialize electron phase space density in the simulations, is shown in cyan. The intensity distribution measured by MagEIS on the outbound pass of Probe A during storm main phase (11:07&#8211;14:40&#8201;UT) is shown with yellow. The intensity was depleted by more than an order of magnitude compared to its prestorm value. The radial distribution of electron intensity computed at the end of our test particle simulations is shown with blue. From the close agreement between the observed and the simulated profiles of the electron intensity, it follows that our test particle model provides a realistic description of global evolution of radiation belt intensities during storm main phase and that the observed deep depletion of electron intensities is caused primarily by a combination of magnetopause loss at L > 5 and the adiabatic effect at L < 5.The strongest magnetopause losses and adiabatic depletions in the model were associated with increases in the solar wind dynamic pressure P\ndyn at storm sudden commencement and around 08:10&#8201;UT. Magnetopause compressions lead to earthward expansion of the drift orbit bifurcation region; an increase in P\ndyn from 2 to 9&#8201;nPa moves the boundary between the stable and bifurcating orbits on the nightside from above the geosynchronous orbit to 5.5&#8201;R\nE [Ukhorskiy and Sitnov, 2012]. Electrons transformed from stable to bifurcating orbits can be quickly lost through the magnetopause due to rapid radial transport associated with violations of the second invariant at bifurcations [Ukhorskiy et al., 2014]. Magnetopause compressions also affect the global distribution of magnetic field across the outer belt and therefore can produce adiabatic changes of electron intensities.To understand how the intensification of the storm time current system contributes to the depletion of electron intensities, we conducted the following experiment. We recalculated the magnetospheric fields varying only P\ndyn and keeping all other inputs in TS07D fixed at their quiet time prestorm values. The obtained fields still capture the effects of the magnetopause compressions but do not account for field line stretching due to the diamagnetic effect caused by storm time ring current. We then ran our test particle model using the same initial conditions for the electron phase space density as in the previous simulation. The results are summarized in Figure&#8201;6 in the form similar to Figure&#8201;4 (more details can be seen in Movie S2 in the supporting information).The comparison of corresponding panels in Figures&#8201;4 and 6 reveals that the storm time ring current dramatically affects evolution of electron intensities in response to increases in the solar wind dynamic pressure. From Figures&#8201;4c and 4d and Figures&#8201;6c and 6d it can be seen that the depletion of intensities of 1.25&#8211;1.50&#8201;MeV electrons with near&#8208;perpendicular pitch angles is much less pronounced without the ring current. There is no evident depletion of electron intensities at pitch angles of 60&#176; and less. The difference in the response of the near&#8208;equatorial electrons is elucidated by Figures&#8201;6e and 6f. According to Figures&#8201;4e and 6e, magnetopause loss is much weaker without the ring current. At the end of the simulation interval without a ring current, the outer edge of the belt was at L=5.8 and only 20% of the initial particle population was lost through the magnetopause, whereas in the simulation with the ring current the outer edge was at L=5.3 and as much as 55% of the initial particle population was lost. As can be seen from Figure&#8201;6f, increases of the solar wind dynamic pressure without a ring current cause adiabatic enhancement of the electron intensity as opposed to strong adiabatic depletions due to the ring current enhancement in Figure&#8201;4f.The radial profile of 1.25&#8211;1.50&#8201;MeV electron intensity at the end of the simulation without a ring current is shown in Figure&#8201;5 with purple color. As can be seen from the comparison with observations at MagEIS (yellow color), the model without a ring current underestimates the depletion of electron intensity by more than a factor of 10. Consequently, we conclude that the diamagnetic effect due to the ring current system is a key factor in the observed deep depletion of radiation belt intensities during storm main phase.\nTransport During Magnetopause Loss\nAccording to the results discussed in the previous section, electrons that remain in the outer belt at L<5 at the end of the simulation interval behave mostly adiabatically. It is also important to determine whether the magnetopause loss that depletes the belt above L=5 involved radial transport of electrons across their drift shells. Indeed, a number of previous studies [e.g., Kim et al., 2008; Turner et al., 2014] evaluated the extent of magnetopause loss based on the instantaneous location of the boundary between closed electron orbits and open orbits intersecting the magnetopause. If, however, the loss processes involve strong radial transport, estimates based on the location of open&#8208;closed boundary can substantially underestimate both the extent and the rates of the magnetopause loss.Two processes in the TS07D model can lead to radial transport of electrons in the outer belt: large&#8208;scale inductive electric fields and drift orbit bifurcations. Variations of the solar wind dynamic pressure along with intensification of the ring current system produce global reconfigurations of the magnetic field across the inner magnetosphere. The time&#8208;varying magnetic field induces an inductive electric field which can drive radial transport by means of the E &#215; B drift in the direction perpendicular to the electron gradient and curvature drift motion. Figure&#8201;7 shows instantaneous radial profiles (yellow symbols) of the azimuthal electric field component (responsible for drift in the radial direction) at different times of the simulation interval. Average values are shown with red symbols. According to the figure the average absolute value of the azimuthal electric field component at L>5 was above 0.2&#8201;mV/m, whereas its instantaneous values periodically exceeded 1&#8201;mV/m. Considering that an instantaneous value of the inductive electric field in the model is calculated from the change in magnetic field over a 10&#8201;min period (time cadence of the model), these large&#8208;scale inductive electric fields can provide a viable mechanism of radial transport at L>5. This point can be illustrated with a simple estimate of radial transport of equatorially mirroring particles in a dipole magnetic field. The radial component of E &#215; B drift in this case is given by\n(5)ur(RE/min)=cE&#981;L3B060RE&#8771;3&#183;10&#8722;4E&#981;(mV/m)L3,\nwhere c is the speed of light and B\n0 is the magnetic field intensity on Earth's surface at the equator. Taking the average value of E\n&#981;=0.2mV/m at L=5 and integrating over 10&#8201;min, we obtain a change in the radial position of &#916;\nL&#8771;7.5&#183;10&#8722;2, which corresponds to a relative change in radial position of 1.5% over 10&#8201;min.As was previously discussed, transition of electrons with large pitch angles from the region of stable closed orbits to the magnetopause boundary generally involves drift orbit bifurcations. Bifurcations break the second adiabatic invariant associated with the electron bounce motion, leading to their scattering in the radial direction. The rates of the bifurcation&#8208;driven transport can exceed the rates of radial transport due to ULF waves by an order of magnitude [Ukhorskiy et al., 2014]. The total radial distance meandered by electrons across their drift shells depends on the number of bifurcations they underwent during the transition from the stable region to the magnetopause.To quantify radial transport in the simulations, we use the cumulative distance traveled by particles in the L&#175; space:\n(6)&#916;L&#175;(T)=&#8721;t=1Nt(L&#175;t&#8722;L&#175;t&#8722;1)2,T=Nt&#948;t,\nwhere &#948;\nt is the time step of test particle simulations. Figure&#8201;8 shows the transport of &#8764;2&#183;103 particles that were lost from the belt in approximately 1.5&#8201;h after the simulation start. Black lines show trajectories of individual particles, and the red symbols show their average. Figure&#8201;8a shows the solar wind dynamic pressure, P\ndyn. As can be seen from the correlation of P\ndyn and the average transport curve, two increases in P\ndyn at storm sudden commencement, around T=0.5h and around T=1.2h, lead to increases in radial transport rates. The points of drift orbit bifurcations are marked with yellow symbols. We calculated that the jumps in L&#175; at orbit bifurcations account for approximately 60% of the cumulative transport. The remaining 40% can then be attributed to large&#8208;scale inductive electric fields.Between the time of the storm sudden commencement and particle loss through the magnetopause, the average transport rate was &#916;L&#175;&#8771;0.&#8201;h&#8722;1. To put this result in a context, we compared it with the radial diffusion rates (DLLE) derived by Brautigam and Albert [2000] (see Figure&#8201;4 of their paper). We found that the average transport rates of radiation belt electrons prior to magnetopause loss in our model exceeded the fastest radial diffusion rates at highly disturbed geomagnetic conditions (K\np=6).\nConclusions\nIn this study we analyzed a strong depletion of radiation belt intensities during the 17 March 2013 geomagnetic storm. During the main phase of the storm, the intensities of the preexisting &#8764;1&#8211;6&#8201;MeV electron population were depleted by more than an order of magnitude over the entire radial extent of the outer belt. The analysis was based on global three&#8208;dimensional test particle simulations of global evolution of the outer electron belt based on the TS07D storm time magnetic field model with the inductive electric field. Simulation results were then compared with relativistic electron measurements by the MagEIS instrument of the Van Allen Probes Mission. The following are our conclusions: \nThe observed depletion was produced by a combination of the permanent loss of relativistic electrons through the magnetopause boundary at L>5 and the adiabatic effect at L<5. As much as 55% of the prestorm electron population was lost from the belt through the magnetopause in less than 6&#8201;h after the storm sudden commencement. No particles remained in the outer belt above L=5.3. The adiabatic effect was attributed to development of the storm time ring current. Simulation without a ring current exhibited an inverse effect: adiabatic heating of particles at L<5 produced by strong magnetopause compressions at increases in the solar wind dynamic pressure. Good agreement of the simulation results and MagEIS measurements suggests that atmospheric precipitation (not observed on the model) did not substantially contribute to the decrease of radiation belt intensities during storm main phase.Magnetopause loss during storm main phase is controlled by only a couple of global processes. At storm sudden commencement, the solar wind dynamic pressure, P\ndyn, increased from about 1&#8201;nPa to over 20&#8201;nPa. Large variations in P\ndyn continued over approximately 3&#8201;h into the main phase. Magnetopause compressions lead to earthward expansion of the drift orbit bifurcation region. Consequently, electrons previously on a stably trapped orbits in the bulk of the radiation belt become unstable, bifurcations coupled with rapid radial transport lead to their loss through the magnetopause boundary. Another key factor in the magnetopause loss is the buildup of the storm time ring current. Its diamagnetic effect leads to strong stretching of the magnetic field on the nightside, pushing electron drift orbits outward and increasing the loss. Stretched magnetic configurations also inhibit inward transport of radiation belt electrons. Consequently, radial transport during magnetopause compressions is predominantly outward, leading to the magnetopause loss and depletion of radiation belt intensities.Magnetopause loss involves strong radial transport of radiation belt electrons across their drift shells. It was found that average transport rates exceeded the earlier calculations of rates of radial diffusion during highly disturbed geomagnetic conditions (K\np=6). Our model includes two sources of radial transport: drift orbit bifurcations and effect of large&#8208;scale inductive electric fields induced by global variations of the magnetic field. It was found that drift orbit bifurcations accounted for approximately 60% of the transport, while the remaining 40% were attributed to the inductive electric fields.\nIt is important to note that global evolution of the magnetic and electric fields in the TS07D model which determines storm time dynamics of the outer radiation belt is mainly controlled by two parameters: the solar wind dynamic pressure P\ndyn and the SYM&#8208;H index. It can therefore be expected that the conclusions of this paper, based on the simulation of one storm on 17 March 2013, will remain relevant to other CME&#8208;driven storms with similar time history of P\ndyn and SYM&#8208;H. We can expect that the main phases of all similar storms would produce strong depletions of radiation belt intensities attributed to permanent electron loss from a large portion of the outer L shells, dominated by electron escape through the magnetopause boundary, and the adiabatic effect at the lower L shells.The fact that the main&#8208;phase depletion of electron intensities at L>5 are irreversible has an important implication: no correlation should be expected between the prestorm and after&#8208;storm intensities in this portion of the outer radiation belt. Consequently, the state of the outer belt after the storm recovery is largely determined by the injections of &#8220;seed&#8221; electrons during storm main phase and the balance among their acceleration and loss mechanisms in the recovery phase.\nSupporting information\n", "pmid": "27656334", "title": "Global storm time depletion of the outer electron belt", "journal_title": "Journal of Geophysical Research.

Detecting this co-occurrence may be important for treatment planning.", "body": "Introduction\nSleep problems, which include difficulty in falling or staying asleep, early morning awakening with the non-resumption of sleep, and an inconsistent sleep/wake pattern1,2 are common in the general population. Studies from countries across the world have reported a prevalence of sleep problems ranging from 1.6% to 56.0%3&#8211;5, while other research has highlighted that sleep problems may be increasing in some countries/populations6&#8211;8. The fact that many people experience sleep problems is alarming given that they have been linked to a range of detrimental outcomes. Specifically, sleep problems have been associated with major medical conditions such as heart and lung disease, osteoporosis and bodily pain9, disability10, low quality of life11, while there is also evidence that insomnia may result in an increased mortality risk12,13.Sleep problems have also been linked to various mental disorders, including depression14,15. Indeed, insomnia is considered a core symptom of depression16. Research has indicated that sleep problems/insomnia symptoms such as difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep and early morning awakening are common in mood disorders17 and that up to 90% of depressed patients may experience poor quality sleep18&#8211;20. Importantly, there is also a growing body of evidence that sleep problems may increase the risk for negative outcomes in the context of depression.Studies using data from both clinical and community samples have shown that insomnia/sleep disturbance is linked to a poorer quality of life21, functional impairment22, as well as an increased risk for suicidal behaviour23. There is also some indication that sleep difficulties may affect the course and outcome of depression as they have been linked to the severity of depression24,25, poor treatment outcomes (non-remittance)26,27, and depression recurrence in older adults28.However, much of the research on the co-existence of sleep problems and depression has been undertaken in Western/high-income countries and there has been comparatively little systematic research on this comorbidity in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Two recent community-based studies among adults aged 50 and above in several LMICs found that there was a strong association between sleep problems and depression5,29. However, these studies were conducted in a limited number of LMICs and only focused on older adults. In addition, neither study assessed the association between sleep problems and different types of depression, or whether sleep problems comorbid with depression confer additional risk for adverse health outcomes compared to sleep problems alone.Examining the comorbidity between sleep problems and depression is important in this setting as the prevalence of sleep problems has been reported to be high in many LMICs,3,5,29 while it has been estimated that over 80% of the non-fatal disease burden resulting from depression (Years Lived with Disability) occurred in LMICs in 201530. Findings from high-income countries may not be generalizable to LMICs as treatment for both sleep problems and depression is likely to be suboptimal in this setting given that few people receive even minimally adequate treatment for depression alone31 and the underlying causes of depression and sleep problems may differ. Indeed, a recent meta-analysis and systematic review has indicated that there is large geographic (continental) variation in the co-occurrence of sleep disturbance and depressive symptoms in older adults with it being much higher in Europe (18.3%) than Africa (4.5%)32. The need to understand the association between sleep problems and depression in this setting is given further impetus by the changes being brought by globalization and its accompanying social and economic challenges that might result in increased sleep problems in developing countries33. Moreover, as research from the US has indicated that sleep problems in depression are associated with both elevated direct (health care utilization) and indirect costs (e.g. lost work productivity)34, determining their association and combined effects in LMICs may have important clinical implications given their potential to place an even greater burden on health services21.The current study thus had two aims: (i) to examine the association between sleep problems and different types of depression in community-dwelling individuals in LMICs; and (ii) to assess whether comorbid sleep problems and depression are associated with greater decrements in a variety of mental and physical health indicators as compared to sleep problems without depression in this setting.\nData and Methods\n\nThe survey\nThe World Health Survey (WHS) was a cross-sectional survey undertaken in 2002&#8211;2004 in 70 countries. Single-stage random sampling was carried out in 10 countries, while stratified multi-stage random cluster sampling was used in the other 60 countries. Survey details are available from the World Health Organization (WHO) (http://www.who.int/healthinfo/survey/en/). In brief, adults aged &#8805;18 years with a valid home address were eligible to participate. Kish tables were used to ensure that all household members had an equal chance of being selected. To ensure comparability across countries, the survey questionnaire was subject to standard translation procedures. Face-to-face interviews were conducted by trained interviewers. The individual response rate (ratio of completed interviews among selected respondents after excluding ineligible respondents from the denominator) ranged from 63% (Israel) to 99% (Philippines)35. Sampling weights were created using the population distribution as reported by the United Nations Statistical Division to adjust for survey non-response. Ethical boards at each study site provided ethical approval for the survey (see Supplementary Appendix&#160;1) with all participants providing written informed consent. All methods were performed in accordance with relevant ethical guidelines and regulations.\nPrimary variables\n\nSleep problems\nSleep problems were assessed by the question &#8220;Overall in the last 30 days, how much of a problem did you have with sleeping, such as falling asleep, waking up frequently during the night or waking up too early in the morning?&#8221; with answer options none, mild, moderate, severe, and extreme. Those who answered severe and extreme were considered to have sleep problems. This definition has been used in previous publications that have&#160;the same survey question on sleep problems3,5,29.\nSeverity of depressive symptoms\nThe severity of depressive symptoms was established based on the individual questions of the World Mental Health Survey version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI), which assessed the duration and persistence of depressive symptoms in the past 12 months36. Following the algorithms used in a previous WHS publication37, four mutually exclusive groups were established based on the ICD-10 Diagnostic Criteria for Research (ICD-10-DCR)38 where criterion B referred to symptoms of depressed mood, loss of interest, and fatigability. The algorithms used to define the four groups were the following:\nDepressive episode group\nAt least two criterion B symptoms with a total of at least four depressive symptoms lasting two weeks most of the day or all of the day.\nBrief depressive episode group\nSame criteria as depressive episode but did not meet the two-week duration criterion.\nSubsyndromal depression\nAt least one criterion B symptom with the total number of symptoms being three or less. A duration criterion of at least two weeks and presence of symptoms during most of the day had to be met.\nNo depressive disorder group\nNone of the above.Any depression referred to having subsyndromal depression, brief depressive episode, or depressive episode.\nHealth status, perceived stress, anxiety, and observable mental illness\nHealth status was assessed with the use of 10 health-related questions pertaining to five different domains: (a) mobility; (b) self-care; (c) pain and discomfort; (d) cognition; (e) interpersonal activities. These domains correspond to frequently used health outcome measures included in the Short Form 12 (SF12)39, the Health Utilities Index Mark II and III (HUI)40 and the EUROQOL 5D41, and have been used as indicators of health status in prior studies with these data42,43. Each domain consisted of two questions that assessed health function in the past 30 days. Each item was scored on a five-point scale ranging from &#8216;none&#8217; to &#8216;extreme/cannot do&#8217;. In accordance with previous WHS publications44,45, we assessed perceived stress in the last month with the use of two questions which were taken from the Perceived Stress Scale46. Each question was scored on a five-point scale which ranged from &#8216;never&#8217; to &#8216;very often&#8217;. The actual questions used to assess health status and perceived stress can be found in Supplementary Appendix&#160;2. For perceived stress and each separate domain for health status, we used factor analysis with polychoric correlations to obtain a factor score which was later converted to scores ranging from 0&#8211;10045 with higher values representing higher levels of perceived stress or worse health function. Anxiety was assessed by the question &#8216;Overall in the past 30 days, how much of a problem did you have with worry or anxiety&#8217; with response options: none, mild, moderate, severe, and extreme. In accordance with previous WHS publications, those who answered severe and extreme were considered to have anxiety3,47. Observable mental illness was based on the interviewer&#8217;s subjective impression of the presence of mental health problems at the conclusion of the interview.\nControl variables\nThe control variables used in the analysis were selected based on past literature and included sex, age, education, wealth, residential location (rural or urban), physical activity, alcohol consumption, current smoking (no, non-daily, daily), obesity, and chronic physical conditions48,49. Education was based on the highest level of education attained (no formal education, primary education, secondary or high school completed, and tertiary education completed). Country-wise wealth quintiles were created using principal component analysis based on 15&#8211;20 assets depending on the country. Physical activity was assessed with the International Physical Activity Questionnaire, and was categorized as high, moderate, and low based on conventional cut-offs. Alcohol consumption was first assessed by the screening question &#8216;Have you ever consumed a drink that contains alcohol (such as beer, wine, etc.)?&#8217; Respondents who replied negatively were considered lifetime abstainers. If the respondent replied affirmatively, then he/she was asked how many standard drinks of any alcoholic beverage he/she had on each day of the past seven days. The number of days in the past week on which four (female) or five (male) drinks were consumed was calculated, and a total of 1&#8211;2 days and three days or more in the past seven days were considered infrequent and frequent heavy drinking, respectively3. With the exception of lifetime abstainers, all other respondents were considered to be non-heavy drinkers. Obesity was defined as a body mass index of &#8805;30&#8201;kg/m2 based on self-reported weight and height. Seven chronic physical conditions (angina, arthritis, asthma, chronic back pain, diabetes, visual impairment, hearing problems) were assessed and those having at least one of the conditions were considered to have a chronic condition. Arthritis, asthma, and diabetes were based solely on self-reported lifetime diagnosis. For angina, in addition to a self-reported diagnosis, a symptom-based diagnosis based on the Rose questionnaire was also used50. Chronic back pain was defined as back pain (including disc problems) every day during the last 30 days. Visual impairment was defined as extreme difficulty in seeing and recognizing a person that the participant knows across the road (i.e., from a distance of about 20 meters)51. Hearing problems were considered to be present if the interviewer observed this condition at the conclusion of the survey.\nStatistical analysis\nFrom the 69 countries for which data were publicly available, 10 were excluded due to an absence of sampling information. Furthermore, 8 high-income countries were omitted as the short version of the questionnaire was administered in these countries and they lacked data on the majority of the variables used in this study. Spain and the United Arab Emirates were also omitted to focus on LMICs. Finally, Turkey, Latvia, and Morocco were excluded as data on some of the control variables were not collected. Thus, the final sample consisted of 237 023 individuals from 46 LMICs. Based on the World Bank classification at the time of the survey, this corresponded to 21 low-income countries (n&#8201;=&#8201;105 286) and 25 middle-income countries (n&#8201;=&#8201;131 737). The included countries and their sample size are shown in Supplementary Appendix&#160;3. With the exception of China, Comoros, Congo, Ivory Coast, India, and Russia, these data are nationally representative.Statistical analyses were performed with Stata 14.1 (Stata Corp LP, College station, Texas). Multivariable multinomial logistic regression analysis using the overall sample was conducted to assess the association between sleep problems (exposure) and the type of depression (outcome). Three models were constructed to assess the influence of the inclusion of different variables into the model on the sleep problem-depression relationship: Model 1 - adjusted for sociodemographic factors (age, sex, education, wealth, residential location, and country); Model 2 - adjusted for the variables in Model 1 and health behaviour (physical activity, alcohol consumption, smoking); Model 3 - adjusted for the variables in Model 2, obesity, and chronic physical conditions.Next, in order to assess whether the association between sleep problems and any depression is consistent across countries, we conducted country-wise binary logistic regression analysis adjusting for age and sex. The estimates for each country were also combined into a random-effect meta-analysis with the Higgins&#8217;s I2 statistic being calculated. Higgins&#8217;s I2 represents the degree of heterogeneity between countries that is not explained by sampling error with a value of 25% often considered as low, 50% and above as moderate and over 75% as indicating high heterogeneity52.Finally, we conducted separate multivariable linear regression analyses where each of the five health function domains and perceived stress were outcomes and a three-category variable based on a combination of sleep problems and any depression [(a) no sleep problems and no depression; (b) any sleep problems without depression; (c) any sleep problems with depression] was the exposure variable, as well as additional binary logistic regression analyses using observable mental illness and anxiety as the outcome. We used sleep problems without depression as the reference category as our main aim was to assess whether sleep problems with depression confers an additional risk for various health outcomes when compared with sleep problems in the absence of depression. We did not include those with depression without sleep problems in this part of the analysis for this same reason. Adjustment for age, sex, education, wealth, residential location, physical activity, alcohol consumption, smoking, obesity, chronic physical conditions, and country was done. Brazil, Hungary, and Zimbabwe were not included in the analysis with perceived stress as the outcome due to a lack of data.Adjustment for country was conducted by including dummy variables for each country45. To avoid the omission of a large number of individuals from the regression analyses, a missing category was included only for obesity as 29.8% of the data was missing. Taylor linearization methods were used in all analyses to account for the sample weighting and complex study design. Results from linear and logistic regression analyses are presented as &#946;-coefficients and odds ratios (ORs) respectively, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The level of statistical significance was p&#8201;<&#8201;0.05.\nResults\nThe mean (SD) age of the participants was 38.4 (16.0) years; 50.8% were female. The sample characteristics are presented in Table&#160;1. The prevalence of sleep problems and any depression was 7.5% and 11.7%, respectively. Sleep problems were much more common among those with all types of depression with a particularly high prevalence among those with a depressive episode [26.6% vs. 5.2% (no depression)] (Fig.&#160;1). The multivariable analysis showed that sleep problems were significantly associated with all types of depression even after adjustment for sociodemographic factors, health behaviour, obesity, and chronic physical conditions (Model 3) (Table&#160;2). Specifically, the ORs (95% CI) for subsyndromal depression, brief depressive episode, and depressive episode were 2.23 (1.84&#8211;2.70), 2.48 (2.09&#8211;2.95), and 3.61 (3.24&#8211;4.03), respectively (Model 3).Table 1Sample characteristics.CharacteristicCategorySleep problemsYes7.5Depression typeSubsyndromal depression2.5Brief depressive episode2.7Depressive episode6.5Age (years)Mean (SD)38.4 (16.0)SexFemale50.8EducationNo formal26.1Primary31.0Secondary33.7Tertiary9.2WealthPoorest20.1Poorer20.0Middle19.9Richer20.0Richest20.0Residential locationUrban43.1Physical activityHigh63.2Moderate19.4Low17.4Alcohol consumptionLifetime abstainer66.1Non-heavy29.1Infrequent heavy3.8Frequent heavy1.1Current smokingNon-daily5.8Daily20.9ObesityYes9.0Chronic physical conditionYes31.6Abbreviation: SD Standard deviation.Data are % unless otherwise stated.Estimates are based on weighted sample.Figure 1Prevalence of sleep problems by different types of depression.

The association between different combinations of sleep problems and depression with a variety of health outcomes estimated by multivariable regression analyses is shown in Table&#160;3.

The odds for having subsyndromal depression among people with sleep problems more than doubled, and this odds ratio was 3.6 times higher for depressive episode. Sleep problems were associated with significantly increased odds for any depression in 45 of the 46 countries included in the study. Sleep problems with depression (vs. sleep problems alone) conferred additional risk for observable mental illness, anxiety, perceived stress and decrements in health status in the domains of mobility, self-care, pain, cognition, and interpersonal activities.The finding that sleep problems were associated with significantly increased odds for depression concurs with earlier Western population-based studies which have linked sleep problems and depression/mood disorders in cross-sectional analyses53,54 It also accords with the results from previous cross-sectional studies undertaken in several LMICs among young33 and older adults5,29 which found that there was a strong association between sleep problems and depression, but that the strength of the association (as measured by the odds ratio) varied across countries5,29. The exact way in which poorer sleep and depression are linked is uncertain. Although insomnia/hypersomnia is classified as one of the symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD) in DSM-516, findings from a number of recent prospective studies have indicated that insomnia may also be a risk factor for mental illness, including depression, in its own right14,55,56 and that the relationship between depression and insomnia might therefore be bidirectional57,58. A detailed discussion of the mechanisms underlying this association is beyond the scope of this paper although genetic59 and biological factors (e.g. dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis)60 have both been proposed as being important in the association between sleep problems and depression. In addition, it has been suggested that problems in regulating emotions might also play a role in linking sleep problems and depression61.As yet, the research on whether sleep problems and comorbid depression might have an especially detrimental impact on health and well-being has been somewhat limited. Thus, the finding that those with sleep problems and co-occurring depression had a significantly increased risk for a variety of negative health outcomes including worse cognition, mobility, greater pain and more perceived stress compared to individuals both without sleep problems or depression and with sleep problems but without depression has significant public health implications. Importantly, this result accords with those from several earlier studies which showed that individuals with comorbid sleep disorders/insomnia and depressive/mood disorders were more likely to have a lower quality of life62,63 and greater impairment in several (but not all) functional domains compared to those with no or less severe sleep problems22,64. It can only be speculated what underlies this finding. Previous research has indicated that sleep problems are associated with more severe depressive symptoms25 and possibly treatment resistance in depression65 both of which might be important for detrimental health outcomes. In addition, as both sleep problems15,66 and depression67 are independently associated with worse outcomes such as impaired role/social functioning, it is possible that when comorbid, their detrimental effects might be additive or synergistic.This study has several strengths. It used data from mostly representative population samples from a large number of countries, which were collected using a common research methodology and instruments. In addition, it was also possible to examine a variety of outcomes while controlling for a number of covariates. Indeed, to the best of our knowledge it is the first study to examine the association between sleep problems and different forms of depression and how they are associated with various health outcomes in multiple LMICs. It should be acknowledged however, that there are also a number of study limitations. For practical considerations, information on sleep was not collected using polysomnography or actigraphy68 but was rather obtained from self-reports. However, there is evidence that depressed individuals may report some aspects of their sleep quality/problems inaccurately69,70. We also used a single-item question to collect information on sleep. Although this measure related to different sleep problems (difficulty falling asleep, waking at night and early morning awakening), we were not able to examine the effects of these sleep problems individually despite the fact that the strength of the depression-insomnia association may differ across different sleep problems57. It is also possible that variables were missing from the analysis that might have been influential in the observed associations. For example, childhood adversities have been linked to an increased risk for both poor quality sleep71 and depression72 in adulthood. Finally, as this study was cross-sectional it was not possible to establish causality or determine the order in which the observed associations occurred. Prospective research is now needed in LMICs to further elucidate the association between sleep problems and depression both in clinical and community-based samples and how they impact on health and well-being in these countries.The finding that there is a strong association between sleep problems and depression in LMICs and that the comorbidity of these conditions is linked to an increased risk for a number of negative health outcomes highlights the importance of detecting and treating insomnia in depressed individuals in LMICs, especially as there is some evidence that interventions to improve sleep may have a rapid effect on depression73. In terms of this, a combined therapeutical approach is generally suggested for these comorbid conditions74 with research indicating that interventions such as cognitive-behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) and pharmacological treatments may be beneficial for depressed patients with sleep problems75&#8211;77. However, it should be recognized that the widespread adoption of such an approach may prove difficult given the many challenges involved in effectively treating mental illness and its comorbidities in resource-limited countries78. Given this, and other factors, such as the stigma attached to mental ill health78 that can prevent help-seeking behaviour, the fact that insomnia may be a prospective risk factor for depression and other negative health outcomes79, might indicate that early interventions for sleep problems may also be efficacious for mental health80 in LMICs.\nSupplementary information\n\nNone\n\nSupplementary information\n", "pmid": "31427590", "title": "Sleep problems and depression among 237 023 community-dwelling adults in 46 low- and middle-income countries", "journal_title": "Scientific Reports", "authors": "Andrew Stickley;Mall Leinsalu;Jordan E.

Introduction\nNoble metal nanoparticles are well known for their novel applications in the field of catalysis, biotechnology, bio-engineering and environmental remediation [1,2,3,4,5]. In recent years, the synthesis of noble metal nanoparticles as well as their applications, especially in catalysis, is of great interest for further study. Among them, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have attracted considerable attention because of their low cost, strong plasmonic properties and superior catalytic activity [6,7,8]. Several recent efforts to improve the physical properties of AgNPs have focused on synthesis of size- and shape-controlled nanoparticles, which were intended to enhance their catalytic and biological performance [6,7,8,9,10,11]. However, the practical use of individual AgNPs is often hampered by their severe aggregation during the catalytic reactions. In general, there are two main synthetic routes to overcome these limitations and to obtain small AgNPs with large exposed surface area. One is the surface modification of nanoparticles with organic molecules or surfactants in order to stabilize them against agglomeration and the other is the deposition of nanoparticles on a high-surface-area solid support such as metaloxides (SiO2, TiO2, ZrO2, etc.), modified carbons, graphene, or other porous materials. The latter seems to be the most preferred method to sustain the stability and catalytic activity of nanoparticles [6,7,8]. Ag loaded TiO2 (Ag/TiO2) nanocomposites have recently emerged as promising catalysts for use in organic synthesis, because of the combination between TiO2 electronic and optical properties, and Ag catalytic activities in chemical and biological areas. To this end, a variety of approaches have been used to prepare TiO2 supported Ag catalysts, for instance, by photo deposition, chemical deposition and conventional impregnation method [6,7,8,9,10,11,12]. In these studies, however, most of the Ag/TiO2 materials are composed of random aggregates of TiO2 and Ag nanoparticles [6,7,8]. Moreover, the TiO2 nanoparticles tend to agglomerate into bulk structures leading to a significant decrease in surface area and, therefore, in catalytic activity during repeated reactions.Thus far, AgNPs have been successfully used as catalysts for several organic transformations, including C&#8211;C and C&#8211;N cross coupling reactions, cycloaddition and oxidative cyclization reactions, three-component reactions, oxidation of hydrosilanes to silanols, and reduction of imines to the corresponding amines [6,7,8,9,10,11]. In addition, there are several reports for the synthesis of AgNPs supported on different surfaces, which demonstrated their catalytic activity for the reduction of aromatic nitro compounds to the corresponding amines in the presence of sodium borohydride (NaBH4) as reducing agent [13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22]. To our knowledge, only few examples of AgNPs-based catalyst exhibiting high catalytic activity in nitroarenes reduction have been reported, although excess of NaBH4 or hast conditions (high temperature) are required [8,13,14,15,16]. In addition, most of these systems include reduction of nitrophenols by supported AgNPs in aqueous solution [8,17,18,19,20,21,22].We recently reported the synthesis of mesoporous TiO2 nanoparticle assemblies (MTA) using a one-pot chemical route. The MTA was prepared through sol-gel polymerization reaction between TiCl4 and Ti(OPr)4 in the presence of polyoxoethylene cetyl ether (Brij-58) block copolymer template [23,24]. Herein, we report the synthesis of new mesoporous hetero structures consisting of titania and silver nanoparticles (Ag/MTA) and demonstrate the catalytic activity of these materials towards the selective reduction of nitroarenes. The obtained Ag/TiO2 assemblies show large internal surface area with narrow pore-size distribution and exhibit extraordinary activity for nitroarenes reduction. We present a systematic study of the reduction of several substituted nitroarenesto the corresponding anilines and N-aryl hydroxylamines, using NaBH4 and ammonia-borane (NH3BH3) complexes as the reducing agents. Furthermore, a detailed mechanistic route for the AgNP-catalyzed reduction of nitroarenes in the presence of NaBH4 or NH3BH3 is interpreted on the basis of kinetic analysis, as well as on the products identification by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.\n2. Results and Discussion\n\n2.1. Structural Properties of Ag/TiO\nIn this work, we employed commercial available AgNO3 and AgOTf compounds, Degussa P (25) nanoparticles and mesoporous Ag-loaded TiO2 nanoparticle assemblies (Ag/MTA) as catalysts for the selective reduction of various nitro compounds. All commercial catalysts were used as received. Mesoporous Ag/MTA composites with AgNPs loading amounts of 2, 3, 4 and 7 wt % were prepared by photochemical deposition of AgNPs on the surface of nanoparticle-based mesoporous titania (MTA) [24] (see Supplementary Materials for details). Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis of the obtained products evidenced that the Ag loadings in the Ag/MTA composites are very close to those expected from the stoichiometry of the reactions (see Table S1, Supplementary Materials).The mesostructure and crystallinity of the Ag/MTA materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and nitrogen physisorption measurements. The powder XRD patterns (Figure S1, Supplementary Materials) indicated the well-defined crystal structure of Ag/MTA. They show a series of intense diffraction peaks in the 2&#952; = 20&#176;&#8211;80&#176; range, which can be assigned to the anatase structure of TiO2 (JCPDS #21-1272). In addition, the XRD patterns of Ag-loaded samples, especially those containing a high Ag loading (>3%), display weak diffractions at ~44.3&#176; (002), ~64.5&#176; (022) and ~77.4&#176; (113), indicating the formation of metallic silver (JCPDS #04-0783). Figure 1a depicts a representative TEM image of the 4% Ag/MTA sample, which is the most active catalyst studied in this work. It reveals that this material consists of a porous network, which is composed of connected TiO2 and Ag nanoparticles. On the basis of this technique, the average size of TiO2 particles was estimated to be ca. 7&#8211;8 nm, while the diameter of Ag particles was found to be ~3&#8211;4 nm. Note that the average diameters of the TiO2 and Ag nanoparticles were estimated by counting more than 100 particles in several TEM images (Figure S2, Supplementary Materials). To investigate further the crystal structure of mesoporous network, high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) imaging and selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) were performed. The HRTEM images indicate the single-crystal structure of the constituting nanoparticles, showing well-resolved and continuous lattice fringes across the particles. The lattice fringes in Figure 1b,c can be readily assigned to the anatase TiO2 and face-centered cubic (fcc) Ag structure, respectively, in agreement with the XRD results. From the SAED pattern, it appeared that the crystalline structure of 4% Ag/MTA is a mixture of anatase TiO2 and cubic Ag. In agreement with XRD and HRTEM results, all the Debye&#8211;Scherrer diffraction rings can be reasonably assigned to the anatase phase of TiO2 (marker by red curves), while the additional diffraction spots could be indexed as (200) and (311) reflections of the cubic Ag (marker by blue dotted cycles) (Figure 1d).The mesoporosity of the Ag/MTA materials was probed with N2 physisorption measurements at 77 K. The analysis showed that the Ag/MTA exhibit type-IV adsorption-desorption isotherms with H2-type hysteresis loop (Figure S3, Supplementary Materials), which correspond to mesoporous materials with narrow-sized pores. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area and total pore volume of the Ag/MTA were measured to be 119&#8211;128 m2&#183;g&#8722;1 and 0.21&#8211;0.23 cm3&#183;g&#8722;1, respectively, which are slightly lower than those of the parent TiO2 (MTA) sample (surface are ~149 m2&#183;g&#8722;1 and pore volume ~0.27 cm3&#183;g&#8722;1), probably due to the deposition of AgNPs on the TiO2 surface. The pore diameter in Ag/MTA samples was obtained by fitting the adsorption isotherms using the non-local density functional theory (NLDFT) model (assuming slit-like pores), and was found to be ~7.1&#8211;7.4 nm with narrow pore-size distribution. Furthermore, a weak peak at around 5.4&#8211;5.6 nm was observed, especially for the high-Ag-loaded samples (>3 wt %), which could be attributed to the pores filling with AgNPs. Table S1 in the Supplementary Materials summarizes all the textural properties of mesoporous MTA and Ag/MTA materials.\n2.2. Evaluation of the Catalytic Activity\nInitially, we proceeded to optimize the catalytic conditions by studying the reduction of 4-nitrotoluene (1). In Table 1, we show the yields of 4-toluidine (1a) obtained using different Ag-containing catalysts, reducing agents and solvents. Specifically, the catalyst (10 mg) was placed in a 5 mL glass reactor, followed by the addition of solvent (1 mL), nitroarene (0.1 mmol) and hydride compound, and the reaction was vigorous stirred for appropriate time. To our delight, we observed that the 4% Ag/MTA catalyst with 6 mol-excess of NaBH4 in ethanol affords quantitative conversion of 1 into 4-toluidine (1a) within 4 h (Table 1, entry 4).Remarkably, no by-products such as azoxy-, azo- or 1,2-diarylhydrazine were detected during the reaction progress by means of 1H-NMR. In comparison, lower reduction yields of 1a were obtained with Ag/MTA catalysts containing 7 wt % or less than 3 wt % Ag, as shown in Table 1, entries 2, 3 and 5 (see also Supplementary Materials, Figure S4). Meanwhile, TiO2 alone, such as the MTA mesoporous and Degussa P25 nanoparticles (Table 1, entry 1) are largely inactive for the 1 reduction. Although, AgNO3 and AgOTf catalyzed the conversion of 1 in high yields and short reaction time (Table 1, entries 6 and 7), an equimolar amount of the sesaltsis necessary for the reaction completion. In contrast, silver wire does not catalyze any reduction process (Table 1, entry 8). The reaction was incomplete with lower amounts of NaBH4 (less than 2 mol-excess), while using 4 mol-excess of NaBH4 a prolonged reaction time of 24 h was required to obtain 1a in >91% yield (results not shown). In addition, no reduction of 1 was observed under mild conditions, for example, using 1 bar of H2 at room temperature (Table 1, entry 9) or in the presence of transfer hydrogenation reagent such as the 1,1,3,3-tetramethyl disiloxane (TMDS) (Table 1, entry 10). In addition, with dimethylphenylsilane (DMPS), the conversion yield to the corresponding amine (1a) was only 11% (Table 1, entry 11). It is also noted that hydrazine hydrate (NH2NH2&#183;H2O) can be activated under our catalytic conditions proceeding to quantitative reduction of 1, but higher temperature and prolonged reaction time are required (Table 1, entry 12). In contrast, when ammonia-borane (NH3BH3) is used as reducing agent (2.5 mol-excess based on 1) the corresponding N-aryl hydroxylamine (1b) was detected by 1H-NMR as the major product of 1 reduction, accompanying with small amount of amine 1a (Table 1, entry 13). Control experiments showed no appreciable reduction of 1 in the absence of catalyst, indicating that the reduction process is catalytic in nature (result not shown). Finally, the reduction of 1 proceeded also efficiently in MeOH (Table 1, entry 14), while in other non-protic polar or apolar solvents no significant amount of 1a was observed (Table 1, entries 15&#8211;19). Thus, 4% Ag/MTA catalyst in the presence of NaBH4 inethanol affords fast, quantitative, and clean reduction of 1 without the requirement of any chromatographic purification of the product 1a (Table 1, entry 5).After completion of 1, as evidenced by thin layer chromatography (TLC), the slurry was filtered through a short pad of silica to withhold the catalyst with the aid of ethanol (~5 mL). Then, the filtrate was evaporated under reduced pressure to give pure 4-toluidine 1a (98% isolated yield) as a brown solid. It is worth noting that our catalytic conditions are significantly milder(room temperature and 6-mol excess of NaBH4) than those used in other studies, in which similar hydrogenation reactions were examined; however, either large excess of NaBH4 (~25&#8211;800 mol excess), or hast conditions (>100 &#176;C) are required [13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22]. Based on this, our catalytic system is highly feasible for practical use.\n2.3. Chemoselective Reduction of Nitroarenes into Aryl Amines and N-Aryl Hydroxylamines\nTo study the limitation of this chemoselective reduction process, a series of nitroarenes (1&#8211;12) were examined under the above described conditions. As shown in Scheme 1, 4% Ag/MTA catalyst in the presence of NaBH4 (6 mol-excess based on nitroarene amount) produce the corresponding substituted anilines 1a&#8211;12a in excellent yields (>90%) and selectivity (>98%). Moreover, bromo and chloro-substituted nitroarenes (3 and 4) were also reduced without undergoing any dehalogenation, while p-dinitrobenzene (9) was completely converted too diamine (9a) within 4 h. Similarly, carboxylate, and cyano functionalities in 5 and 8 nitroarenes remained intact under the examined conditions, indicating highly chemoselective reduction. Consistent with the above results, the reduction of 6-nitro-isobenzofuran-1(3H)-one (10) gave also the corresponding amine without further transformation of the lacton ring. Notably, 3-nitrostyrene 11 was reduced to the corresponding saturated amine 11a in 70% relative yield, accompanying with a 3-ethyl-nitrobenzene yield of 30% (see Supplementary Materials). This result suggests that the present catalytic system is also active for the preferred hydrogenation of the C=C double bond relative to the nitro group of 11.Nevertheless, when the NH3BH3 (1.5&#8211;2.5 mol-excess based on nitroarene amount) is used as the reducing agent, the corresponding N-aryl hydroxylamines (1b&#8211;12b) are formed under the above described conditions (Scheme 1); indeed, in high relative yields (>84%) and within short reaction times (2&#8211;10 min). 1H-NMR analysis of the crude mixtures showed only a small amount of the corresponding substituted anilines (1a&#8211;10a) (2%&#8211;10%)as byproducts (see Supplementary Materials). As shown in Scheme 1, the reduction of p-nitrophenol (6) produces the corresponding amine 6a as the only product. In this case, N-aryl hydroxylamine 6b was not detected by NMR at initial reaction time (see Supplementary Materials, Figure S5). Reduction of 11 leads to the N-aryl hydroxylamine 11b accompynaning with small amount of the initial nitroarene, however, under the described conditions 12 gave the 12b in 70% relative yield with a significant amount of the corresponding amine 12a (30%), (see Supplementary Materials). It should be noted that the reaction products were kept at room temperature and no further chromatographic purification was performed to avoid decomposition or transformation of the N-aryl hydroxylamines into the corresponding nitrosoarenes, anilines and azoxy- or azo-arenes. In the literature, several synthetic routes towards N-aryl hydroxylamines formation have been reported; however, certain limitations related to the applicability of these reactions (including scale-up synthesis) have been imposed. Since the first procedure using Zn/NH4Cl [25] and the enzymatic nitroreductase system [26], the common synthetic routes associated with the title transformation have focused on the direct hydrogenation (with H2) of nitroarenes using precious metal nanoparticles such as Pd, Pt, Ru, Re and Rh as catalysts [27,28,29,30,31,32,33]. In addition, catalytic transfer hydrogenation reactions of nitroarenes to N-aryl hydroxylamines were also realized using Pt/hydrazine [34], Zn in CO/H2O [35] and Sb/NaBH4 [36] systems, while only recently Au/TiO2 nanoparticles have been employed for the selective nitroalkanes reduction to N-alkyl hydroxylamines [37]. To our knowledge, since now, heterogeneous Ag-catalyzed hydrogenation of nitroarenes to the corresponding N-aryl hydroxylamines is an unknown transformation. These results, accompanying with the observation that N-aryl hydroxylamines are formed in high relative yields and through afast and pure reaction process, suggest that the present catalytic system Ag/MTA-NH3BH3 can be applicable to various hydrogenation reactions, including fine synthesis of N-aryl hydroxylamines.\n2.4. Kinetic Studies\nThe reusability of the 4% Ag/MTA was examined by conducting repeat catalytic experiments. The 4% Ag/MTA catalyst can be easily separated from the reaction mixture by simply filtration and it can be reused for the next catalytic run. As shown in Supplementary Materials, Figure S6, the catalyst can be used at least three times without significant loss of its catalytic activity and selectivity. In order to assess the feasibility of the present catalytic system, the 4% Ag/MTA catalyst was further tested for large-scale production of aryl amines and N-aryl hydroxylamines from nitroarenes. For this reason, 5 mmol of nitroarene 1 were reduced in the presence of 4% Ag/MTA (0.8 mol %) with 8 mol-excess of NaBH4 in 15 mL EtOH. After completion of the reaction (within ~20 h based on TLC analysis), the mixture was filtered upon silica gel, washed with ethanol and purified by column chromatography to afford the corresponding 4-toluedine 1a in 91% isolated yield. As a comparison, under the same reaction conditions but with 3 mol-excess of NH3BH3, the corresponding N-aryl hydroxyamine 1b was obtained at 93% relative yield in 30 min, according to the 1H-NMR analysis of the crude product (results not shown). These results correspond to a turn over number (TON) of about 125 and a turnover frequency (TOF) of 250 h&#8722;1.To propose a plausible mechanistic pathway for the present Ag-catalyzed reduction of nitroarenes, we performed a Hammett-type kinetic study for the reduction of a diverse set of para- and meta-X-substituted-nitroarenes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8 and 12). The kinetic studies were carried out as follow: 0.2 mmol of the nitroarene, 20 mg of 4% Ag/MTA and 0.6 mmol of NaBH4 were added in ethanol (1 mL). A 100 &#956;L aliquot of the mixture was taken at appropriate time and the mixture was filtrated through a short pad of silica (to withhold the catalyst) and washed with ethanol (~1 mL). Then, the filtrate was evaporated under reduced pressure and the consumptions of the corresponding X-substituted nitroarene were determined by integrating the appropriate proton signals in 1H-NMR spectra. Each reaction was repeated at least three times and the average values are depicted in Figure 2 and in the Supplementary Materials, Figures S7 and S8. Considering that the concentration of the possible formed silver-hydride species remains constant at initial times and assuming a pseudo-first order dependence of the reaction rate on the nitroarene concentration, Equation (1) can be applied. (1)ln(x)= &#8722;kt where, k is the rate constant and x is the consumption of the X-substituted nitroarene at reaction time t.According to Equation (1), a plot of the ln(x) versus time gives a linear curve, the slope of which is equal to the rate constant k. The results indicated that the kinetic activity of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8 and 12 nitroarenes is remarkably affected by the nature of the X-substituent group, in which the reduction proceeds faster as the electron-withdrawing ability of the substituent group increases. For example, the reduction of 3 (4-Br), 4 (4-Cl), 5 (4-COOMe) and 8 (3-CN) proceeds in a faster rate than that with the nitrobenzene 7 (X = H) (Figure 2), as indicated by the relative rate constant ratios kCOOMe/kH = 25, kCN/kH = 6.0, kBr/kH = 4.5 and kCl/kH = 1.4, respectively (see also Supplementary Materials, Figures S7 and S8). However, nitroarenes containing electron-donating group, such as 12 (3-NH2), 2 (4-MeO) and 1 (4-Me), were reduced with slower reaction rate (Figure 2); the relative rate constant rations were kNH2/kH = 0.2, kMeO/kH = 0.7 and kMe/kH = 0.9, respectively. In addition to these results, a Hammett-type correlation in the competition of X-substituted nitroarenes (12, 2, 1, 4, 3, 8 and 5) versus nitrobenzene (7) gave positive slopes, i.e., &#961; &#8776; 0.8, R2 = 0.890 (using &#963;+ values) and &#961; &#8776; 0.9, R2 = 0.826 (using &#963; values) (Supplementary Materials, Figure S9). The small &#961; values for these correlations indicate that the reaction mechanism involves either radical intermediates or a transition state with a small charge separation [38]. However, the measured positive &#961; values, are consistent with a proposed mechanism that include a negative charge (or hydride transfer) in the transition state, which is stabilized by electron-withdrawing substituents [38,39].According to the above results, we propose a general mechanistic pathway for the AgNPs catalyzed reduction of nitroarenes. First, a B-H bond cleavage occurs to gives [Ag]-H active species. Such hybrid species are responsible for the rapid reduction of nitroarenes into the corresponding N-aryl hydroxylamines. This assumption is consistent with the kinetics studies showing that nitroarenes bearing electron-withdrawing substituents reduced faster than those with electron donating groups. Finally, N-aryl hydroxylamines are further reduced into the corresponding aryl amines with NaBH4; however, this step becomes slower in the presence of NH3BH3. To shed light on the above hypothesis, the catalytic reductions of electron-donating 2 and electron-withdrawing 5 and 9\np-X-substituted nitroarenes were also separately conducted in CD3OD using 4% Ag/MTA. Each reduction process was monitored directly by 1H-NMR spectroscopy, at initial reaction times. As shown in Figures S10&#8211;S12 of the Supplementary Materials, during the reduction process, the only intermediate products were the corresponding N-aryl hydroxylamines 2b, 5b and 9b.\n3. Experimental Section\n\n3.1. Materials\nBrij 58 surfactant (HO(CH2CH2O)20C16H33, Mn~1124), titanium tetrachloride (99.9%), AgNO3 (>99%), AgOTf, absolute ethanol (99.8%), NaBH4, NH3BH3, TMDS and DMPS were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Darmstadt, Germany). Titanium(IV) isopropoxide (>98%) was purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). TiO2 nanoparticles (P25) were purchased from Degussa AG (Dusseldorf, Germany).The aromatic nitro compounds used as substrates were of high purity and commercially available from Aldrich (Darmstadt, Germany).\n3.2. Synthesis of Ag/MTA Catalysts\nThe mesoporous TiO2 nanoparticle assemblies (MTA) were prepared according to the method reported previous [24]. Ag-loaded TiO2 (Ag/MTA) catalysts with different loading of AgNPs were obtained by photocatalytic reduction method. Typically, 0.2 g of MTA were dispersed into 10 mL of a CH3CN/H2O/ethanol (10:1:1 v/v) solution containing appropriate amounts of AgNO3. The suspension was then illuminated with a 5 mW ultraviolet lamp (&#955; = 365 nm) for 2 h under continuous stirring. The product was then collected by filtration, washed with ethanol, and dried at 60 &#176;C for 12 h. A series of mesoporous Ag/MTA catalysts with different Ag loadings, i.e., x = 2, 3, 4 and 7 wt %, was prepared using 6.4, 9.6, 13.2 and 23.8 mg of AgNO3, respectively.\n3.3. Physical Characterization\nThe X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected using a Panalytical X&#8217;Pert Pro MPD X-ray diffractometer (45 kV and 40 mA, Lelyweg, the Netherlands) with a Cu K&#945; radiation (&#955; = 1.5406 &#197;). Elemental microprobe analysis was performed on a JEOL Model JSM-6390LV scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Tokyo, Japan) system equipped with an Oxford INCA PentaFET-x3 energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) detector (Oxfordshire, UK). Data acquisition was performed several times using an accelerating voltage of 20 kV and 60 s accumulation time. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) experiments were carried out with a JEOL model JEM-2100 electron microscope (LaB6 filament) operating at 200 kV. The sample was dispersed in ethanol by sonication, and the dispersion was then dropped onto a Cu grid covered with carbon film. Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms were measured at liquid N2 temperature (77 K) on a NOVA 3200e volumetric analyzer (Quantachrome, Boynton Beach, FL, USA). Before analysis, samples were degassed overnight at 150 &#176;C under vacuum (<10&#8722;5 Torr) to remove moisture. The specific surface areas were calculated using the Brumauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method [40] on the adsorption data in the 0.06&#8211;0.25 relative pressure (P/Po) range. The total pore volumes were derived from the adsorbed volume at P/Po = 0.99 and the pore size distributions were obtained by the nonlocal density functional theory (NLDFT) method [41] based on the adsorption data.\n3.4. Catalytic Reactions\nSupported silver catalyst Ag/MTA (10 mg) was placed in a 5 mL glass reactor, followed by the addition of ethanol (1 mL), nitro compound (0.1 mmol) and NaBH4 (0.6 mmol) or NH3BH3 (0.25 mmol), and the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for a selected time. The reaction was monitored by thin layer chromatography (TLC), and after completion, the slurry was filtered under pressure through a short pad of silica to withhold the catalyst with the aid of ethanol or methanol (~5 mL). After solvent evaporation the corresponding products were formed in pure forms. Product analysis was conducted by 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectroscopy (Bruker AM 300, Bruker Biospin GMBH, Rheinstetten, Germany and Agilent AM 500, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Identification of the products was realized by comparing the NMR spectra with those of the commercially available pure substances. LC-MS 2010 EV Instrument (Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan) under Electrospray Ionization (ESI) conditions was used for the determination of the mass spectra.Reusability testing of the catalyst was conducted in the case of the 4% Ag/MTA sample through the reduction of 4-nitrotoluene (1). A 2 mL mixture of the feeding solution (0.2 mmol of 1, 1.2 mmol of NaBH4 and 20 mg of catalyst (4 mol % Ag)) was placed into a vial. Each catalytic reaction was stopped after 6 h and the catalyst was collected by filtration, washed with ethanol and dried in an oven at 100 &#176;C for 12 h. Then, the recovered catalyst was used for the next catalytic run without any additional treatment.\n4. Conclusions\nIn conclusion, we have shown that mesoporous titania supported silver nanoparticles (Ag/MTA) can effectively catalyze the chemoselective reduction of nitroarenes into the corresponding aryl amines and N-aryl hydroxylamines, employing NaBH4 and NH3BH3 as reducing agents, respectively. Product analysis and kinetic studies indicated that aryl amine formation proceeds through a reduction pathway involving the initial formation of silver-hydride species; although additional mechanistic studies are required in this direction. In both catalytic processes, the corresponding N-aryl hydroxylamines were observed either as intermediates (with NaBH4) or as the major products (with NH3BH3). Based on the observed high chemoselectivities and the fast and clean reaction processes, both catalytic systems, Ag/MTA-NaBH4 and Ag/MTA-NH3BH3, can be applicable to various hydrogenation reactions, including fine synthesis of amines and N-aryl hydroxylamines, respectively.", "pmid": "28344310", "title": "Reduction of Nitroarenes into Aryl Amines and N-Aryl hydroxylamines via Activation of NaBH4 and Ammonia-Borane Complexes by Ag/TiO2 Catalyst", "journal_title": "Nanomaterials", "authors": "Dimitrios Andreou;Domna Iordanidou;Ioannis Tamiolakis;Gerasimos S.

However, demand for simpler procedures and esthetic restorations has led to the development of prefabricated posts, initially made from metal and more recently from ceramics and fiber-reinforced composites.[11]Fiber-reinforced posts have a modulus of elasticity (21 Gpa) similar to that of dentine (18 Gpa), which allow uniform distribution of forces in the root. They are noncorrosive and are invisible under esthetic restorations and also evert the phenomenon of &#8220;dark root show through,&#8221;[12] and often recommended in flared roots because of lower risk of catastrophic failures and better stress distribution.[13] The &#8220;ferrule effect&#8221; is a longstanding, accepted concept in dentistry that is a foundation principle for the restoration of teeth that have suffered advanced structure loss.[14] A ferrule is defined as a &#8220;360&#176; metal collar of the crown surrounding the parallel walls of the dentine extending coronal to the shoulder of the preparation. This encircled preparation on the tooth provides a protective effect against fracture of the tooth, by reducing stresses within a tooth called the &#8220;ferrule effect.&#8221;[15] Several studies have been performed about ferrule effects which suggested that the ferrule effect strengthens the teeth against functional, wedging, and lateral forces.[16]Clinicians encounter situations where it is not possible to give a full 360&#176; of circumferential ferrule of 2 mm. Different ferrule designs have been suggested according to different clinical situations. In cases where caries frequently affects some walls (primarily the proximal ones), as well as in noncarious lesions such as erosion and abrasion, a partial ferrule of 180&#176; either facial or lingual is beneficial rather than no ferrule.[14]It is important to bear in mind that a ferrule effect is just one part of the restored endodontically treated tooth that represents a complex system. Several studies have been carried out about ferrule length, showing that maintenance of about 2 mm of tooth structure above the finish line or gingival margin as ferrule is effective, but a few studied the effect of different ferrule designs on fracture resistance.[7]\nAim of the study\nThe aim of this study was to investigate the effect of different crown ferrule designs on the fracture resistance of endodontically treated mandibular premolars incorporating fiber posts, composite cores, and crowns.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nPreparation of the specimens\nFifty caries-free, intact human mandibular premolars, extracted for orthodontic reasons were obtained and stored in 10% formalin until use. Only those teeth whose coronal heights were 7 &#177; 1 mm and root lengths 14 &#177; 1 mm were selected. Surface soft tissues and debris were mechanically removed using ultrasonic scalers (P6 Newtron; Acteon Satelec, Merignac, France) with attention not to damage the root surface. Teeth were maintained in normal saline at room temperature.\nRoot canal preparation\nEndodontic access cavities were prepared using a water cooler air turbine handpiece (Unicorn DenMart, India). The teeth were biomechanically prepared using the &#8220;step-back&#8221; technique to a #70 size K-file (Chlorinox, Dentsply Maillefer, USA) and irrigated with 2.6% sodium hypochlorite (Dentpro). Each canal was obturated using the lateral condensation method with Gutta-percha points (Dentsply, USA) and AH 26 sealers (Dentsply, USA). Following root canal obturation, the adequacy of endodontic fillings was confirmed by radiographs exposed from various angles. The endodontic access cavities were filled with a temporary filling material.The specimens were stored in an incubator at 37&#176;C for 1 week as to allow the sealer to set. All teeth were then prepared with a circumferential 1.5 mm shoulder meeting metal-ceramic crown requirements. The prepared clinical crowns were decoronated leaving 2 mm above cementoenamel junction (CEJ), providing different ferrule designs.The samples were divided into five groups each having 10 teeth:\nGroup I: Circumferential ferrule 2 mm above CEJGroup II: 2 mm ferrule only on the facial aspect above CEJGroup III: 2 mm ferrule only on the lingual aspect above CEJGroup IV: 2 mm ferrule on the facial and lingual aspects above CEJ with interproximal concavitiesGroup V: No ferrule (used as control group).\n\nPost space preparation\nThe post spaces of length 8 mm were prepared using 1, 2 and 3 No. Peeso reamers (Mani Inc., Japan) in sequential manner, leaving 4&#8211;5 mm of Gutta-percha inside the canal in the apical third of the root. Glassix fiber posts (Harald Nordin sa, Chailly/Montreux, Switzerland) was cemented in the dried prepared post space using Resin Luting cement RelyX Unicem (3M ESPE, St. Paul, MN, USA), and using core build-up composite material (LuxaCore, Germany), core was built to a height of 6 mm.Metal, ceramic crowns of 7 mm in height were fabricated and were placed using resin cement, using constant finger pressure applied for 40 s then the excess cement was removed.\nBlock preparation and periodontal ligament simulation\nFor building artificial periodontal ligament just like the natural periodontium, root surfaces of all teeth were planned and were marked by a copying pencil 1-2 mm under CEJ. Then, an aluminum foil with 0.2 mm thickness was cut in root form and was adapted to the root dimensions from the marked line to the apex. Samples were merged vertically into the autopolymerized acrylic resin orienting their long axes.After the complete polymerization, samples were taken out of the acrylic in the straight route and the foils were taken off from the root surfaces. Addition of silicon impression material (3M ESPE) in appropriate consistency was injected into the acrylic space to stimulate the natural periodontium.\nTesting fracture resistance\nThe fracture resistance test was performed by using a Universal Testing Machine (Instron Universal Testing Machine Model 8872, Instron Co., Canton, Massachusetts, USA). A unidirectional compressive load was applied to the buccal cusp of crowns, at an angle of 1600 from the long axis of the tooth (to stimulate the functional working side buccal cusp loading), using a cylindrical Ni-Cr alloy rod in universal load testing machine at a crosshead speed of 1 mm/minute until fracture occurred. Fracture force was recorded in Newton (N). Data were analyzed by statistical software (SPSS Statistics version 20.0, SPSS Inc., Illinois, USA), keeping significance level of P < 0.001.\nRESULTS\nThe obtained data showed that maximum amount of loading was sustained by Group I [Table 1]. Group II showed moderate amount of force sustainability [Table 2] as compared to Groups III and IV. Groups III and IV showed nearly equal results [Tables 3 and 4]. The least amount of loading was sustained by Group V [Table 5].SPSS 20.0 software was used to calculate mean and standard deviation [Figure 1]. ANOVA was used for testing the significance between all the groups. There was high to moderate significant difference (critical value F 9.24 with P < 0.001) as well as there was positive correlation between the groups [Tables 6 and 7].\nDISCUSSION\nIt is believed that the presence of ferrule protects the restored teeth because it reinforces the tooth/prosthesis assembly.[16] This portion of dental tissues adjacent to the core increases the fracture resistance,[17] providing a positive effect by reducing the stress concentration on the teeth.[18]Several studies have been carried out about ferrule heights showing that maintenance of about 2 mm of the tooth structure above the finish line or gingival margin is beneficial.[19] In contrast, others found no benefits of adding a ferrule to the preparation.[20] Only a few studied the effect of different ferrule designs on the fracture resistance.[21]A common observation, after deliberate search in endodontic literature, led to a general perception that incorporation of ferrule whether complete or partial is always beneficial in strengthening the teeth against functional, wedging and lateral forces.[14]Juloski[22] stated that to achieve the full benefit of the ferrule effect, it should be a minimum of 1-2 mm in height, have parallel dentine walls, totally encircle the tooth, end on sound tooth structure, and avoid invasion of the attachment apparatus of the tooth. The consensus is that a properly constructed ferrule significantly reduces the incidence of fracture in nonvital teeth by reinforcing the tooth at its external surface and redistributing applied forces which concentrate at the narrowest point around the circumference of the tooth.[23] In addition, it helps to maintain the integrity of the cement seal of the crown.[18]Considering the results obtained, different ferrule designs improve the fracture resistance or the failure pattern of the tested specimens. On the other hand, the use of fiber post with modulus of elasticity close to that of dentin changed the catastrophic failure type to almost complete favorable fracture in all the four groups except the group without ferrule.[11]These results are in agreement with a study conducted by Dikbas[24] to assess the impact of the different types of ferrule on fracture resistance of the upper incisors. Those teeth without post which received endodontic treatment and had the crown showed the highest mean fracture resistance and the group lacking ferrule had the lowest mean among other groups.Although it is clear that a full 360&#176; circumferential ferrule is desirable, there are clinical circumstances where adopting a partial ferrule is still a better option than giving a no ferrule.[14]Facial ferrule of 2 mm above CEJ showed higher fracture resistance when compared with other groups but showed less fracture resistance when compared to circumferential ferrule.Facial and lingual ferrule of 2 mm with interproximal concavities showed almost equal results as that of lingual ferrule. Posterior teeth with deep proximal boxes are a common outcome of interproximal caries which commonly results in a compromised ferrule in these areas.[10] Tjan and Whang[25] in 1986 did a study confirming that a ferrule preparation increases the mechanical resistance by opposing displacement. Tan and Aquilino[26] did a similar study concluding that a tooth with a nonuniform ferrule is more effective at resisting fracture than a tooth with no ferrule but not as effective as a tooth with a uniform 2-mm ferrule.Most of the specimens in the study (90%) showed a failure pattern wherein crown displacement preceded tooth fracture. The highest concentration of stress appeared at the CEJ as sharp angles cause high concentration of stresses during force application.[27] Favorable fractures were observed in all the four groups except the group with no ferrule. Fractures were in oblique direction from lingual to buccal surface involving the middle or apical third of the roots and vertically on buccal surface or below the acrylic resin.[28]As per the results obtained, high significant difference was visible among all the groups which in turn can indicate the fact that the different locations of ferrule will have an impact on the mean fracture resistance that is different from the results which have been achieved in the above-mentioned studies. A facial loading on mandibular premolars teeth may cause stress in the form of tension in the facial margin and may also cause stress in the form of compression in the lingual margin.[27]As these studies were in vitro, it is difficult to achieve standardization with regard to functional age of teeth, morphologic variations of the pulp, and abnormalities in dentin composition before tooth extraction.[28] Differences in dentin composition may affect the resilience of the dentin and thus, change the fracture pattern during compression. These variations were not controlled in this study which probably constitutes a limitation of the present analysis.[29] Hence, it is suggested to carry out similar researches in more simulating conditions to obtain more precise results.\nCONCLUSION\nUnder data obtained in the sample size and limitations of the study, we can conclude that there was a high statistically significant difference among all the groups (P < 0.001). There was maximum fracture resistance in Group I (circumferential ferrule design) and significantly moderate difference was found in Group II (facial ferrule design) when compared with Group III (lingual ferrule) and Group IV (facial and lingual ferrule with interproximal concavities).\nFinancial support and sponsorship\nNil.\nConflicts of interest\nThere are no conflicts of interest", "pmid": "27217642", "title": "Comparative evaluation of the effect of different crown ferrule designs on the fracture resistance of endodontically treated mandibular premolars restored with fiber posts, composite cores, and crowns: An ex-vivo study", "journal_title": "Journal of Conservative Dentistry : JCD", "authors": "Nikita Dua;Bhupendra Kumar;D.

Moreover hyperprolactinemia in women has been reported to be associated with multiple androgenic abnormalities as well as elevated adrenal androgens4&#8211;6). The association, however, has not been universal7,8).It has been suggested that prolactin is a diabetogenic hormone9). Various clinical studies in hyperprolactinemic women with or without pituitary tumors have revealed insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia10&#8211;14). In these studies, impaired glucose tolerance was noted in some but not all women. By contrast, other investigators could not demonstrate a diabetogenic effect of prolactin either in man15) or in animals16). Furthermore, the underlying mechanisms of prolactin-induced changes in insulin release and glucose homeostasis remain unclear.Although insulin resistance or hyperandrogenemia has been commonly found in hyperprolactinemic women, to our knowledge there are few data about the association of insulin resistance and hyperandrogenemia in these women. It has been reported previously that, in women with polycystic ovary syndrome, serum insulin levels are elevated and correlated with hyperandrogenemia17&#8211;20). Recently, androgens have been found to have divergent functional relationship with insulin level, according to the type of androgen secreted21,22).To determine if hyperandrogenemia or insulin resistance occurs in hyperprolactinemic women, basal androgen secretion and both glucose and insulin responses to oral glucose were evaluated in hyperprolactinemic women. The relationship between circulating androgen and insulin levels was also assessed\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n20 hyperprolactinemic women, aged 22 to 57 years (mean age 33 years) with amenorrhea (or oligomenorrhea) and/or galactorrhea were compared with 7 female control subjects. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects. None of hyperprolactinemic women had any illness other than hyperprolactinemia and were on any medication at the time of study. 6 women had macroprolactinoma diagnosed by CT and plasma prolactin level. 14 women had microadenoma or were included in so-called idiopathic hyperprolactinemia. In the women with macroprolactinoma, thyroid hormone and cortisol secretion were normal, as determined by circulating thyroxine and TSH level, cortisol and ACTH levels and clinical status, but the cortisol and growth hormone responses to insulin-induced hypoglycemia were not observed in all women. One macroprolactinoma patient had previously undergone transsphenoidal surgery with persistent hyperprolactinemia (prolactin level: 185 ng/ml at the time of study) and was included in the microprolactinoma group. No differences were found in clinical data and hormonal levels between the women with microprolactinoma or idiopathic hyperprolactinemia and macroprolactinoma except for plasma prolactin level (data not shown).Control subjects, aged 20 to 38 years (mean age 27 years) were recruited from medical and paramedical staff of our hospital. These women had regular ovulatory menses, had been on no medication and had no family history of diabetes mellitus. Blood samples for hormone measurement were collected in the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle.Venous blood was drawn after overnight fast, and serum glucose and insulin levels were measured 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes after a 75 g oral glucose load. The sera were stored at &#8722;20 C until assayed. Glucose was measured by glucose oxidase method. Insulin, prolactin, 17 &#946;-estradiol, DHEAS, total testosterone and free testosterone were measured by specific radioimmunoassay using commercial kits without extraction and chromatographic isolation. Blood pressure was measured on both arms twice, with a mercury sphygmomanometer, with subjects sitting for at least 5 minutes. The mean of 4 readings was used in the analysis. Anthropometric measurements used in this study were body mass index (BMI; kg/m2) and waist-to-hip circumference ratio (WHR; cm/cm). WHR, an index of body fat distribution, was determined by measurement with a tape of waist circumference at the umbilical level and hip circumference at the greater trochanter level of the femur.Results are expressed as mean &#177; S.D or mean &#177; S.E.M. as appropriate. Statistical analysis was done, using an SPSS statistical package. The total area under the serum glucose and insulin profiles (area under curve) was calculated by the following formula: area under curve = {1/2 (fasting value+120-minute value)+30-minute value+60-minute value+90-minute value}&#215;30 minutes. From this, we derived the incremental area under the curve (IAU), i.e., areas between the fasting value and the oral glucose tolerance value profile, because these provide measures of response unconfounded by changes in the fasting level. Between-group differences in mean values were compared using unpaired student&#8217;s t-tests. The serum glucose and insulin responses in the two groups during oral glucose tolerance test were compared in a two-way analysis of variance. The simple and multiple regression analysis was performed according to standard methods. P values were one-tailed. A P value of less than 0.05 was regarded as significant.\nRESULTS\nThe clinical and biochemical characteristics of all study subjects are given in Table 1. Hyperprolactinemic women were more obese, and had higher circulating levels of prolactin and testosterone and lower circulating level of estradiol than control subjects (p0.05). The serum glucose and insulin levels after a 75 g glucose challenge are shown in Fig. 1. During fasting, both serum glucose and insulin levels didn&#8217;t differ in the two groups (79.3&#177;13.6 vs 86.7&#177;7.8 mg/dl; 17.9&#177;11.3 vs 21.8&#177;14.5 &#956;U/ml). After 75 g oral glucose load, both glucose and insulin levels were significantly higher in the hyperprolactinemic women (two-way analysis of variance p=0.001, p<0.001, respectively).Because obesity influences insulin sensitivity, hyperprolactinemic women were divided into obese (BMI&#8805;25) and lean (BMI<25) subgroups. As shown in Table 2, there were no significant differences in clinical data, hormone levels and both glucose and insulin responses to oral glucose between the two groups except for BMI and WHR. However insulin-IAU of the lean hyperprolactinemic women remained higher, compared with control subjects (p<0.05). Therefore all hyperprolactinemic women were pooled in the statistical analysis.Simple and multiple regression were used to examine the relationship between insulin level as dependent variable and other independent variables. The results of simple linear regression are shown in Table 3. There was a significant linear correlation between insulin-IAU and free testosterone level (r=0.47, p<0.05). Table 4 shows the results of multiple stepwise regression for insulin level when all other independent variables were considered. Free testosterone level, mean blood pressure and DHEAS level were the major determinants of insulin-IAU (beta=0.98, p=0.0001; beta=0.58, p=0.002; beat=&#8722;0.67, p=0.003, respectively).\nDISCUSSION\nThe present study demonstrated the close association between elevated free testosterone and insulin resistance in hyperprolactinemic women.In accordance with the results of other studies7,8), our hyperprolactinemic women showed normal serum testosterone level. However, contrary to most1,2,4,6), although not all7,8), reports, hyperprolactinemic women had normal DHEAS level, a main adrenal androgen (Table 1). Although we have no complete explanation for this observed discrepancy, it is possibly due to the small sample size of the present study and the different analytic techniques. The observation of an elevated serum free (unbound) testosterone in hyperprolactinemic women confirms previous reports4&#8211;6). Glickman et al4) and Lobo et al6) found the serum free testosterone level to be increased in hyperprolactinemic women and suggested that elevated free testosterone level may be the consequences of the decrease in the sex hormone-binding globulin, which may result from diminished estrogen levels or direct inhibitory effect of prolactin on the sex hormone-binding globulin in the liver. We did not measure the sex hormone-binding globulin, but serum estradiol level was significantly lower in hyperprolactinemic women in the present study (Table 1). Considering that the circulating levels of androgens represent a balance between the production rate and the metabolic clearance rate, these two parameters must be investigated systematically in order to better define their kinetics in hyperprolactinemic women.In the present study, hyperprolactinemic women exhibited augmented serum glucose and insulin responses to oral glucose in spite of normal fasting serum glucose and insulin levels, compared with control subjects (Fig. 1). These results are in agreement with those of several reports10&#8211;13). Only one hyperprolactinemic woman fulfilled the criteria of impaired glucose tolerance23). In two other studies11,12), fasting hyperinsulinemia as well as increased insulin response to oral glucose have been also noted. In one of the investigations, the insulin response was reduced after administration of bromocryptine, a known antagonist of prolactin secretion10). The present study comprised a heterogeneous group of hyperprolactinemic women, where the diagnosis of macroprolactinoma was included and weight which is known to seriously effect insulin levels24,25) was not controlled. When these factors were taken into consideration, hyperprolactinemic women still showed a significantly higher insulin response to oral glucose than control subjects (Table 2). These results indicate that hyperprolactinemia has a direct correlation with elevated insulin level, independent of body weight. In contrast, Hagen et al15) have reported that a centrally-acting dopamine antagonist, sulpiride-induced hyperprolactinemia in normal men, did not change blood glucose, plasma immunoreactive insulin level, hepatic insulin removal and glucose utilization during basal conditions or after i.v. glucose administration. The discrepancy between the report of Hagen et al15) and the other reports including the present study10&#8211;14) could be due to the transient and less pronounced hyperprolactinemia induced in the normal men in his study. Whereas, we and other investigators studied women with pituitary tumors. The underlying mechanism of hyperinsulinemia in women with chronic prolactin excess was not pursued in the present study. Various experimental and clinical studies suggest that severe hyperprolactinemia is associated with a diminished sensitivity of peripheral tissue to insulin9&#8211;11,14). In fact, our findings of hyperinsulinemia in the presence of mild glucose intolerance reflect insulin resistance. Schernthaner et al11) reported that hyperprolactinemic women had impaired insulin receptor binding in vitro, which might decrease insulin effectiveness in vivo. The existence of in vivo insulin resistance in severe hyperprolactinemia was also supported by the findings obtained in hyperglycemic clamp study showing diminished peripheral insulin sensitivity14).We could not demonstrate the relationship between insulin-IAU and DHEAS in hyperprolactinemic women using simple linear regression (Table 3). However, when multiple stepwise regression was used to compensate for correlation of other independent variables, a negative correlation between them emerged (Table 4). This finding is consistent with the report of Schriok et al21) who described insulin-IAU was negatively related to DHEAS in women with elevated DHEAS, using multiple stepwise regression. Despite some inconsistency in results, negative correlations between DHEAS and insulin level have been observed with total testosterone exhibiting the opposite trend in hyperandrogenic females17&#8211;19,21,22). We found free testosterone level, not total testosterone, to be correlated significantly with insulin-IAU (Table 3, 4). The present study is the first one that shows the evidence for the association of free testosterone level and insulin resistance in hyperprolactinemic women. However no correlation of body mass index and insulin resistance was found. Furthermore insulin levels were similar between obese and nonobese hyperprolactinemic women (Table 2). It is well-known that weight is a major determinant of insulin resistance24,25). Shoupe et al19) and Givens et al26) found the highly significant correlation of insulin-IAU and free testosterone or body mass and suggested that both obesity and free testosterone level are important in the development of insulin resistance in hyperandrogenic women. The reasons for this discrepancy are not readily apparent but may relate to the differences in the study subjects (hyperprolactinemic women vs. other hyperandrogenic women including polycystic ovary syndrome) and the small sample size of the present study.While the association of insulin level and free testosterone do not prove cause and effect, our findings that there is a positive correlation between insulin and free testosterone suggest either a role of hyperandrogenemia in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance or implicate the reverse. Several investigators have provided the evidence to suggest that hyperandrogenemia can induce insulin resistance27,28). On the contrary, it has been reported recently that the elevated insulin levels can enhance ovarian steroidogenesis29). Moreover, insulin resistance has been found to persist in women with polycysic ovary syndrome after surgery or treatment, which results in normalization of androgen20). Further studies are needed to define the true role that hyperandrogenemia plays in insulin resistance in hyperprolactinemic women. We didn&#8217;t investigate the changes of insulin and free testosterone levels after treatment of hyperprolactinemia.The positive correlation of mean blood pressure with insulin-IAU in the present study was unexpected. This cannot be explained. There have been several epidemiologic and clinical data showing that insulin resistance and compensatory hyperinsulinemia are directly and possibly even causally related to hypertension30). The hyperprolactinemic women in the present study, however, had normal blood pressure.In conclusion, the results of the present study indicate that hyperprolactinemia is associated with elevated free testosterone level and an insulin resistance state, and suggest that free teststerone and DHEAS may exert opposite effects on insulin action in hyperprolactinemic women.", "pmid": "8268149", "title": "Direct Relationship between Elevated Free Testosterone and Insulin Resistance in Hyperprolactinemic Women", "journal_title": "The Korean Journal of Internal Medicine", "authors": "Seong Yeon Kim;Yun Ah Sung;Kyung Soo Ko;Bo Youn Cho;Hong Kyu Lee;Chang-Soon Koh;Hun Ki Min", "doi": "10.3904/kjim.1993.8.1.8", "score": "0.013974407"}, {"keywords": "Colorectal carcinoma;CpG island methylator phenotype;DNA methylation;Wnt pathway", "abstract": "Purpose\nDysregulation of the Wnt pathway is a crucial step in the tumorigenesis of colorectal cancer (CRC).

Pyrosequencing was used to examine the methylation of 10 CpG island loci in DNA extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens. To elucidate the predictive role of DNA methylation markers, Kaplan-Meier survival estimation and Cox regression were performed for progression-free survival and overall survival (OS).Results\nThe methylation frequencies of the 10 genes analyzed (p16, p14, MINT1, MINT2, MINT31, hMLH1, DKK3, WNT5A, AXIN2, and TFAP2E) were 47.9%, 10.8%, 21.1%, 16.0%, 20.6%, 0.5%, 53.1%, 32.0%, 2.6%, and 2.1%, respectively.

In cancers with CIMP, aberrant methylation of cytosine nucleotides within these CpG islands can lead to silencing of tumorsuppressor genes, which in turn promotes cancer development. CIMP is reproducibly observed in approximately 15% of CRC cases, and the subgroup defined as CIMP is characterized with high rates of KRAS or BRAF mutation.456 A recent meta-analysis showed that CRC patients with CIMP have a worse prognosis than those without CIMP.7 The CIMP subtype is more enriched in the right side colon when compared with the left side colon, thereby conferring a prognostic impact on CRC.78Aberrant activation of the Wnt signaling pathway is one of the first events in CRC carcinogenesis. Genomic and epigenomic abnormalities in genes regulating the Wnt pathway, such as APC and AXIN2, are observed in most CRC patients. A decrease in the inhibitory proteins of the Wnt pathway can promote the proliferation and metastasis of CRC, and may be a determinant of a patient's prognosis. DKK 1-3, WNT5A, and AXIN2 are negative regulators of the Wnt pathway, and they are frequently repressed by promotor methylation in CRC.910\nAXIN2, one of the genes that predicts high recurrence of surgically resected CRC, is derived from cancer stem cells and has been incorporated into methylation signatures.11 A German group reported that hypermethylation of TFAP2E results in downregulation of DKK4 and is a predictor of chemotherapy resistance in CRC.12 CRC with loss of WNT5A expression and hypermethylation of WNT5A was reported to be associated with a poor prognosis in a previous study.13The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of the methylation status of four Wnt pathway genes (DKK3, WNT5A, AXIN2, and TFAP2E) in metastatic or recurrent CRC patients. In addition, we explored the prognostic impact of the methylation status of an additional six genes from the classic CIMP panel.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nStudy population\nWe included 236 patients with metastatic or recurrent CRC whose primary or metastatic tumor specimens were sufficient for evaluating methylation status by pyrosequencing. All patients were treated with first-line chemotherapeutics at Severance Hospital, Yonsei University from June 1999 to June 2010. Demographic and clinical information was obtained from the electronic medical records of Severance Hospital, and survival data were retrieved from the tumor registry at the Yonsei Cancer Center. Exclusion criteria comprised co-existing malignancies (except for non-melanoma skin cancer or in situ cervical cancer), cancer other than adenocarcinoma, and insufficient amount of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue for DNA extraction. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Yonsei University Severance Hospital, Seoul, Korea (IRB Number 4-2013-0134).\nTumor mutation and methylation analysis\nGenomic DNA from FFPE tissues was extracted using the QIAamp DNA FFPE tissue kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). Extracted tumor DNA was used to evaluate the mutation status of KRAS at codons 12 and 13 and BRAF at codon 600 and the methylation status of six CpG islands from a classic CIMP panel (MINT1, MINT2, MINT31, hMLH1, p16, and p14) and four Wnt pathway-related genes (DKK3, WNT5A, AXIN2, and TFAP2E). The DNA was first treated with bisulfite, using an EZ Methylation kit (Zymo Research, Orange, CA, USA), and then pyrosequencing was performed using the PyroMark Q24 instrument (Qiagen). The detailed protocol for DNA mutation and methylation status evaluation using a pyrosequencer has been described in previous reports.814 The methylation status of CpG island markers was based on a threshold value of 15% (negative, methylation level <15%; positive, methylation level &#8805;15%). The numbers of CpGs analyzed in the pyrosequencing assay were 2 for AXIN2, DKK3, and TFAP2E and 3 for WNT5A. Given that the concordance in methylation between the adjacent CpGs was very high for all four genes, we used average methylation for our analysis. A CIMP-positive tumor was defined as one in which two or more CIMP markers were methylation positive. Patients were divided into three groups based on the methylation status of the 10 evaluated genes (group 1, 0 methylation; group 2, 1&#8211;2 methylations; group 3, 3 or more methylations).\nTreatment and efficacy assessment\nAll patients were treated with 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan as single agents or in combination. The dose and schedule of the FOLFOX and FOLFIRI regimens were the same as those described in other studies or guidelines. As a routine clinical protocol, tumor assessment for response to chemotherapy was evaluated every 8 to 12 weeks, using CT scanning or magnetic resonance imaging in accordance with the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) ver. 1.1. Overall survival (OS) was calculated from the first day of diagnosis to the day of death or the last follow-up visit. Progression-free survival (PFS) was calculated from the first day of chemotherapy to the time of the first documentation of progression, death from any cause, or the date of last follow-up visit if no events had occurred. Objective response rate (ORR) was calculated as the proportion of complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) by RECIST criteria.\nStatistical analysis\nClinicopathologic variables were used as categorical variables. The difference in categorical variables and ORR was assessed by the chi-square or Fisher's exact test. Survival curves were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method for OS and PFS, with 95% confidence interval (CI) for the median time to event. The log-rank test was used to compare the distribution of survival between groups in a univariate analysis. Multivariate analyses were carried out using the Cox proportional hazard regression model, including variables with p<0.10 in the univariate analysis. Two-sided p-values of <0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance. All analyses were performed using SPSS for Windows, version 18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).\nRESULTS\n\nBaseline characteristics and genomic test\nA total of 194 patients had sufficient amounts of tumor DNA extract for methylation analysis (Table 1, Supplementary Tables 1 and 2, only online). Approximately two-thirds (n=127) of the patients were male, and half (n=107) had metastatic CRC at the time of initial diagnosis. The primary tumor was located in the right and left side of the colon in 22.2% (n=43) and 77.9% (n=151) of patients, respectively. Microsatellite instability (MSI) status was known in 140 patients, of which five were MSI-high. Based on the classic definition of CIMP, 59 (30.4%) patients were classified as CIMP positive. Genomic tests of KRAS and BRAF and the methylation status of Wnt genes are summarized in Table 2. Mutations in KRAS and BRAF were detected in 64 (33.0%) and 8 (4.1%) patients, respectively. CIMP-positive tumors harbored a significantly higher frequency of KRAS mutation than CIMP-negative tumors did (44.1% in CIMP+ vs. 28.1% in CIMP-; chi-square, p=0.03) (Fig. 1). The frequency of BRAF mutation was also significantly higher in CIMP+ tumors (11.9% in CIMP+ vs. 0.7% in CIMP-; Fisher's exact test, p=0.01) (Fig. 1). Based on methylation status, 38 (19.6%), 92 (47.4%), and 64 (33.0%) patients were divided into groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The mean number of methylations was higher in proximal-located CRC tumors (2.63, standard deviation 2.11) than in distal-located CRC tumors (1.91, standard deviation 1.72). The most frequently methylated marker in group 3 was p16 (85.9%; 55 of 64 patients).\nMethylation status and response to chemotherapy\nAmong the 194 patients included, 167 received palliative first-line chemotherapy after diagnosis of metastatic or recurrent CRC. Surgical removal of metastatic lesions was amenable in 39 (23.4%) patients, and they were excluded from the ORR analysis. The 27 patients who did not receive palliative chemotherapy were excluded from both the ORR and survival analyses. More than two-thirds of the patients who received palliative first-line treatment were treated with either FOLFOX or FOLFIRI (n=114, 68.3%). The remaining patients were treated with either molecular targeted agents, such as bevacizumab or cetuximab (n=35, 20.9%), or single agents, such as 5-FU or Capecitabine (n=18, 10.8%). In 128 patients who did not undergo metastasectomy, ORR (CR+PR) was observed in 63 (49.2%), and 10 (7.8%) had only non-measurable lesions according to the RECIST criteria. The number of methylations in a CRC tumor sample was significantly associated with the ORR of first-line chemotherapy (Fig. 2). The ORR was 66.7%, 46.3%, and 43.2% in group 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Only one (4.2%) patient experienced progressive disease (PD) in group 1, whereas nine (13.4%) had PD in groups 2 and 3.\nMethylation status and survival\nWith a median follow-up time of 38 months, 131 (67.5%) of the 194 patients died. However, we only selected the 167 patients who received first-line chemotherapy for our survival analysis. None of the 10 methylation sites was associated with OS in a univariate analysis. CIMP-positive patients exhibited a trend toward shortened survival, when compared with CIMP-negative patients (log-rank, p=0.16) (Fig. 3A). Nevertheless, we found that a higher number of methylations was associated with shorter OS. The median OS was 39.1, 39.7, and 29.1 months in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively (log-rank, p=0.013) (Fig. 3B). In distal-located primary tumors, there was a statistically significant association between the number of methylations and the OS (n=132, median OS 39.1 months in group 1 vs. 43.0 months in group 2 vs. 31.2 months in group 3; p=0.011); however, this was not observed in proximal-located tumors (n=35, median OS 34.7 months in group 1 vs. 25.5 months in group 2 vs. 29.1 months in group 3; p=0.688).Group 1 had statistically non-significant longer PFS of first-line chemotherapy than group 2 or 3 did. The median PFS was 9.2, 7.6, and 7.0 months in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively (log-rank, p=0.198). In the 128 patients who did not undergo metastasectomy, the median PFS was 9.1, 6.4, and 6.7 months, respectively (log-rank, p=0.075). This trend toward improved survival in group 1 was also observed in the 39 patients who underwent metastasectomy: not reached, 49.6 months and 44.4 months in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively (p=0.429).Among the variables that were significantly associated with OS in the univariate analyses [age, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS), histologic grade, American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage at diagnosis, BRAF mutation, resectability at the time of metastasis, objective response of chemotherapy], the number of methylations was independently associated with decreased survival in all patients (OS for 0&#8211;2 methylations vs. &#8805;3 methylations; hazard ratio, 1.72, 95% CI, 1.16&#8211;2.56; p=0.007) (Table 3).\nDISCUSSION\nIn this study, we evaluated the methylation status of DKK3, WNT5A, AXIN2, and TFAP2E in patients with metastatic or recurrent CRC. Although a single methylation of one of the four genes was not associated with the prognosis of our subjects, higher numbers of methylations among the 10 evaluated genes was independently associated with poorer clinical outcome. In chemotherapy-treated CRC patients, OS was significantly longer in groups 1 and 2 than in group 3. In patients with measurable disease, the ORR was significantly higher in group 1 than in group 2 or 3, and the median PFS was numerically higher in group 1 than in group 2 or 3.We selected four Wnt pathway genes and six classic CIMP panel genes because aberrant genomic or epigenomic changes of the Wnt signaling pathway are crucial in CRC carcinogenesis and progression. Methylation of DKK3 was present in 53.1% of our patients, and was not associated with survival. Similarly, in a previous study by Yu, et al.,15\nDKK3 methylation was detected in 67 of 128 (52.3%) patients with CRC tumors, and was not predictive of patient survival. However, they reported that DKK3 methylation status may be of potential use as a prognostic marker in patients with gastric cancer who may benefit from aggressive treatment. Methylation of WNT5A has been detected in 18&#8211;54% of CRC tumors in previous studies.81617\nWNT5A has been studied as an important functional and prognostic marker in various cancers. In CRC, Rawson, et al.17 evaluated the largest cohort of 1232 patients, and showed that WNT5A was strongly associated with sporadic MSI-high tumors without prognostic implication, in concordance with the present study. These findings may indicate that the role of the Wnt signaling pathway varies between CRC subtypes, depending on the epigenetic event of related genes.Methylation of AXIN2 and TFAP2E was detected only in 5 (2.6%) and 4 (2.1%) patients, respectively, in the current study. Therefore, the number of patients was too small to analyze the prognostic impact of these genes. There are several possible reasons for why the frequency of methylation in both genes was lower than that reported in other western studies. First, the Asian ethnicity of our study population could have influenced the results. Yoon, et al.18 reported that CRC from Asians have a lower rate of BRAF and KRAS mutations than that from people of African descent and Caucasians. Given that previous studies have reported that methylation of AXIN2 and TFAP2E is correlated with BRAF mutation, the tumors in our study population may have intrinsically lower rates of methylation. Second, the study method used to detect CpG island methylation was different from that used in previous studies. Pyrosequencing is not as sensitive, but is specific, for detecting methylation status, compared to methylation-specific PCR, which has been utilized in many previous studies. However, some proportions of AXIN2 and TFAP2E methylation could be false positives, given that miss-priming of methylation-specific PCR frequently occurs during experiments.19 In addition, low tumor purity or tumor heterogeneity of biopsy specimens from metastatic CRC patients may have contributed to the low frequency of methylation: other studies examined the methylation status in operation specimens from early CRC patients.Wnt pathway methylation is easy to assess in routine clinical practice, when compared with whole-genome or transcriptome analysis. In addition, the advantage of a DNA methylation marker is its stability and reproducibility, in contrast to RNA-based biomarkers, and actionability with demethylating agents, such as 5-Aza. Accordingly, recently, an international consortium attempted to share large-scale data and enable the classification of CRC into four consensus molecular subtypes (CMSs).20 CMS4 subtype CRC patients exhibit worse prognosis than patients with other subtypes, and show low Wnt activity, which might have resulted from repression of Wnt pathway genes by CpG island methylation. Interestingly, De Sousa E Melo, et al.11 documented that a stem cell-derived gene signature (mesenchymal features with chemotherapeutic resistance and high TGF-&#946; signaling) was closely related to methylation-dependent tuning of the Wnt expression program.The main limitations of our study are its retrospective nature and the heterogenous treatment protocols. Therefore, our results need to be validated in future prospective studies. Another study limitation is that we did not evaluate the extended RAS mutations (in exons 3 and 4 of KRAS and exons 2, 3, and 4 of NRAS) or the MSI status of all patients. However, this should not have a significant impact on our results because most of our patients did not receive anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody. Lastly, the absence of a consensus panel defining CIMP subgroups is a hurdle to be overcome with comparison with other future studies.In conclusion, we found that a higher number of methylations among the 10 genes evaluated, comprising four Wnt pathway genes and six classic CIMP panel genes, was independently associated with poorer clinical outcomes in CRC patients. Further validation of these markers in prospective settings and early stage patients will guide CRC patients to more personalized treatment planning and, hopefully, improve clinical outcomes in the future.", "pmid": "29869456", "title": "CpG Island Methylator Phenotype and Methylation of Wnt Pathway Genes Together Predict Survival in Patients with Colorectal Cancer", "journal_title": "Yonsei Medical Journal", "authors": "Se Hyun Kim;Kyu Hyun Park;Sang Joon Shin;Kang Young Lee;Tae Il Kim;Nam Kyu Kim;Sun Young Rha;Joong Bae Ahn", "doi": "10.3349/ymj.2018.59.5.588", "score": "0.0138390325"}, {"keywords": "sciatic nerve;ischemia/reperfusion;tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 converting enzyme;N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist;inducible nitric oxide synthase;tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1", "abstract": "Inhibition of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor by MK-801 reduces ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in the central nervous system. However, few previous studies have evaluated the neuroprotective effects of MK-801 against peripheral I/R injury. The present study aimed to investigate the protective effects of MK-801 pretreatment against I/R injury in the rat sciatic nerve (SN). Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to a sham surgery (n=8) or to a 5-h ischemic insult by femoral artery clamping (I/R and I/R+MK-801 groups; n=48 per group). I/R+MK-801 rats were intraperitoneally injected with MK-801 (0.5 ml or 1 mg/kg) at 15 min prior to reperfusion. The rats were sacrificed at 0, 6, 12, 24, 72 h, or 7 days following reperfusion. Plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide (NO) concentrations, and SN inducible NO synthase (iNOS) protein expression levels, were measured using colorimetry. In addition, the protein expression levels of tumor necrosis factor-&#945; (TNF-&#945;) were measured using immunohistochemistry, and histological analyses of the rat SN were conducted using light and electron microscopy. Alterations in the mRNA expression levels of TNF-&#945; and TNF-&#945; converting enzyme (TACE) in the rat SN were detected using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. In the I/R group, plasma concentrations of NO (175.3&#177;4.2 &#181;mol/l) and MDA (16.2&#177;1.9 mmol/l), and the levels of iNOS (2.5&#177;0.3) in the SN, peaked at 24 h post-reperfusion. At 24 h, pretreatment with MK-801 significantly reduced plasma NO (107.3&#177;3.6 &#181;mol/l) and MDA (11.8&#177;1.6 mmol/l), and SN iNOS (1.65&#177;0.2) levels (all P<0.01). The mRNA expression levels of TNF-&#945; and TACE in the SN were significantly reduced in the I/R+MK-801 group, as compared with the I/R group (P<0.05). Furthermore, MK-801 pretreatment was shown to have alleviated histological signs of I/R injury, including immune cell infiltration and axon demyelination. The results of the present study suggested that pretreatment with MK-801 may alleviate I/R injury of the SN by inhibiting the activation of TNF-&#945; and reducing the levels of iNOS in the SN.", "body": "Introduction\nPeripheral nerve injury is a complication that is commonly observed following orthopedic surgery or trauma (1&#8211;3). Peripheral nerve ischemia and reperfusion (I/R), which may be the cause of nerve injury, may occur following incision for pressure-relief in extremity intracompartment syndrome, during compression for repair of vascular rupture or from nerve trunk oppression (4). Numerous interacting mechanisms may contribute to axonal degeneration following I/R, including immune cell activation/infiltration, calcium dysregulation, and free radical generation (5).In the central nervous system (CNS), glutamate release and the concomitant overstimulation of synaptic glutamate receptors, particularly the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype, is a critical early event in I/R injury (6). The involvement of glutamate receptors in I/R injury has been extensively studied in the CNS (5); however, peripheral nerves also express glutamate receptors, which may contribute to axonal injury and nerve dysfunction, including initiation of neuropathic pain (7&#8211;13). Oxidative stress is a hallmark of peripheral nervous system (PNS) axon I/R injury, and occurs due to the generation of free-radicals (4,14&#8211;17). Free-radical scavengers have previously been shown to mitigate I/R injury in the PNS (18). Activation of nitric oxide (NO) synthase (NOS) may induce oxidative damage during I/R (19&#8211;22); NO is highly reactive and may form toxic reactive nitrogen species during reperfusion (23,24). Conversely, as a major vascular relaxation factor, NO may also protect against ischemic injury (25).The pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#945; has previously been shown to be upregulated in ischemic peripheral nerves (26,27). Conversely, downregulation of TNF-&#945; expression levels appeared to protect peripheral nerve integrity and mitigate neurological sequela (28). TNF-&#945; activity is influenced by the TNF-&#945; converting enzyme (TACE) (29). Therefore, TACE has been considered a potential therapeutic target for CNS inflammatory disorders (29); however, there is limited information regarding its function in the PNS. In a previous study, stress-induced increases in TACE activity, and increased expression levels of TNF-&#945;, were blocked by the noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 (30). This was consistent with the results of previous studies, which demonstrated neuroprotective effects for MK-801 in various models of strokes (31,32).The present study hypothesized that MK-801 may protect peripheral nerves against I/R injury by inhibiting the activation of TNF-&#945; by TACE, and thereby suppressing inflammation-mediated damage, and by inhibiting the activation of iNOS, and thereby suppressing oxidative damage. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the effects of MK-801 on the expression levels of TNF-&#945;, TACE and iNOS, and the peripheral nerve histology, in a rat model of I/R injury.\nMaterials and methods\n\nNone\n\nAnimals\nA total of 104 male Sprague-Dawley rats (age, 8&#8211;9 weeks; weight, 250&#8211;300 g) were supplied by the Animal Laboratory of the Fujian Medical University (Fuzhou, China). The rats were maintained under a 12-h light/dark cycle at 20&#8211;25&#176;C and 50&#177;5% humidity, with ad libitum access to food and water. The rats were acclimatized for 1 week prior to the experiments. All procedures and animal experiments were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Fujian Medical University, and were conducted in accordance with all state regulations.\nRat model of sciatic nerve I/R injury\nThe rat model of SN I/R injury was established as described in a previous study (33). Briefly, the rats were fasted for 12 h, with ad libitum access to water, prior to experiments. Subsequently, the rats were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection with 3% pentobarbital sodium (30 mg/kg; Maixin Biological Technology Development Co., Fuzhou, China) and placed onto the operating board in the supine position. The groin on the right side was depilated using a knife and disinfected with iodine complex, after which a bevel cut was made in the right lower quadrant. In order to induce lower limb ischemia, the right arteria iliaca communis, femoral artery and arteria circumflexa iliaca superficialis were clamped for 5 h with micro-artery forceps using an extraperitoneal approach.\nAnimal grouping\nThe rats were randomly divided into the following groups: i) Sham group (n=8); ii) I/R group (n=48); and iii) I/R+MK-801 group (n=48). The rats in the sham group were subjected to anesthesia, skin preparation involving depilation and disinfection with iodine, and bevel cutting into the right groin; however, the arteries were not clamped. Blood samples (8 ml) were obtained from all rats and the right SN were collected 24 h after stitching of the wound.The rats in the I/R group underwent I/R and were injected intraperitoneally with 0.5 ml normal saline at 15 min prior to reperfusion. The rats in the I/R+MK-801 group underwent I/R and were intraperitoneally injected with 0.5 ml MK-801 (1 mg/kg; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) at 15 min prior to reperfusion. The rats in the I/R and I/R+MK-801 groups were divided into six subgroups (n=8 per subgroup), depending on the time at which they were sacrificed following reperfusion (0, 6, 12, 24, 72 h, or 7 days). Rats in the same subgroup did not vary in body weight by >10 g. Blood samples were collected from the jugular vein immediately prior to sacrifice. The rats were sacrificed by acute blood loss following anesthetization with 10 mg/kg xylazine hydrochloride (Maixin Biological Technology Development Co.) and 70 mg/kg ketamine (Maixin Biological Technology Development Co.). Following sacrifice, a 5-cm section of the ipsilateral SN, ending 2 cm above the right knee joint, was removed.\nDetection of iNOS activity in SN tissues\nA 0.5-g sample of SN was rinsed with ice-cold normal saline for removal of blood, dried with filter paper, and homogenized in ice-cold normal saline (dilution, 1:9) containing 0.86% sodium chloride. The concentration of iNOS was detected using a Nitric Oxide Synthase typed assay kit (A014-1; Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China) and a type 721 spectrophotometer (Shanghai Precision & Scientific Instrument Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China). The protein concentration was quantified using a Bicinchoninic Acid Protein Assay kit (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Nantong, China), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Activity of iNOS is expressed per mg of proteins.\nPlasma NO levels\nThe plasma concentration of NO was determined using a commercial NO Assay kit (A012; Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Absorbance was measured at 550 nm using the type 721 spectrophotometer (Shanghai Precise Scientific Instrument Co., Ltd.).\nPlasma malondialdehyde (MDA) levels\nThe plasma concentration of MDA was detected in 0.1 ml plasma samples using the MDA Assay kit (A003-1; Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Absorbance was measured at 721 nm using a type 721 spectrophotometer (Shanghai Precise Scientific Instrument Co., Ltd.).\nHematoxylin & eosin (H&E) staining\nSNs were collected, fixed with 10% formaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. Slices (4 &#181;m) were prepared and heated at 60&#176;C for 6 h to dry. Following removal of paraffin, the slices were stained with H&E (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) and visualized under an inverted phase contrast microscope (Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan).\nImmunohistochemical analysis\nProtein expression levels of TNF-&#945; in the SN were measured using the Elivision TM Plus Polymer HRP (Mouse/Rabbit) Immunohistochemistry kit (Maixin Biological Technology Development Co.) based on streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase visualization (Wuhan Boster Bio-Engineering Co., Ltd., Wuhan, China). Tissue slices were incubated with rabbit anti-mouse TNF-&#945; polyclonal antibody (1:100; BA14901; Wuhan Boster Bio-Engineering Co., Ltd.) at 4&#176;C overnight. After washing in phosphate-buffered saline (Maixin Biological Technology Development Co.), labeled slices were incubated with biotin-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G polyclonal antibody (1:10,000; BA1001; Wuhan Boster Bio-Engineering Co., Ltd.) at 25&#176;C for 20 min, followed by incubation with a streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase complex for 20 min at 25&#176;C. Staining was visualized by incubating the tissue sections with 99% diaminobenzidine solution (Maixin Biological Technology Development Co.) at room temperature for 3&#8211;5 min, followed by counterstaining with hematoxylin and mounting with fluorescent mounting medium (DakoCytomation, Glostrup, Denmark). Immunostaining was semi-quantified using the Image-Pro Plus software, version 5 (Media Cybernetics, Inc., Rockville, MD, USA). Total cell numbers and the fluorescence intensity of each cell were counted and quantified in six separate fields (75&#8211;100 cells/field) for each of the conditions. The relative fluorescence intensity was calculated by dividing the total integrated optical density (IOD) by the total number of cells in each field. Mean fluorescence intensity measurements were. All sections were examined by a pathologist blinded to the grouping.\nElectron microscopy\nSNs were fixed in a solution containing 25% glutaric dialdehyde (Maixin Biological Technology Development Co.) and 1.5% paraformaldehyde (Nanjing Sen Beijia biotechnology Co., Ltd., Nanjing, China). Following fixation with 1% osmium tetroxide (Maixin Biological Technology Development Co.), and dehydration with ethanol and acetone, the SNs were embedded in epoxy resin 618 (Maixin Biological Technology Development Co.). Ultrathin sections were prepared with a LKB-5 Ultramicrotome (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Uppsala, Sweden), double-stained with uranyl acetate and calcium citrate (both Maixin Biological Technology Development Co.), and examined using an HU-12A Transmission Electron Microscope (Hitachi, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan).\nSemi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)\nTotal RNA was isolated from SN tissues (0.1 mg) using TRIzol&#174; reagent (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). RNA purity was determined by measuring the absorbance ratio at 260 and 280 nm (A260/A280) using a NanoVue UV spectrophotometer (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). cDNA was synthesized using the PrimeScript First Strand cDNA Synthesis kit (Takara Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Dalian, China) according to the manufacturer's protocol. PCR amplification was performed in a volume of 50 &#181;l containing 200 ng cDNA, 25 pmol/l of each primer, 0.25 mmol/l deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates, 5 &#181;l 10X buffer, 21.5 mmol/l MgCl and 2.0 U Taq HS polymerase (Takara Biotechnology Co., Ltd.). Primers for the PCR were as follows: TNF-&#945; forward, 5&#8242;-CAAACCACCAAGCAGAGGAGC-3&#8242; and reverse, 5&#8242;-CAAAGTGAGCTTGCCCGGACT-3&#8242;; TACE forward, 5&#8242;-CACTTTGGTGCCTTTCGTCC-3&#8242; and reverse, 5&#8242;-AGCTCGCCTCTTCGCTCGAC-3&#8242;; and &#946;-actin forward, 5&#8242;-ATCCGTAAAGACCTCTATGC-3&#8242; and reverse, 5&#8242;-AACGCAGCTCAGTAACAGTC-3&#8242; (BIO Asia Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China). PCR cycling conditions were as follows: An initial denaturation step at 94&#176;C for 3 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94&#176;C for 30 sec, 52/48&#176;C for 30 sec (TNF-&#945;/TACE), and 72&#176;C for 60 sec. The PCR products were subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis and the abundance of each mRNA was normalized against &#946;-actin using the Gel Doc 1000 UV Gel Imaging system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA).\nStatistical analysis\nSPSS software, version 10.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used to conduct statistical analyses. Data are presented as the mean &#177; standard deviation. Homogeneity of variance was evaluated using the Levene's test. In the case of homogeneity, one-way analysis of variance was conducted, followed by pair-wise between- and within-group comparisons using least significant difference (LSD) tests. In the case of heterogeneity, the Games-Howell test was used for analysis. P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.\nResults\n\nNone\n\nEffects of MK-801 pretreatment on I/R-induced iNOS activity in the SN\nThe SNs isolated from the sham-operated group exhibited low levels of iNOS activity (Table I). In the I/R group, the activity of iNOS was not significantly different to the sham group immediately following reperfusion (0 h time point; P>0.05); however, it gradually increased thereafter (P<0.05 at &#8805;6 h), and peaked at 24 h following reperfusion (P24 h post-reperfusion; however, it remained significantly different to the sham group at 7 days post-reperfusion (P<0.05; Table I). In the I/R+MK-801 group, the activity of iNOS followed the same temporal course as the I/R group; however, the activity was markedly lower at each time point, and the differences were significant at 12, 24, 72 h, and 7 days post-reperfusion, as compared with the I/R group (all P<0.05).\nEffects of MK-801 pretreatment on I/R-induced increases in plasma NO and MDA levels\nAs compared with the sham group, the I/R group exhibited elevated plasma levels of NO immediately following reperfusion, which peaked at 24 h post-reperfusion, and remained significantly elevated at 7 days post-reperfusion (P<0.05; Table I). The mean plasma levels of NO in the I/R+MK-801 group followed the same general trend; however, the plasma levels of NO were always lower in the I/R+MK-801 group, as compared with the I/R group, and were significantly lower at 6, 12, 24, 72 h, and 7 days post-reperfusion (P<0.05; Table I).Plasma concentrations of MDA were significantly elevated in the I/R group at all time points, as compared with the sham group (P<0.05; Table I). In addition, the I/R+MK-801 group exhibited lower mean plasma MDA levels at all time points, as compared with the I/R group, and were significantly different at 6, 12, 24 and 72 h post-reperfusion (all P<0.05; Table I).A temporal correlation between iNOS activity and levels of NO suggested that iNOS activity is the primary source of plasma NO, and lower plasma levels of MDA and NO in the I/R+MK-801 group, as compared with the I/R group, indicated that MK-801 may reduce MDA levels by reducing the concentration of plasma NO.\nEffects of MK-801 on I/R-induced histological changes in the SN\nSNs from the sham group exhibited no significant histological alterations after 5 h of ischemia, with only moderate swelling of endothelial cells and edema around the blood vessels (Fig. 1A). At 6 h post-reperfusion, neutrophils were adhered to the blood vessel walls and had infiltrated the surrounding endoneurium and epineurium (Fig. 1B). At 12 h post-reperfusion, further neutrophil adherence and infiltration was observed. In addition, the myelin sheathes were vesicular in appearance, and degranulation of neutrophils was detected. At 24 h post-reperfusion, the leakage of neutrophils out of blood vessels and infiltration into the SN reached a peak, and this was accompanied by detection of neutrophils around myelinated fibers, adherence of monocytes to vessels surrounding the endoneurium, and obvious edema and swelling of the endoneurium and myelin sheathes (Fig. 1C). At 72 h post-reperfusion, marked infiltration of monocytes was observed, macrophages were detected around Schwann cells and axon demyelination was observed. At 7 days post-reperfusion, numerous infiltrated macrophages and monocytes were detected, and this was accompanied by widespread demyelination and edema of the myelin sheathes, endoneurium and endothelial cells (Fig. 1D).No significant morphological alterations were observed in the SNs from rats in the I/R+MK-801 group immediately following reperfusion, and there was less edema, as compared with the I/R group. At 6 and 12 h post-reperfusion, fewer adherent and infiltrated neutrophils were observed, as compared with the I/R group (Fig. 1E). At 24 h post-reperfusion in the I/R+MK-801 group only mild inflammation was observed, with comparatively less edema and swelling of the endoneurium and myelin sheathes and no detectable demyelination (Fig. 1F). At 72 h and 7 days post-reperfusion, there remained fewer infiltrated monocytes surrounding Schwann cells and less demyelination, as compared with the I/R group (Fig. 1G).\nEffects of MK-801 on I/R-induced ultrastructural changes in the SN\nSNs isolated from the sham, I/R and I/R+MK-801 groups were also examined by TEM. Consistent with the histopathological observations, inflammatory cells were detected in the blood vessels and surrounding the epineurium of the SNs from the I/R group, which was accompanied by the adherence of neutrophils to the blood vessel walls and the leakage of neutrophils out of blood vessels. In addition, spaces between endothelial cells were broadened, which indicated a loss of blood vessel integrity (Fig. 2A). Certain neutrophils were observed to be distant from the blood vessel walls, and small numbers of lymphocytes were shown to surround detached collagen fibers. Furthermore, deformed erythrocytes were observed within various blood vessels, and signs of thrombosis and platelet aggregation, with concomitant narrowing or even complete blockage of blood vessels by fibrin and blood cells, was detected (Fig. 2B). Small numbers of infiltrating neutrophils and other inflammatory cells were detected around nerve bundles, and fissures of various sizes due to detached myelin were observed. In addition, swelling of various axons was observed and irregularly shaped effusion cavities were shown to have formed due to the separation of myelin sheathes from axons (Fig. 2C). Certain myelin sheathes showed signs of erosion, and various axons exhibited swollen mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Swollen mitochondria were also observed in the Schwann cells (Fig. 2D).I/R injury-induced ultrastructural changes appeared to be less severe in the SNs from the I/R+MK-801 group rats, which exhibited fewer infiltrating inflammatory cells, swollen mitochondria in axons and Schwann cells, and less severe ER swelling. In addition, no thrombosis, platelet aggregation, or clots were observed in the blood vessels of the SNs from the I/R+MK-801 group. Furthermore, there were no signs of demyelination, including fissures and effusion cavities, between axons and myelin sheathes (Fig. 2E).\nEffects of MK-801 on I/R-induced TNF-\u03b1 protein expression in the SN\nSNs isolated from the sham group exhibited no detectable expression of TNF-&#945; in the Schwann cells (Fig. 3A). At the initiation of reperfusion following 5-h ischemia, low protein expression levels of TNF-&#945; were detected in the Schwann cells. Concomitant with inflammatory cell accumulation at the vessel walls and infiltration at 6&#8211;12 h post-reperfusion, the protein expression levels of TNF-&#945; increased rapidly (Fig. 3B), and peaked at 24 h post-reperfusion (Fig. 3C). At 72 h post-reperfusion, the migration of neutrophils had ceased, macrophages had infiltrated and were surrounding the Schwann cells, demyelination was detected, and the protein expression levels of TNF-&#945; were gradually returned to baseline levels (Fig. 3D). At 7 days post-reperfusion, widespread general demyelination was detected and the protein expression levels of TNF-&#945; had remained 2-fold higher, as compared with baseline levels (Fig. 3E).MK-801 pre-treatment markedly reduced the protein expression levels of TNF-&#945; during reperfusion (Fig. 3F&#8211;H), as demonstrated by a reduction in the number of cells positive for TNF-&#945; and the intensity of staining. IOD measurements demonstrated that the protein expression levels TNF-&#945; were significantly reduced at 12 and 24 h post-reperfusion, as compared with the I/R group (Fig. 4).\nEffect of MK-801 on I/R-induced mRNA expression of TNF-\u03b1 and TACE in the SN\nFollowing 5 h of ischemia, the mRNA expression levels of TNF-&#945; in the SNs from the I/R group rats were not significantly different, as compared with the sham group (P>0.05). However, reperfusion significantly increased the mRNA expression levels of TNF-&#945;, which peaked at 24 h post-reperfusion, prior to decreasing to a level ~2-fold above the baseline at 7 days post-reperfusion (Fig. 5A&#8211;G). Similarly, the mRNA expression levels of TACE were increased during reperfusion, and peaked at 12 h post-reperfusion, prior to returning to the baseline at 7 days post-reperfusion (Fig. 5A&#8211;F and H). Pretreatment with MK-801 markedly reduced the mRNA expression levels of TNF-&#945; and TACE throughout the reperfusion period, with significant differences at 12&#8211;72 h post-reperfusion (P<0.05).\nDiscussion\nGlutamate neurotoxicity (excitotoxicity) is a seminal upstream event in the pathogenesis of I/R-induced neuronal injury in the CNS (6). NMDAR is a major contributor to this process, since it is the predominant calcium-permeable glutamate receptor isoform and thus the major link between the accumulation of extracellular glutamate from dysregulated synaptic release and reverse transport (34&#8211;37), and intracellular neurodegenerative pathways triggered by intracellular calcium elevation, including proteolytic and free radical damage (5,6,38). The results of the present study suggested that NMDAR stimulation may be a critical early trigger of I/R-induced neuronal injury in the PNS. Notably, MK-801 pre-treatment was able to inhibit numerous neurodegenerative downstream pathways in the SN, including edema, cell swelling, mitochondrial damage, immune cell infiltration and demyelination. Activation of TNF-&#945;, TACE, and iNOS, which are mediators of nerve inflammation and oxidative stress, may be a key NMDAR-dependent intermediate step in this process, as rescue from I/R-induced injury was associated with reduced iNOS, TNF-&#945;, and TACE expression levels, as well as decreased accumulation of MDA, which is an indicator of oxidative stress.The tissue microenvironment surrounding peripheral nerves is distinct from the white matter of the CNS; thus major differences in the underlying pathogenesis of I/R-induced nerve injury in the CNS and the PNS may be expected. For example, the source of the excitotoxic glutamate (synaptic vs. non-synaptic), the role of the supporting cells (astrocytes vs. Schwann cells), the immunoresponse, and the neuroprotective and cytotoxic intermediates are distinct (39). However, the rat SN exhibited a similar sequence of pathogenic processes following I/R, as compared with the CNS, including early edema and cell swelling, followed by delayed inflammation, axonal degeneration and demyelination. Notably, these processes were blocked or reduced in severity by MK-801 pre-treatment; thus suggesting that early NMDAR activation may be involved in the events leading to I/R injury (40,41).In a previous study, peripheral application of MK-801 was shown to prevent peripheral nerve damage (30), whereas activation of peripheral glutamate receptors was shown to induce peripheral nerve damage or dysfunction (30). For example, the thermogenic flare induced by subdermal injection of the bee venom toxin was associated with local extracellular glutamate accumulation and was attenuated by co-injection with MK-801 (12); thus suggesting a role for local NMDARs on sensory afferents as opposed to spinal NMDARs. Similarly, peripheral glutamate released by damaged tissues and reverse transport or glutamate influx from damaged capillaries, may have induced SN damage during and following ischemia (37). Sodium influx upon NMDAR activation may lead to axonal swelling by osmotic water movement, consistent with the observed relief by MK-801 (42). Calcium influx associated with NMDAR activation and ischemic-depolarization may initiate a chain of biochemical events leading to axonal damage, including calcium-dependent calcium release (43). At least within central axons, a form of excitation-calcium coupling analogous to that in muscle cells may exist, which induces calcium release from ryanodine-sensitive stores (5,44). In addition, the ER is a major calcium store (45), and the ultrastructural investigations conducted in the present study detected signs of axonal ER damage, possibly resulting in calcium egress. In turn, dysregulated calcium may activate proteases that damage the axonal cytoskeleton, resulting in disruption of axonal transport with concomitant inhibition of retrograde growth factor signaling (46). These same processes may also be triggered at the proximal end of the nerve (closer to the spinal cord), since glutamate within the dorsal root ganglia was enhanced by SN injury, and cells within the dorsal root ganglia responded to direct application of various glutamate receptor agonists, including NMDA (13).NO may relieve or exacerbate ischemic neural injury, depending on context (47). As a vasorelaxant, NO synthesized by neuronal NOS and iNOS may rescue tissue by promoting reperfusion (48). Notably, ischemic preconditioning involves iNOS induction (49). Conversely, in previous studies, silencing iNOS exerted neuroprotective effects against neurodegenerative diseases by reducing microglial activation (50) and/or oxidative stress (51). The present study demonstrated a temporal correlation between iNOS activation and lipid peroxidation during reperfusion; thus suggesting that iNOS was a major source of free radicals in the reperfused SN axons.Comparable to NO, TNF-&#945; may exert protective and deleterious effects during ischemia (52,53), with low levels mediating preconditioning, possibly by enhancing the sensitivity of neurons to growth factors. However, TNF-&#945; is a central inflammatory mediator and higher concentrations have previously been shown to be deleterious (26). In the present study, the reduction of TNF-&#945; levels by blocking NMDA receptors and reducing the expression levels of TACE markedly suppressed the neuroinflammatory response, leading to maintenance of the integrity of blood vessels, axonal myelination, mitochondria, ER and Schwann cells during reperfusion.The present study included a number of limitations. First, the clamping of the femoral artery induced I/R in the entire limb; although only the SN was sampled and examined, the effects of I/R on the entire limb may have affected the present results. Second, the H&E sections and electron microscopy examinations were analyzed subjectively. Third, the experimental approach did not allow the determination of exact cause-to-effect relationships, nor clarify the specific mechanisms underlying peripheral nerve I/R injury. Furthermore, the lack of homology between rodent and human anatomy, physiology and response to injury and inflammation may limit the relevance of the results of the present study to humans. Further studies are required in order to address these issues and to improve the current understanding of peripheral nerve I/R injury.In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that systemic injection of the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 was able to protect the rat SN against I/R injury, including attenuating immune cell infiltration and demyelination, possibly by inhibiting the activation of TNF-&#945; and reducing the expression levels of iNOS in the SN.", "pmid": "27168774", "title": "Inhibition of the NMDA receptor protects the rat sciatic nerve against ischemia/reperfusion injury", "journal_title": "Experimental and Therapeutic Medicine", "authors": "TIE KE;RENBIN LI;WENCHANG CHEN", "doi": "10.3892/etm.2016.3148", "score": "0.013773095"}, {"keywords": "Descemet\u2019s stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty;Descemet\u2019s membrane endothelial keratoplasty;Intraoperative OCT;RESCAN 700", "abstract": "Background\nTo report the feasibility of intraoperative spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) using the RESCAN 700 for the visualization and evaluation of precut Descemet&#8217;s stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK) and prestripped Descemet&#8217;s membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK) donor tissue.Methods\nPrecut DSAEK (n&#8201;=&#8201;11), prestripped DMEK (n&#8201;=&#8201;4) preserved in a viewing chamber were examined by intraoperative OCT.

Recent statistics showed that these techniques are the most common keratoplasty procedures performed in the U.S. [18]. The use of precut DSAEK tissue [19] or prestripped DMEK tissue [20] supplied by the eyebank has greatly shortened the operation time, avoids a large capital investment in an expensive microkeratome machine for DSAEK and avoids tissue loss due to unsuccessful Descemet&#8217;s membrane stripping/harvesting in DMEK. Evaluation of these premade endothelial keratoplasty tissues before surgery can be successfully and effectively performed by slit lamp biomicroscopy and specular microscopy. However, it is difficult to precisely evaluate the depth and quality of the lamellar cut or prestripped status by these modalities.Previously, anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) has proven useful to screen donor corneas for previous refractive surgeries such as laser in situ keratomileusis [21, 22]. Recently, some eyebanks have adopted AS-OCT as their standard procedures for tissue evaluation [23].Herein, we show the feasibilities of intraoperative spectral domain OCT using the RESCAN 700 (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Germany) [24, 25] for the rapid visualization and rough evaluation of precut DSAEK and prestripped DMEK donor tissue.\nMethods\nThe study was approved by the Ethical Committee of Kanazawa University Graduate School of Medical Science and followed the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. Internationally shipped precut DSAEK (n&#8201;=&#8201;11) and prestripped DMEK (n&#8201;=&#8201;4) donor corneas from a US eyebank (SightLife&#8482;, Seattle, USA) preserved in a viewing chamber were used. For a control, domestic wholly intact donor corneas taken post-mortem for penetrating keratoplasty (PK) (n&#8201;=&#8201;8) were used. Consent was received for the use of these corneas for this research by the donors&#8217; next of kin. The donor cornea for DSAEK was dissected with a microkeratome (ALTK Cbm; Moria, France) equipped with a 300&#160;&#956;m head at the US eyebank. The DMEK donor graft was also prepared at the US eyebank using the submerged cornea using the backgrounds away (SCUBA) technique [15]. All donor tissues (PK tissue, precut DSAEK tissue, pre-stripped DMEK tissue) were kept in Optisol GS solution (Bausch & Lomb Surgical, USA) and internationally shipped by airplane at 4&#176; Celsius. After warming the donor tissues, they were subjected to routine slit lamp biomicroscopy and intraoperative SD-OCT without taking them out of the preservation medium and container.\nIntraoperative OCT\nThe Rescan 700 is a real-time intraoperative spectral domain OCT integrated into the OPMI Lumera 700 microscope (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Germany). The Rescan 700 scan rate was 27,000 axial scans per second. The axial and transverse resolution in tissue are 5 &#956;m and 15 &#956;m, respectively. Each donor tissue was scanned through the transparent window of the corneal viewing chamber, which was placed on a flat table. The OCT images are recorded in a horizontal and vertical orientation. The scan depth was 2&#160;mm and the scan length was adjusted to each donor cornea tissue between 9 and 11&#160;mm (adjustable between 3&#8211;16&#160;mm). The surgeon observed the live, uninterrupted intraoperative OCT images during surgery through a small window adjacent to the operating field. Acquired images were evaluated qualitatively for the shape and reflectivity of the donor cornea tissue.\nResults\nFor each type of donor (PK, DSAEK, DMEK donor), characteristic images were consistently and easily obtained by intraoperative OCT in both the front and back views through the viewing chamber.In wholly intact PK donors, appearance of normal corneal curvature, although not quantitatively measured, and normal stromal texture with high reflectivity of the epithelium and endothelium cell layers were clearly visualized in all donors (n&#8201;=&#8201;8) (Fig.&#160;1).Fig. 1Intraoperative spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) image of a donor cornea for penetrating keratoplasty observed through a viewing chamber. a Representative microscope image (surgeon&#8217;s view) observed from the anterior (left). Normal corneal curvature and stromal texture with high reflectivity of epithelium and endothelium cell layers were observed by intraoperative OCT (right). b Microscopic image observed from the posterior cornea (left) and intraoperative OCT image (right)In precut DSAEK donors, precut lines were characteristically visualized rapidly in addition to the PK donor cornea images (Fig.&#160;2). Some precut DSEAK donors showed epithelial defect and/or debris on the surface of endothelium; however, these changes usually do not have any clinical significance.Fig. 2Intraoperative SD-OCT image of a donor cornea for precut Descemet&#8217;s stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK) observed through a viewing chamber. a Representative microscope image (surgeon&#8217;s view) observed from the anterior (left).

Characteristic microkeratome cut line (arrows) together with debris (arrowheads) observed on the endothelium cell surface was observed (left)In prestripped DMEK donors, no characteristic images were noted by SD-OCT when observed from the anterior surface, since peripheral image could not be obtained from the anterior surface observation. However, peripheral partial detachments of Descemet&#8217;s membrane were characteristically observed in all prestripped DMEK donors when viewed only from the back of the viewing chamber (Fig.&#160;3). Debris on the surface of endothelium was also seen in some donors.Fig. 3Intraoperative SD-OCT image of a donor cornea for prestripped Descemet&#8217;s membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK) observed through a viewing chamber. a Representative microscope image (surgeon&#8217;s view) observed from the anterior (left).

Characteristic peripheral partial detachment of Descemetcpes membrane was also noted (arrows)All donor corneas were transplanted (8 PK, 11 DSAEK, 4 DMEK) to patients, and all corneas remain transparent for at least 12&#160;months.\nDiscussion\nThe microscope integrated intraoperative OCT is a relatively new technology. It enables in vivo 3-D visualization of the steps of retina [26&#8211;28] and cornea [29&#8211;34] surgeries. The RESCAN 700 is the first commercially available intraoperative OCT system combining a surgical microscope (OPMI LUMERA 700, Carl Zeiss Meditec, Germany) and a spectral domain OCT having a wavelength of 840&#160;nm and a scanning speed of 27,000 A-scans per second. The surgeon does not need to look up from the microscope to see the OCT data since the RESCAN 700 allows the surgeon to simultaneously see the surgical field in both a planar view using the surgical microscope and a cross-sectional view by OCT. Most importantly, images are viewed in real time. The OCT system can be controlled from the microscope&#8217;s foot pedal so the surgeon can take videos, snapshots and 3-D OCT images without looking up or stopping the surgery. The usefulness of the RESCAN 700 has been reported for anterior segment surgeries (corneal incisions, scleral closure phacoemulsification groove depth and intraocular lens position) [24], riboflavin penetration in collagen crosslinking [25] and retinal surgeries (evaluation of hyaloid release with triamcinolone and completeness of peel in macular hole and epiretinal membrane) [24]. Recently, we have also confirmed its clinical usefulness in DSAEK for detecting residual fluid between the donor and host cornea which enables a surgeon to decide the appropriate timing to stop corneal massage and push out the residual interface fluid. Also, it is quite useful in DMEK for preventing upside-down DMEK donors in the anterior chamber (data not shown).Herein, we report the feasibilities of the visualization of donor corneas for PK, precut DSAEK and pre-stripped DMEK by intraoperative OCT using the RESCAN 700. As a result, we showed characteristic images for each type of donor. In wholly intact PK donors, appearance of normal corneal curvature and stromal texture with high reflectivity of the epithelium and endothelium cell layers were clearly visualized. However, the precise corneal curvature could not be measured by RESCAN 700. The images were consistent with those obtained by conventional AS-OCT. In precut DSAEK donors, precut lines were characteristically visualized and the results were also in accordance with those observed by conventional AS-OCT. In prestripped DMEK donors, identical OCT images as the PK donor cornea were noted when observed from the anterior surface. However, peripheral partial detachments of Descemet&#8217;s membrane were characteristically observed in all prestripped DMEK donors when viewed from the back of the viewing chamber. Although the peripheral detachment in DMEK donors are quite common and clinically non-problematic in DMEK donor quality and subsequent DMEK surgeries, it may be useful to distinguish between wholly intact PK donors and prestripped DMEK donors by detecting the peripheral detachment sign; it may be difficult or impossible to check the subtle Descemt&#8217;s membrane change using slit lamp examination alone.AS-OCT has been used as a routine procedure for tissue evaluation in some advanced eyebanks to detect previous refractive surgeries and corneal scarring [23]. On the other hand, most eyebanks do not have their own AS-OCT system yet in Japan. Therefore, intraoperative OCT may be used as an alternative device of AS-OCT; it may be able to detect not only corneal donor status, but also corneal scars and previous refractive surgeries just like AS-OCT equipped in eyebank. Another potential usefulness of this device is to routinely check the donor status just before surgery by surgeon to prevent mix-ups of donors, especially when several different types of keratoplasties are scheduled in a same day in one operating theater.One drawback of this study is that quantitative analysis of the donor status is lacking; the quantitative information such as donor thickness or curvature will definitely strengthen this paper. However, RESCAN 700 currently does not have any quantitative capacity. Development of new software in RESCAN 700 that enables quantitative analysis will enhance the capacity of the device.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, rapid visualization and rough evaluation of donor tissues for PK, precut DSAEK and prestripped DMEK donor corneas by intraoperative OCT was consistently possible through the viewing chamber. Although clinically acceptable, peripheral detachment of Descemet&#8217;s membrane of prestripped DMEK donors was successfully and characteristically observed by intraoperative OCT. It may be possible to prevent mix-ups of donors by checking those donors just before surgery by surgeon especially several different types of keratoplasties are scheduled in a same day in one operating theater.", "pmid": "27491407", "title": "Visualization of precut DSAEK and pre-stripped DMEK donor corneas by intraoperative optical coherence tomography using the RESCAN 700", "journal_title": "BMC Ophthalmology", "authors": "Akira Kobayashi;Hideaki Yokogawa;Natsuko Mori;Kazuhisa Sugiyama", "doi": "10.1186/s12886-016-0308-z", "score": "0.012804478"}, {"keywords": "", "abstract": "Background\nMicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA molecules that repress the translation of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) or degrade mRNAs. These functions of miRNAs allow them to control key cellular processes such as development, differentiation and apoptosis, and they have also been implicated in several cancers such as leukaemia, lung, pancreatic and ovarian cancer (OC). Unfortunately, the specific machinery of miRNA regulation, involving transcription factors (TFs) and transcription co-factors (TcoFs), is not well understood. In the present study we focus on computationally deciphering the underlying network of miRNAs, their targets, and their control mechanisms that have an influence on OC development.Results\nWe analysed experimentally verified data from multiple sources that describe miRNA influence on diseases, miRNA targeting of mRNAs, and on protein-protein interactions, and combined this data with ab initio transcription factor binding site predictions within miRNA promoter regions. From these analyses, we derived a network that describes the influence of miRNAs and their regulation in human OC. We developed a methodology to analyse the network in order to find the nodes that have the largest potential of influencing the network's behaviour (network hubs). We further show the potentially most influential miRNAs, TFs and TcoFs, showing subnetworks illustrating the involved mechanisms as well as regulatory miRNA network motifs in OC. We find an enrichment of miRNA targeted OC genes in the highly relevant pathways cell cycle regulation and apoptosis.Conclusions\nWe combined several sources of interaction and association data to analyse and place miRNAs within regulatory pathways that influence human OC. These results represent the first comprehensive miRNA regulatory network analysis for human OC. This suggests that miRNAs and their regulation may play a major role in OC and that further directed research in this area is of utmost importance to enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying human cancer development and OC in particular.", "body": "Background\nMicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short (~22 nucleotides) non-coding RNA molecules, which influence gene expression mainly through degradation of coding mRNA [1,2]. Similar to protein coding genes, miRNA genes (pri-miRNAs) thus far identified are predominantly transcribed by RNA polymerase II [3,4]. New evidence, however, also indicates the involvement of RNA polymerase III for certain miRNAs [5,6]. These findings suggest that pri-miRNAs are regulated on the transcriptional level in a similar fashion as protein coding genes. Following transcription, pri-miRNAs are cleaved through the microprocessor complex Drosha and DGCR8 to generate 60~70nt pre-miRNAs [7,8]. Exportin-5 and its co-factor RanGTP then export the pre-miRNAs into the cytoplasm [9], where they are cleaved by Dicer, an RNase III endonuclease, to yield the mature miRNAs [2,10].A wide range of mRNAs are targeted by miRNAs. Numerous databases [11-15], such as the TarBase database [16] and miRTarBase [17], hold experimentally validated or computationally predicted miRNA targets. Consequently, recent experimental and computational studies focus on the regulatory regions or transcription start sites (TSSs) of miRNA genes [18-22], their associated transcription factors (TFs) [23-25], and their effects on miRNA transcription [23]. Nevertheless, the signals and mechanisms that govern miRNA transcriptional regulation remain unclear.Interest in miRNAs and their control is governed by the knowledge that a multitude of miRNAs are implicated in a variety of human diseases [26-28], including several human cancers [29,30]. Recent studies and reviews focused on miRNA involvement in the progression of the most serious gynaecological cancer, ovarian cancer (OC), and it is now commonly accepted that miRNAs play a role in OC [31-34]. Experimental data shows that several miRNAs exhibit altered expression levels in OC cell lines [35-37]. Nevertheless, knowledge about possible miRNA regulatory roles within OC initiation and progression is incomplete. The transcriptional regulation of the pri-miRNAs involved in OC is an important process which, if understood, could positively impact current treatments and survival rates of patients with OC.In the present study, we investigated the underlying network of miRNAs, their targets, and their control mechanisms that are associated with OC development. Changes in miRNA networks between cancerous and healthy tissue have recently been illuminated [38]. Here we concentrate on miRNAs and their regulation in OC. We considered all human miRNAs that are listed in miRBase [15]. For this set of miRNAs, we extracted experimentally verified targets from TarBase [16] and miRTarBase [17] and selected those that have been associated with OC in accordance with the Dragon Database for Exploration of Ovarian Cancer Genes (DDOC, [39]). In addition, we mapped transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) onto extracted promoter regions of the human miRNAs from miRBase to establish a link between TFs and miRNAs. We considered two different sizes of promoter regions, 1000nt and 5000nt upstream of the miRNA gene body. In addition, we incorporated human curated protein-protein interaction (PPI) data from several interaction databases [40-44] to identify other proteins that may partake indirectly in the regulation of the miRNAs and to establish links between all participating proteins in the network.From these considerations, we derived two large networks (one for each considered promoter size) of interacting biological entities (nodes) that are centred on the miRNAs and that impact OC. We combined miRNAs, their downstream targets, and their upstream regulatory proteins in these networks in order to place these entities in the context of OC. Subsequently, we devised a methodology to assign a rank to each node according to its potential for influencing the network's behaviour. This rank is based on the number of potential interaction partners that a network node might have as well as the type of interaction a node engages in. Finally we identified regulatory network motifs in the networks. We defined regulatory network motifs to be the smallest possible group of nodes in the network that form a closed circle of interactions with each other. We propose that these network motifs are integral constituent parts of the network and the main stepping-stones that can be used to further an understanding of the networks behaviour, as well as potential targets for possible attempts to interfere with the network's behaviour.The results of this network analysis show that miRNAs and their regulation play an important role within OC and further in-depth research in this direction may be rewarding.\nResults and discussion\n\nMicroRNAs and their targets involved in OC\nThe focus of our study is to contribute to the current knowledge of human miRNA involvement in OC. As a starting point we used all human miRNAs that are listed in miRBase [15]. For these we extracted all experimentally confirmed miRNA targets from TarBase [16] and miRTarBase [17] and subsequently restricted our analysis to those miRNAs that have an experimentally confirmed target that is involved in the progression of OC according to the DDOC database [39]. In total we extracted 162 miRNAs targeting 131 different human proteins. DDOC lists a total of 379 genes that are relevant for the progression of OC. This means that more than one third of the OC genes indentified so far are experimentally confirmed targets of miRNAs. TarBase and miRTarBase together list no more than 1800 human genes as confirmed targets of miRNAs. This means that miRNA targets are overrepresented among OC genes with regard to all human genes. While an explanation for this observation remains elusive, it merits a closer examination of the role of miRNAs and their regulation in OC.Research by Laios et al. [45] suggests that various miRNAs are involved in different stages of cancer progression. Among the OC-relevant proteins that are experimentally proven to be targeted by these miRNAs are several proteins that are key members of important cancer pathways. Two examples are that miR-214 induces cell survival and cisplatin resistance through targeting the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of PTEN, which leads to down-regulation of PTEN and the activation of the Akt pathway [37]. PTEN is also targeted by 13 other miRNAs. Furthermore, miR-15b and miR-16 inhibit BCL2 expression thereby initiating cleavage of pro-caspase 9 and PARP and consequently leading to apoptosis [46]. BCL2 is targeted by a total of 23 miRNAs.\nMicroRNAs and their regulatory proteins\nTo increase our understanding of how the 162 miRNAs identified above are regulated on the transcriptional level, we extracted the promoter region sequences of the miRNA genes that correspond to the 162 miRNAs identified above from the UCSC database [47]. Two different promoter lengths of 1000nt and 5000nt upstream of the reported miRNA gene were extracted thereby ensuring that one component of our analysis focuses on the transcriptional elements in the core promoter while the other considers a more comprehensive set of cis-regulatory elements operating at greater distance. Differences in the resulting networks will aid in highlighting the interactions of regulatory proteins with regulatory motifs that are primarily located in the core promoter as well as regulatory processes that include more distally located regulatory sequence motifs. To do this, we mapped BIOBASE TRANSFAC binding site motifs to the promoter regions [48] and linked TFs to the mapped TFBSs (see Methods). We additionally extracted high-confidence transcription co-factors (TcoFs) that interact with these TFs from TcoF-DB [49]. We found that 237 TFs and 140 high-confidence TcoFs may be involved in the core regulation (1000nt upstream) of the 162 OC-associated miRNAs. When examining the larger and potentially more comprehensive set of TFBS (5000nt upstream of the miRNA genes), 244 TFs were predicted to bind to the extended promoter regions of OC-associated miRNAs. The seven additionally considered TFs (GATA6, LHX3, MTF1, NFIL3, NKX31, ZBTB6, ZN350) only have predicted binding sites that are more distally located from the TSS and do not interact with any new high-confidence TcoFs.\nNetwork construction\nTo generate a network, we extracted from PPI data (see Methods) all interactions for the targets of all 162 OC-associated miRNAs, relevant TFs, and TcoFs. After we combined all the interactions we derived two networks of interest, one for core promoter regulatory elements (NW1000) and one for the more comprehensive set of regulatory elements (NW5000). Table 1 shows the numbers of various types of nodes and numbers of interactions (edges) in the two networks. The complete networks can be found in the Additional Files 1 and 2. Including PPIs, transcriptional regulation and miRNA targeting the role of miRNAs in OC is seen as a complex and highly interconnected network.\nNetwork hubs\nTo identify those components of the networks that have the most potential to influence to networks' overall behaviour, we implemented an edge-based ranking system. Each node is ranked according to a score based on its outgoing edges of the first and second degree (see Methods). However, there are three different types of edges within the network, two directed edge types, namely miRNA to target association, and TF to miRNA association, and an undirected edge of the type PPI. The latter is assumed to have the least influence on the information flow within the network. We assume that the most important edge in the network et is the interface between a miRNA and its target, because this is a directed edge that has been experimentally proven. The second most important edge er is an association between a TF and a miRNA, even though only predicted, has a direction. The least important edge ei is the undirected interaction between two proteins.This means that each node in the network is ranked based on the number of potential binding partners as well as on the type of molecular interaction that it engages in. Our networks thus constitute a model that attempts to describe mechanisms in the living cell in the form of a weighted directed graph. Other aspects of a living cell, such as expression levels of the genes involved or the current developmental stage of the cell, are not part of our model.Applying our weighting algorithm (see Methods) to the two networks NW1000 and NW5000 generated a ranking for each node. The complete node ranking for all nodes in NW1000 and NW5000 can be found in the Additional Files 3 and 4. Here we highlight nodes that were ranked high in both networks. We interpret these nodes as network hubs, potentially having the greatest influence on the regulation of miRNAs involved in OC.It is known that elements located far upstream from a gene can contribute to its regulation [50,51]. However, when sizing a gene's upstream region to study its promoter region one has to more or less arbitrarily set a length limit. Any sequence length chosen is always a trade-off between excluding elements further upstream that might be relevant (shorter length) and including them alongside irrelevant DNA in the analysis introducing noise (longer length). While aware of these unavoidable shortcomings, we included two lengths that are frequently chosen as a compromise.TFs that are ranked more highly in NW1000 can be understood to have a higher concentration of binding sites close to the start of the miRNA genes, while those that are ranked higher in NW5000 can be interpreted as having a tendency to bind more distally from the gene body. Naturally, the TFs appearing in NW1000 are a subset of those appearing in NW5000, but the TFs that are exclusively in NW5000 can be understood to bind to more remote binding sites. Seven such TFs were identified (see above).There is an overlap of six TFs between the nodes ranked 1st to 10th in both networks (BRCA1, SP1, ESR1, SMAD3, PO2F1, TFE2) and therefore we regard these six TFs as the essential regulatory elements for miRNA regulation in human OC. Together they are predicted to regulate 148 out of 162 miRNAs in NW1000, which in turn target 130 out of 131 experimentally validated miRNA target proteins. In NW5000, these six TFs participate in the regulation of all 162 OC relevant miRNAs. This means that when an upstream regulatory region of 5000nt is considered, these six TFs are predicted to participate in the regulation of all OC relevant miRNA genes and with that have a potential influence on the expression levels of all OC relevant genes whose mRNAs are targeted by a miRNA. To the best of our knowledge, BRCA1, SP1, TFE2, PO2F1 and ESR1 have not been experimentally validated as TFs of the identified OC relevant miRNAs. It has been demonstrated that ESR1 mediated a decrease in hsa-mir-21 expression correlated with increased protein expression of endogenous hsa-mir-21 targets such as PDCD4, PTEN, and BCL2 [52]. It has however not been validated that ESR1 mediated this process as a TF of hsa-mir-21 and no binding site for ESR1 is predicted in the hsa-mir-21 promoter region using our method. SMAD3 has been shown to bind and transcribe the hsa-mir-24 promoter during myoblast differentiation [53]. Also, SMAD3 has been implicated in other diseases by acting as a TF for other miRNAs, for example: SMAD3 drives hsa-mir-192 expression thereby mediating renal fibrosis [54] and SMAD3 has been shown to bind the let-7d promoter thereby promoting idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [55].The highest ranking miRNAs according to our algorithm are hsa-mir-20a, hsa-mir-24-2, hsa-mir-34a, hsa-mir-21, hsa-mir-17 and hsa-mir-155. This is the first time that hsa-mir-155 has been linked to the progression of OC. However, recent research is focused on designing hsa-mir-155 based therapies as it has been demonstrated that a moderate increase in hsa-mir-155 levels is observed in many types of malignancies, and transgenic over-expression of the miRNA in mice results in cancer, whilst high levels of hsa-mir-155 expressed during immune response and hematopoietic lineage differentiation does not harm the organism [56]. It has recently been shown that hsa-miR-20a is differentially expressed in female oocytes [57]. In our networks hsa-mir-20a targets a total of nine genes that are implicated in the progression of OC. miR-24 has been found to regulate apoptosis in cancer cells and has already been suggested as a drug target for cancer therapy [58]. For graphical illustration, Figure 1 shows a large, highly connected subnetwork of NW1000 illuminating the interactions of six highly relevant TFs with six highly ranked miRNAs and their 38 OC relevant targets. For simplicity the TcoFs that interact with the TFs shown are omitted.Among the TcoFs in the networks EP300, RB, UBC9, HDAC1, MED1, CTNB1, HDAC2, PML and NCOA6 are ranked high and therefore have a high potential of being more influential with regard to the networks' overall behaviour than others. These nine TcoFs appear in the list of best-ranked TcoFs of both networks NW1000 and NW5000. The human protein EP300 is the highest ranked TcoF in both networks, NW1000 and NW5000. It interacts with 51 TFs who in turn regulate all but five (all miRNAs in NW5000) OC-relevant miRNAs in NW1000.Figure 2 shows a heatmap illustrating a sub-network of NW1000 concentrating on the TF BRCA1. This node can be regarded as the most significant node for OC relevant miRNA regulation. It is ranked 1st in both networks NW1000 and NW5000. This TF regulates 50 miRNAs in NW1000 (124 in NW5000), which target 66 (115 in NW5000) proteins involved in OC. The left hand side of Figure 2 shows all miRNAs that BRCA1 is predicted to regulate. Across the top all genes are listed that are reported to be targeted by those miRNAs. The hierarchical clustering shown here groups miRNAs and proteins together that display a similar behaviour. The Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1 (CDN1A) for example is targeted by 13 different miRNAs.\nMicroRNA regulatory network motifs\nTo better illustrate the cooperation of various nodes in the network we endeavoured to identify network motifs shared by both NW1000 and NW5000 networks. We thus searched for loop-like structures that potentially can be self-promoting, thus contributing to changed expression levels of genes and miRNAs during OC progression. Initially we found five miRNAs in NW1000 (22 in NW5000) that target one of their own predicted TFs.Next we identified three-element network motifs, which feature one miRNA and two proteins. In this structure, one of the proteins acts as a TF by regulating the miRNA, which in turn targets the other protein. The latter either simply interacts with the TF or serves as a TcoF for the regulation of the miRNA. This protein will also be associated with OC according to DDOC [39]. Depending on the observed expression levels of the miRNA in OC, the levels of the protein target would increase or decrease and depending on the type of interaction between the two proteins and depending on the type of TF (activator or repressor), this type of loop structure would either be self-propagating (positive feedback loop) or self-cancelling (negative feedback loop). Figure 3 summarises the structure under consideration. NW1000 possesses 232 different loops of this type, while NW5000 possesses 752 different loops. The full list of loop structures can be found in the Additional Files 5 and 6. In NW1000 (NW5000), a total of 67 (98) TFs, 80 (122) miRNAs and 46 (60) genes relevant for OC progression are involved in these feedback loops.One interesting protein is the known proto-oncogene MYC that is found up-regulated in many cancers [59]. It has recently been suggested that miRNAs that are regulated by MYC should be targeted as a possible therapeutic strategy [60]. In our network (NW1000) MYC is targeted by 14 different miRNAs and is predicted to regulate 43 miRNAs. According to our analysis MYC is targeted by three miRNAs, which are also predicted to be regulated by MYC. In addition MYC is part of 33 feedback loops. Out of the 46 OC relevant gene targets that are involved in feedback loop structures, a significant majority (31 genes) are involved in the cell cycle regulation pathway. This pathway is highly relevant for cancer development. While in general the enrichment of genes relevant to OC in the cell cycle pathway is quite high (125 out of 379 genes are involved), the enrichment among genes targeted by miRNAs and part of feedback loops is significantly higher. This means that the expression levels of miRNAs in OC could have a significant impact on the cell cycle. For example, the TP53 protein acts as a cell cycle inhibitor. This protein is targeted by six miRNA and is involved in 17 feedback loops of the type described above. Another protein that is involved in the cell cycle regulation pathway is BRCA1 [61]. This protein is involved in 37 possible feedback loops either as a predicted regulator of miRNAs or as a confirmed miRNA target. For other types of cancer it has been shown that changed miRNA expression levels have the potential to affect relevant pathways and to influence disease development [62]. Our analysis shows that miRNAs and their expression potentially play a major role in OC progression through influencing the cell cycle pathway. Another pathway that is highly relevant for the progression of every cancer is apoptosis. We find five OC relevant genes to be involved in this pathway that are also targeted by miRNAs and part of regulatory feedback loops. This points to another potential mechanism, by which miRNAs and their regulation can possibly affect OC development and progression.\nConclusions\nWe have established two networks of miRNA in human OC, one network that investigates core promoter elements and one that investigates a more comprehensive set of cis-regulatory elements of miRNA regulation. An examination of these networks with a ranking algorithm and a search for loop-structured network motifs reveals some key players in the regulation of miRNA in human OC. Key miRNAs in the progression of OC appear to be hsa-mir-20a, hsa-mir-24-2, hsa-mir-34a, hsa-mir-21, hsa-mir-17 and hsa-mir-hsa-mir-155 while key TFs are BRCA1, SP1, ESR1, SMAD3, PO2F1 and TFE2 among others.\nMethods\n\nmiRNAs\nWe considered all human miRNAs that are listed in miRBase [15] and have a confirmed target in DDOC [39].\nMicroRNA targets\nWe extracted targets for miRNAs from the databases for experimentally verified miRNA targets TarBase [16] and miRTarBase [17]. We only used targets of miRNAs that appeared in DDOC [39].\nProtein-protein interactions\nHuman PPI were extracted from the following five databases: IntAct [40], BioGRID [41], HPRD [42], Reactome [43], and MINT [44].\nTFs and TcoFs for miRNAs\nProximal promoter sequences (1000bp upstream) and more comprehensive promoter sequences (5000bp upstream) were downloaded from the UCSC Genome browser [47] for the miRNAs. We used binding site models from Biobase Knowledge Library (BKL) [48] to map mammalian TFBSs to the promoter sequences. We only used those TFBSs that are mapped with a core- and matrix score of greater than or equal to 0.9. TFs that were used to create the binding motifs were associated to the TFBS and thus the link TF&#8594; miRNA was created. TcoFs are proteins that interact with TFs. Either they are TFs themselves that do not regulate a miRNA or they are proteins that are not themselves binding to the DNA but are known to interact with a TF and are annotated as participating in transcriptional regulation. We extracted TcoFs from TcoF-DB [49]. Only those TcoFs were extracted that are characterised as 'high-confidence' in TcoF-DB.\nNetwork node ranking\nOur network model is represented as a weighted directed graph [63]. To the best of our knowledge there is no standard procedure for node ranking in weighted directed graphs. Here we define our own method for node ranking, which we believe is appropriate to estimate each node's potential influence in the biological networks described in this article. Our measure for a node in the network shows certain similarities to the Katz centrality measure [64]. However, Katz centrality is only defined for undirected graphs. In addition, we only consider the influence of node n to connected nodes up to the second degree, whereas Katz centrality has no such restriction.Thus, each node n in the network is ranked according to its first-degree edges en1 (weighted out-degree, sum of weights for directed edges from the considered node) and second-degree edges en2 (weighted out-degree, sum of weights for directed edges from the first degree nodes with respect to n). The score Sn for a node n is specified as:Sn= &#8721;en1+w*&#8721;en2,where w is a weighting factor for the second-degree edges en2 that should have less influence on the score then first-degree edges en1.There are three different types of edges in the network that are differently weighted:1. miRNA targets protein &#8594; et2. TF regulates miRNA &#8594; er3. Protein-protein interaction &#8594; eiIn the network model, we specify that et = 1, et > er > ei > 0. The weight for er is sampled randomly from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1. The weight ei is sampled afterwards from a uniform distribution between er and 0. Thus it is ensured that always et > er > ei is true. In addition, we sample the weighting factor w as well from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1.With the three random sampled weights we can calculate Sn for each node n and rank each node in the network according to Sn. Finally this procedure is repeated 10, 000 times with different randomly sampled weights. The final rank for a node n is the average rank over the 10, 000 rankings. This procedure ensures that no fixed weighting schema is used.\nAuthors' contributions\nSS, US, and VBB conceptualised the study.

These results suggest that, in settings such as these, more comprehensive or ambitious WASH interventions may be needed to achieve a major impact on child health.Conclusion\nThese results are important because such basic interventions are often deployed in low-income rural settings with the expectation of improving child health, although this is rarely the sole justification. Our view is that these three new trials do not show that WASH in general cannot influence child linear growth, but they do demonstrate that these specific interventions had no influence in settings where stunting remains an important public health challenge. We support a call for transformative WASH, in so much as it encapsulates the guiding principle that &#8211; in any context &#8211; a comprehensive package of WASH interventions is needed that is tailored to address the local exposure landscape and enteric disease burden.Electronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (10.1186/s12916-019-1410-x) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.", "body": "Background\nRecently, the results of three large factorial randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) interventions were published [1&#8211;3]. These three studies &#8211; referred to as the WASH-Benefits Bangladesh (WASH-B Bangladesh), the WASH-Benefits Kenya (WASH-B Kenya) and the Sanitation Hygiene Infant Nutrition Efficacy (SHINE) trials &#8211; were each conducted in a low-income rural setting with a high burden of stunting, and the WASH interventions delivered were very similar. All three evaluated the effects of these interventions on childhood diarrhea and linear growth, both independently and when combined with standard nutrition interventions. All three studies found no effect of any WASH intervention on child linear growth, and only mixed effects on diarrhea across the sites.The studies were all cluster-based randomized controlled trials employing a factorial design to permit the evaluation of both the independent and combined effects of WASH and nutrition interventions on the outcomes of interest. Consenting pregnant women residing in the study areas were enrolled, together with their children in utero, and then followed up for between 18 and 24&#8201;months. A variety of health outcomes were assessed, including diarrhea prevalence and child growth (length-for-age z-scores). While the &#8216;treatment&#8217; was allocated at a cluster level, typically forming one or two villages, the WASH interventions were delivered at the level of the household or immediate compound (typically two or three households) within which the enrolled children were born. As such, little change in community level coverage was effected as the index households or immediate compounds accounted for only a small fraction of the total number of households within a given cluster or community.These studies adhered to best practice guidelines for human participant research [4], with pre-registration of trials (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01590095, NCT01704105, NCT01824940), published protocols, and pre-specified analysis plans [5, 6]. The protocols included detailed measurement strategies with objective health outcomes and were adequately powered to detect small differences between arms. Active control arms were employed in two [2, 3] of the three trials, and data were managed remotely and analysed in duplicate by blinded statisticians.The low-cost WASH interventions evaluated are typical of those often featuring in policy and programs in rural settings in low-income countries (LICs). All three included interventions to increase chlorination of drinking water at the point-of-use, to increase access to, and use of, &#8216;improved&#8217; pit latrines, including the safe disposal of child feces; and to increase handwashing with soap by providing &#8216;handwashing stations&#8217; with an ongoing supply of soap (Table&#160;1). The implementation fidelity was high, with all interventions delivered as per protocol, and high compliance facilitated by regular provision of free commodities and&#160;supported by contextually appropriate, theory-based behavior change communication delivered to participants during regular home visits.\nTable 1Summary description of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) and nutrition interventions evaluated under the WASH-Benefits and SHINE trialsTrialWaterSanitationHygieneNutritionWASH-Benefits trial, Bangladesh [7]&#8195;Intervention armWater chlorination and promotionLatrine improvements and promotionHandwashing&#160;stations with soap&#160;and&#160;hygiene promotionNutrient supplementation and promotionWASH SDG classification [7]n/aBasicBasicn/a&#8195;Details of interventionA 10-L storage vessel with supply of disinfectant tabletsAn &#8216;improved&#8217; two-pit water-sealed latrine, plus potties and child stool collection deviceTwo handwashing stations per household, near latrine and kitchen, with regular supply of soapDaily small-quantity of lipid-based nutrient supplement and promotion of appropriate and safe complementary feedingWASH-Benefits trial, Kenya [8]&#8195;Intervention armWater chlorination and promotionLatrine improvements and promotionHandwashing station with soap, and hygiene&#160;promotionNutrient supplementation and promotionWASH SDG classification [7]n/aBasicBasicn/a&#8195;Details of interventionCommunal chlorine dispenser and supply of bottled chlorineAn &#8216;improved&#8217; single pit latrine with plastic slab and hole-lid, plus potty and child stool collection deviceTwo handwashing stations per household, near latrine and kitchen, and quarterly supply of soapDaily small-quantity of lipid-based nutrient supplement and promotion of appropriate and safe complementary feedingSHINE trial, Zimbabwe [9]&#8195;Intervention armWater chlorination and promotionLatrine construction and promotionHand-washing stations with soap and&#160;hygiene promotionNutrient supplementation and promotionWASH SDG classification [7]n/aBasicBasicn/a&#8195;Details of interventionMonthly delivery of chlorine solutionA ventilated improved pit latrine constructedTwo handwashing stations per household, near latrine and kitchen, and monthly delivery of soapDaily small-quantity of lipid-based nutrient supplement and promotion of appropriate and safe complementary feedingAbbreviations: n/a not applicable, SDG Sustainable Development Goal, WASH water, sanitation and hygieneThe results of these trials arrive at the inception of an ambitious new WASH Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) that calls for, &#8220;universal access to safe and affordable drinking water and adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all by 2030&#8221; [7]. These results&#160;also come at a time when calls are being made for the further integration of WASH across multiple health sectors, including nutrition [8] but also others such as neglected tropical diseases [9], and maternal and neonatal health [10]. Against this backdrop, and in response to these findings, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) convened an expert meeting of researchers to consider the implications of this new evidence for WASH policy and research.\nConsensus messages\nHere, we distil the salient points of consensus from the meeting into five key messages.\n1. Despite high compliance, the evaluated WASH interventions \u2013 as delivered in these settings \u2013 had no effect on linear growth, and mixed effects on diarrhea\nWe judge these trials to have high internal validity (Fig.&#160;1; full table in Additional&#160;file&#160;1), constituting good evidence that these specific interventions &#8211; as delivered in these settings &#8211; had no effect on childhood linear growth, and mixed effects on childhood diarrhea. Our view is that fidelity and compliance were at least as high as what might reasonably be expected in a typical WASH project or program.\nFig. 1Cochrane risk of bias assessment for the WASH-Benefits and SHINE trialsIn all three trials, these basic WASH interventions had no effect on linear growth (Fig.&#160;2). The high validity of these studies and the consistent effects across three separate sites constitute good quality evidence that these basic WASH interventions, as delivered in these settings, did not reduce stunting. In addition, the novel factorial design of these trials provides good evidence that these WASH interventions in these populations offered no additonal benefit to the evaluated nutrient supplementation intervention as delivered alone. Whilst the effects on linear growth were consistent the underlying reasons for this lack of effect may differ between settings.\nFig. 2Summary of key reported results for the WASH-B and SHINE trialsThe observed effects on diarrhea were mixed, ranging from no effect in Kenya [2] and Zimbabwe [3], to a large relative risk reduction in Bangladesh &#8211; albeit against a much lower baseline prevalence [1]. These differences could be the result of interactions between the interventions and features of the study setting and/or population; for example, the local etiologies of diarrheal disease, pre-intervention WASH conditions, the relative importance of different environmental transmission pathways for diarrhea, and the relative importance of zoonotic agents of infection. Recent studies demonstrate the diversity of diarrheal disease etiology across settings and age groups [11, 12], with the transmission of different pathogens more or less likely to be interrupted by basic WASH interventions. For example, Cryptosporidium, a well-established waterborne cause of both endemic [11] and epidemic diarrhea [13], is highly chlorine resistant, thereby likely&#160;rendering chlorination, as evaluated in these trials, ineffective [14].As pointed out by numerous researchers over the decades, different environmental settings require different WASH interventions [15], and the same interventions may even have different effects on health in the same settings at different times [16]. In grossly contaminated environments, where childhood exposure to a variety of enteric pathogens occurs through multiple environmental pathways, partial or even absolute elimination of a single pathway may yield no health benefit. At the same time, under different conditions, small incremental gains may, in some cases, prove catalytic [17, 18]. Alternatively, while some interventions may fail to significantly reduce endemic diarrheal disease, they may still offer protection against epidemic diarrheal disease events [1].\n2. The biological plausibility of WASH as public health interventions is not challenged by these findings\nIt is well-established that contact with human feces is hazardous to human health: human feces contain&#160;various disease-inducing viruses, bacteria, protozoa, and other parasites [19]. Ingestion of these microorganisms in sufficient quantity has been demonstrated to cause disease in decades of challenge studies for a range of pathogens, e.g. Vibrio cholerae [20], Shigella [21], and Campylobacter [22]. Fecal&#8211;oral transmission of these pathogens can occur by multiple environmental pathways [23], and all WASH interventions can plausibly prevent some fraction of that transmission. This logic is not challenged by these findings, but the mixed results for diarrhea suggest that these interventions had heterogenous effects on childhood environmental exposure to enteric pathogens [24].Two of the three trials [1, 2] published ancillary studies to assess the effects of the intervention on environmental contamination [25&#8211;27]. They did this by quantifying fecal indicator bacteria (Escherichia coli) in environmental media corresponding to environmental transmission pathways for diarrheal disease. In Kenya, only the water treatment arm reduced E. coli levels in stored drinking water, and no WASH intervention reduced E. coli levels on children&#8217;s hands or on sentinel objects [27]. In Bangladesh, two studies were conducted: the first, four&#8201;months after the intervention, sampled drinking and ambient water, children&#8217;s hands, food given to young children, courtyard soil and flies, in the sanitation only and combined WASH arms [26]; the&#160;second, 12 and 24&#8201;months after the intervention, sampled drinking water at source and as stored, children&#8217;s hands, children&#8217;s food and sentinel objects [25]. In the first of these two studies [26], the prevalence of E. coli in stored water was reduced only in the combined WASH arm (prevalence ratio [PR] 0.38; 95% CI:0.32&#8211;0.44), with no effect on any other sampled pathway (soil, hygiene, flies or food). In the second study, the prevalence of E. coli in stored drinking water was reduced by the water treatment only intervention (PR 0.62; 95% CI 0.53&#8211;0.72) and combined WASH intervention (PR 0.75; 95% CI 0.69&#8211;0.81), and the prevalence of E. coli in food was reduced in the single water treatment arm (PR 0.70; 95% CI 0.57&#8211;0.86), the single handwashing (PR 0.68; 95% CI 0.56&#8211;0.83) and combined WASH interventions (PR 0.89; 95% CI: 0.78&#8211;1.01) [25].Against a low baseline prevalence of diarrhea, and the limited environmental impact of the WASH interventions evaluated, it is notable that a 40% relative reduction in diarrheal disease prevalence was achieved in Bangladesh (an absolute reduction of approximately two percentage points&#160;compared to a one-week prevalence of 5.9% in the control arm) [1]. This result was strengthened by a separate comparison of the prevalance of giardiasis across study arms which also showed a marked reduction in infections among all WASH arms except water chlorination [28]. In both the Kenya and Bangladesh trials, which included chlorination only intervention arms, bacterial contamination of stored drinking water was reduced in this arm, but there was no effect on diarrheal disease. As discussed above, this may be&#160;due to the resistance of certain diarrhegenic pathogens&#8217; resistance to chlorine, e.g. Cryptosporidium and Giardia [29].These results suggest that, in settings such as these, more comprehensive or ambitious interventions may be needed to achieve a major impact on child health. In different settings, with more limited WASH conditions &#8211; for example, where most people practice open defecation or rely on untreated surface water &#8211; these interventions may still yield benefits. Alternatively, in similar settings, more ambitious interventions that address other potentially important exposure sources and/or routes, such as animal waste or foodborne transmission, may be effective in reducing diarrheal disease.\n3. Historically, large, population-level gains in child health have not been achieved without significant improvements in WASH services\nGlobally, as countries and regions have transitioned from scenarios in which most of the population have limited or basic WASH services, to one in which most have access to safely managed services, there have been large&#160;coincident improvements in public health. Often these improvements have been dramatic with regards to child health and mortality, specifically [30&#8211;32]. They have commonly been associated with major improvements in water and sanitation infrastructure akin to the SDG category of &#8216;safely managed services&#8217; - that is&#160;ensuring a piped supply of safe drinking water directly to the household, or reticulated transportation of human waste to treatment facilities &#8211; rather than the more modest changes in service access evaluated in these trials.Typically, these changes took place over decades. For example, in Victorian Britain, while the great municipal water reforms began in the 1840s, it was not until the 1870s that major investments in sewered household connections began in most cities [32]. Changes in diarrheal disease mortality followed slowly. In London, for example, infantile diarrheal disease mortality was still rising in 1900. In fact, trends in child and infant mortality suggest that benefits accrue from incremental and progressive steps over time, and that major health dividends may come late in that process, as was the case in England and Wales (1900&#8211;1920) [32] or in the USA (1920&#8211;1930) [31]. Specific innovations are sometimes credited with these health benefits &#8211; e.g., in the USA, disinfecting water supplies coincided with major health gains &#8211; but crediting these health improvements to water treatment alone ignores, for example, the fact that the infrastructure for the distribution of this treated water was already in place. The lesson perhaps lies in not seeking to attribute benefits to individual WASH factors but in that the public health dividends are paid when comprehensive services are in place, as now envisaged under the new SDG.These new studies do not challenge the general view that large-scale improvements in water and sanitation infrastructure played an important historical role in improving child health in high-income countries (HIC). The interventions coinciding with dramatic improvements in child health in many&#160;of these HICs represented decades of large-scale public investment in piped drinking water and sewered sanitation, as opposed to the provision of basic pit latrines, point-of-use chlorination of water, and handwashing stations as&#160;evaluated under these trials.\n4. Current evidence suggests that basic WASH services alone are unlikely to have a large impact on childhood stunting\nA Cochrane Review published in 2013, which addressed the effect of WASH interventions on linear growth, identified very few rigorous&#160;studies. It concluded there was, &#8220;weak evidence of a borderline statistically significant small effect of 0.08 HAZ&#8221; [33]. Subsequent intervention studies have produced mixed results, from significant improvements in linear growth [34, 35] to no effect [36&#8211;38]. The new trials considered here hypothesised that WASH interventions might improve linear growth among children by reducing symptomatic and asymptomatic enteric infections, with this effect mediated at least in part by environmental enteric dysfunction (EED) [5, 6], a subclinical condition affecting gut structure and function [39]. The reported effects on symptomatic enteric infections &#8211; that is, caregiver-reported diarrheal disease &#8211; were mixed, as discussed above, but all three studies found no effect of any WASH intervention arm on linear growth. Furthermore, these factorial studies were specifically designed to assess the combined and independent effects of WASH and nutrition interventions on linear growth, and found no additive benefit of these basic WASH interventions versus nutrition (that is, improved infant and young child feeding, including daily, small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplements during the period of complementary feeding), alone.If symptomatic and asymptomatic enteric infection contributes to linear growth&#160;faltering, as hypothesized by these studies [5, 6], these&#160;results&#160;suggest that preventing these infections is unlikely to be achieved with low-cost basic household interventions in highly contaminated settings where young children are exposed to enteric pathogens repeatedly and via multiple routes. To what extent more intensive WASH interventions &#8211; such as providing a microbially safe and continuous supply of drinking water piped to the household, or a community-level sewered sanitation system &#8211; might impact childhood stunting remains an open question that has so far not been addressed by rigorous trials [33]. The lack of experimental studies of such interventions&#160;reflects multiple inherent challenges, including the difficulty of randomly allocating networked infrastructure; the generally high levels of population movement in urban areas; and the long follow-up and large sample sizes required to study linear growth among children. These challenges are not insurmountable, but are certainly formidable.The results reinforce a well-established view in the nutrition sector that tackling a multifactorial chronic condition such as stunting requires broad and sustained action at multiple levels and across different sectors [40]. The postnatal nutrient supplementation and complementary feeding behaviour change interventions in these same trials, achieved only modest gains in linear growth, despite very high and sustained compliance. These effects are consistent with the wider literature [41, 42], further demonstrating that the underlying causes of stunting remain remarkably poorly understood, and that population-level reductions likely require broad strategies to increase both the availability of nutrients and to&#160;reduce nutrient malabsorption. The experience of Brazil, where a dramatic decline in stunting has been achieved, is of three decades of sustained action across multiple sectors, including food, health, social protection as well as water and sanitation [43].\n5. The results of these trials do not undermine the new and ambitious SDG target of safely managed services for all\nIn summary, the basic, household-level interventions evaluated under these trials did not test the ambitious new SDG targets of universal access to safely managed water and sanitation, and therefore do not provide evidence for or against this level of service. The interventions evaluated in these trials effected only modest changes with regard to the &#8216;WASH ladder&#8217; concept that has been developed for tracking progress against the SDG targets&#160;[7]. This ladder represents incremental gains in the quality of WASH services, and there is some&#160;evidence to support the assumption that, as the quality of services improve, so too does the magnitude of effect on diarrheal disease. However, the evidence for higher levels of service (e.g., piped drinking water and sewered sanitation connections) is generally of low quality [44].The &#8216;sanitation&#8217; interventions included in these trials did not seek to &#8220;end open defecation&#8221; at a community level, which is a key component of the WASH&#160;SDG (SDG 6.2). Instead, the trials focused on improving sanitation at the level of the child&#8217;s household, or immediately around the household, as earlier formative work suggested that children&#8217;s environmental exposure to enteropathogens occurred within the household or the immediate compound domains [45, 46]. The effect of these interventions on community-level sanitation was, therefore, limited. In fact, at baseline, in both Bangladesh and Kenya, access to household sanitation facilities was relatively high pre-intervention.The &#8216;water&#8217; interventions in these trials sought only to improve the microbial quality of drinking water drawn from existing water sources by promoting chlorination in the household. Under the WASH SDG, safely managed drinking water is defined as, &#8220;drinking water from an improved water source that is located on premises, available when needed and free from fecal and priority chemical contamination&#8221; (SDG 6.1) [7]. In these trials, the distribution of drinking water was not changed to bring water sources closer&#160;to the&#160;household, to limit service disruptions to ensure water was available when needed, and chemical or microbial contamination of drinking water at source was not addressed. In relation to how water influences disease transmission, an old distinction can be drawn between &#8216;waterborne&#8217; transmission, that is where transmission occurs via ingestion of water containing pathogens, and &#8216;water-washed&#8217; transmission, wherein person-to-person transmission results from insufficient water to practice adequate personal and domestic hygiene [47, 48]. It has been observed that when the household water supply is on-plot&#160;or piped directly into the household, the amount of water consumed increases dramatically [49], and to a level wherein adequate water is available to meet hygiene needs and reduce health risks [50, 51]. Critically, then, neither the distance to water source nor the volume of water consumed was changed by these interventions.These trials did not evaluate the effect of safely managed water and community-level safely managed sanitation services, as called for under the new WASH&#160;SDG, on child stunting or diarrhea. The basic interventions evaluated in these trials&#160;were seemingly insufficient to comprehensively reduce enteric pathogen exposure, and had mixed effects on diarrhea. This may, in part, explain the lack of effect on stunting, if diarrhea mediates at least some part of this relationship.\nConclusions\nThese three trials evaluated similar WASH interventions in low-income rural settings and found no effect on childhood stunting and mixed effects on childhood diarrheal disease. Conventionally, WASH interventions are understood to&#160;act on these health outcomes by changing infrastructure and/or behaviors to limit environmental exposure to infectious agents. The interventions assessed under these three major trials were relatively successful in the first stage of changing infrastructure and/or behaviours, but seemingly failed to sufficiently reduce environmental exposure to enteric pathogens to improve linear childhood growth.While randomization offers clear advantages with regards to internal validity, this can come at the cost of external validity and generalizability [52]. In clinical studies, the observed relationship between intervention and outcome can often be reasonably assumed to hold constant over time, population and setting. The same should not be assumed for complex public health interventions that interact powerfully with external contextual factors, which may diminish or potentiate effects. However, that these three studies evaluated the same interventions under similar protocols in three different settings sheds at least some light on the generalizability of findings and potential sources of observed heterogeneity.These results warrant attention because basic WASH interventions similar to these are often deployed in low-income rural settings&#160;with the expectation of improving child health, although this is rarely the sole justification. At the same time, these interventions did not address common features of national WASH policies; i.e., drinking water supply or distribution, and community-level sanitation. As an example of this, the current national WASH policies of all three countries (Bangladesh, Kenya and Zimbabwe) where these studies took place aim to end open defecation, and to expand, repair or rehabilitate rural water supplies. At a global level, too, these aspects of WASH not addressed in these trials&#160;are central to the new SDG, with its objectives of ending open defecation and ensuring universal access to safely managed drinking water [7].WASH trials often produce heterogenous results, reflecting the inherent complexity of interventions combining infrastructure and behavior, and which interact strongly with specific, local environmental and social systems. Indeed, the mixed results for diarrheal disease reported across these three trials of very similar interventions bear witness to this. Our view is that these three new trials do not show that WASH in general cannot influence child linear growth, but rather that these specific interventions failed to do so in settings where stunting remains an important public health challenge. These findings warrant the attention of policy-makers and practitioners, and should give some pause for reflection with regards to the design of programs in low-income rural settings that include such low-cost WASH interventions&#160;with the goal of improving&#160;child growth and reducing diarrhea.With growing evidence of the burden of enteric pathogen carriage, and the associated growth and developmental consequences in low-income settings [11, 12], calls have been made for &#8216;transformative WASH&#8217; [53] or &#8216;WASH++&#8217; interventions [54]. Although not clearly defined, nor as yet evaluated, we support this call for transformative WASH because it encapsulates the guiding principle that &#8211; in any context &#8211; what is needed is a comprehensive package of interventions tailored to address the local exposure landscape and enteric disease burden.\nAdditional file\n\nNone\n\nAdditional file 1:Table providing full details of Cochrane risk of bias assessment for the WASH-Benefits and SHINE trials (Word document).

In this study, sediment cores distributed across a submarine mud volcano (SMV) offshore southwestern Taiwan were investigated to determine the characteristics of fluids generated through the convergence between the Eurasian and Phillippine Sea Plates.

Our results imply that SMVs could act as a conduit to channel the fluids produced from great depth/temperature into seafloor environments in a subduction system of the western Pacific Ocean.", "body": "Introduction\nFluid cycling is of great importance to magma and seismicity generation in subduction systems. The release of fluid from the subducting plate into the overlying wedge decreases the liquidus temperature of lithospheric materials, thereby increasing the degrees of partial melting and facilitating melt extraction for arc magmatism1. Such fluid circulation in the deep crustal region also leads to increasing the pore pressure and reactivity of minerals, modifying the rheological property and weakening the rock strength1&#8211;3. The discharge of deeply generated fluids into the bottom ocean further influences the distribution of biological communities and seawater chemistry4,5. Therefore, a systematic assessment of fluid origins and its intrinsic characteristics in subduction systems would facilitate the implementation of a quantitative framework for fluid cycling and budget.Sediment compaction and mineral dehydration are the most important mechanisms for fluid generation and circulation in an accretionary prism6,7. In essence, both mechanisms are driven by the increasing pressure and temperature associated with sediment burial and deformation. However, the geochemical signatures inherited from individual mechanisms are drastically different. Porewater excluded by sediment compaction through burial and deformation bears a composition essentially identical to seawater (e.g., ~560&#8201;mM chloride, and &#948;18O and &#948;2H values around 0&#8240;). In contrast, lattice-bound water released by mineral dehydration is salt-free and carries &#948;18O and &#948;2H values deviating from its sourced fluid (e.g., seawater)8&#8211;10. Volatile elements (e.g., B, and Li) desorbed from clay minerals are also commonly accompanied with&#160;mineral dehydration11,12. Fluids generated from different mechanisms are, however, susceptible to the mixing during migration, thereby obscuring the pristine signatures that could be used to constrain the source depth, physico-chemical parameters of reactions, and fluid budget. Elucidating the observed characteristics remains challenging and often requires a sampling strategy targeting specific geological features or structures.As one of the prominent seafloor features, submarine mud volcanoes (SMVs) are commonly distributed in accretionary prisms where rapid sedimentation and tectonic interaction lead to the gravitational instability of unconsolidated shale/mudstone, fluid overpressurization, and formation of dense fracture array9,12&#8211;14. Because the fracture network associated with the plate convergence could be extended to as deep as the lower crust, SMVs are able to efficiently export deeply sourced fluids, sediments, and reducing volatiles to the seafloor, generating morphological domes and depressions, mudflows, and even biological hotspots with colonies depending on leaked gaseous hydrocarbons8&#8211;10. While SMVs provide a window to witness the deep subsurface characteristics, upward migrating hydrocarbon gases produced by thermal maturation or methanogenesis also drive the sulfate-dependent anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) at shallow depths9,10. Such a biological removal mechanism has been considered to be effective in maintaining a low level of methane in seawater15. Overall, the exact characteristics and quantities of deep fluids discharged from SMVs, and their impacts on biogeochemical activities remain poorly constrained in the subduction system of the western Pacific Ocean.In this study, we present a comprehensive geochemical dataset of fluids extracted from sediment cores recovered from sites distributed across an SMV, TY1, in the accretionary prism offshore southwestern Taiwan (Fig.&#160;1). These data were used to assess the fluid source, formation temperature, and fluid-rock ratio for the reaction in the source region. Reactive transport modeling was further applied to quantify the fluxes of fluid and methane exported from various sediment compartments to seawater. Finally, the possible fluid transport pathways in the Taiwan accretionary prism were discussed.Figure 1(a) Bathymetric map overlaid with the distribution of mud volcanoes21,71, mud diapirs20, geological structures20,71, and study site TY1 offshore southwestern Taiwan (the map was created by the open source GMT software72 using the NOAA public database73).

(c) A topographic profile for TY1 (N to S in b) with the core sites projected.\nGeological Settings\nOffshore southwestern Taiwan is a westward extending accretionary prism related to the subduction of the Eurasian Plate underneath the Philippine Sea Plate since 18 Ma16&#8211;18. The deformation front and its southward extension, the Manila trench, defines the boundary between passive and active margins (Fig.&#160;1a). The active margin is further divided into two structural domains separated by the out-of-sequence thrust: the Lower Slope and the Upper Slope domains19 (Fig.&#160;1a). The Lower Slope domain is featured with the fold-and-thrust ridges; in contrast, the Upper Slope domain is characterized by mud diapiric structures with mud volcanoes 20. To date, 13 submarine mud volcanoes have been identified21. The largest one, Tsangyao Mud Volcano Group (TYMV; re-named after MV1222), is composed of two mud volcanoes (TY1 and TY2; Supplementary Fig.&#160;S1) fed by one mud diapir, as evidenced by seismic reflection profiles21,23. The TY1 has a conical structure and a wide flat top with a diameter of ~500&#8201;m at a water depth of ~370 m21 (Fig.&#160;1b,c). Fluid/mud discharges occur at a frequency of every 3 to 10 seconds24. Two major gas plumes were detected on the crest by a multibeam echo sounder. These gas plumes could reach to a height of up to 367&#8201;m above the seafloor24. Other gas venting signals were also observed at the flank of the TY1 (Supplementary Information, Fig.&#160;S2).\nResults\n\nFluid geochemistry\n\nVariation of solute profiles across TY1\nProfiles of solute and gas concentrations are shown in Figs.&#160;2 and 3. Most porewater in the upper 120 to 280&#8201;cm of sediment had a seawater-like composition. Below this interval at the center sites, concentrations of most ions decreased with depth (potassium, sodium, magnesium, calcium, chloride, and sulfate). In contrast, concentrations of total alkalinity (TA), boron, and lithium increased with depth. Between 120 and 280&#8201;cm below seafloor (cmbsf), sulfate was undetectable and accompanied by an increase in methane concentration (1&#8210;2&#8201;mM), forming a sulfate to methane transition zone (SMTZ). Changes in concentration gradient of other solutes were also observed across the SMTZ. For example, calcium and magnesium concentrations decreased to ca. 1&#8201;mM and lower than 5&#8201;mM below the SMTZ, respectively. The decrease was coincident with the increase in TA concentration (to around 35&#8201;mM).Figure 2Concentration depth profiles and results of reactive transport modeling.

The modeled upward velocity was also provided.

(b) Lithium (gray dot) and boron (black dot) concentration profiles&#160;at eight sites.At the upper flank (site&#160;MV12-A) and lower flank (site F6-3) sites, significant decreases in sulfate, calcium, and magnesium concentrations coincided with the increase in methane and TA concentrations (Figs.&#160;2 and 3). Both lithium and boron concentrations remained at constant values throughout the core at the upper flank site. In contrast, boron and lithium concentrations increased with depth at the lower flank site, where SMTZ was observed at the bottom of the core.At margin sites (sites MV12-C and C-2), concentrations of most ions were close to seawater values. In addition, methane concentrations only increased to at most 50&#8201;&#956;M. Both boron and lithium concentrations at site MV12-C decreased with depth (Fig.&#160;3b).\nPorewater isotope data\nProfiles of &#948;18O and &#948;2&#919; values of porewater are shown in Fig.&#160;4. At center sites, &#948;18O and &#948;2&#919; values of porewater were close to 0&#8240; at either above 120 or 280 cmbsf, and increased and decreased, respectively, further down core. The data for the deepest sample deviated from the global meteoric water line (GMWL) in a way that &#948;18O values increased to +6 to +7&#8240; while &#948;2&#919; values decreased to &#8722;20 to &#8722;12&#8240; (Fig.&#160;4d,e). At the upper flank (site&#160;MV12-A) and lower flank (site&#160;F6-3) sites, only slight variations in &#948;18O and &#948;2H values were observed at the bottom of the core (&#948;18O value increased to +0.7&#8240; and &#948;2H value decreased to &#8722;1.1&#8240;). At the margin sites (sites&#160;MV12-C and C-2), &#948;18O values were close to 0&#8240; throughout the core, while &#948;2H values decreased slightly to &#8722;1.4&#8240; at the bottom of the core.Figure 4(a&#8211;c) Profiles of chloride concentrations and &#948;18O and &#948;2H values.

The &#948;13C-CH4 value was the smallest at the SMTZ (&#8722;50 to &#8722;45&#8240;) and remained at a constant value below the sulfate reduction zone (Fig.&#160;5). At the upper flank (site&#160;MV12-A) and lower flank (site&#160;F6-3) sites, the &#948;13C-CH4 value was the smallest at the SMTZ (&#8722;70&#8240; at site&#160;MV12-A and &#8722;48&#8240; at site&#160;F6-3). The &#948;13C-DIC (dissolved inorganic carbon) patterns for center and flank sites were similar in a way that the values were the smallest at the SMTZ (&#8722;30&#8240; at site 24; &#8722;20&#8240; at sites MD4-P3 and MD4-P1) and increased towards the seafloor (~0&#8240;) and the bottom of the cores.Figure 5Profiles of &#948;13C-CH4 (in red) and &#948;13C-DIC values (in black). Gray shadows represent the SMTZ at each site.The C1/C2+ ratios and the &#948;13C-CH4 values for sites A2-2 and MD4-P3 were between 25 and 90, and between &#8722;35.9 and &#8722;44.5&#8240;, respectively, falling in the region of thermogenic methane in the plot of C1/C2+ ratio versus &#948;13C-CH4 value (Fig.&#160;6). For sites 24 and 24-2, the &#948;13C-CH4 values were between &#8722;48 and &#8722;37&#8240;, whereas the C1/C2+ ratios increased to more than 120. These data points fell in a region between microbial and thermogenic methane.Figure 6Plot of &#948;13C-CH4 value versus C1/C2+ ratio for samples collected at center sites. The assignment of gas origin is based on Bernard et al.76.\nReactive transport modeling and fluid flux from SMVs\nThe reactive transport modeling yielded that upward fluid velocities at western and southern center sites were in the range of 2 to 3 and 2 to 5&#8201;cm&#8201;yr&#8722;1, respectively (Fig.&#160;2). Upward fluid migration is likely absent at the margin site as the solute concentration do not change significantly with depth. The total fluid discharges from the craters and the rest of the cone structures of 13 SMVs were calculated to be 2.9 to 7.3&#8201;&#215;&#8201;106&#8201;kg&#8201;yr&#8722;1 and 1.0 to 1.7&#8201;&#215;&#8201;107&#8201;kg&#8201;yr&#8722;1, respectively (Supplementary Table&#160;S6).The modeled methane fluxes beneath the depth of SMTZ at the western and southern centers were in the range of 1020&#8210;1530 and 972&#8210;2990&#8201;mmol&#8201;m&#8722;2 yr&#8722;1, respectively (Table&#160;1). The methane fluxes above the SMTZ at these center sites were 162&#8210;1380&#8201;mmol&#8201;m&#8722;2 yr&#8722;1. The methane flux beneath and above the depth of SMTZ was much lower (347&#8210;456 and 9&#8210;47&#8201;mmol&#8201;m&#8722;2 yr&#8722;1, respectively) at the flank sites (sites&#160;MV12-A and F6-3) than at the center sites. While the methane fluxes above and beneath the SMTZ decreased with the distance from the center, the ratios (flux beneath SMTZ/flux above SMTZ) were relatively higher at the flank sites than at the center sites. Such a variation was translated into an increase in AOM efficiency from 54% at the center sites to 98% at the lower flank sites (Table&#160;1).Table 1Microbial activity derived from reactive transport modeling.UnitWestern centerSouthern centerUpper flankLower flankA2-224MV12-1*MD4-P1MD4-P324-2MV12-AF6-3Rate of anaerobic methanotrophymmol m&#8722;2 yr&#8722;18588618729431610740300447Rate of organic sulfate reductionmmol m&#8722;2 yr&#8722;140.531.814.233.64.8019.914.534.4Rate of methaogenesismmol m&#8722;2 yr&#8722;124.232.952.220.068.036.61.785.57Methane flux from depthmmol m&#8722;2 yr&#8722;110201530115012802990972347456AOM-filteration efficiency%8456767454768698*Parameters (core length and lower boundary conditions) are assumed to be the same as those for site A2-2 (Supplementary Table&#160;S4).\nDiscussion\nThe decreasing chloride concentration with depth (Fig.&#160;4a) and carbon isotopic composition and abundance patterns of methane (Figs.&#160;5 and 6) suggest an input of freshwater and thermogenic methane from great depth. Crossplots among &#948;18O values, &#948;2H values, and chloride concentrations (Fig.&#160;4e) indicate the deviation of the fluid compositions for the center sites from the GMWL and seawater. The geochemical variation could be best accounted for by the impact of seawater and a deep fluid characterized by low chlorinity, high &#948;18O values, and low &#948;2H values. Such variations in &#948;18O and &#948;2H values cannot be explained by gas hydrate dissociation, ash alteration at high or low temperature, or biogenic opal recrystallization, as these reactions enrich fluids with 2H or cause no fractionation on hydrogen isotopes8,10. Clay dehydration appears to be the most plausible mechanism to account for the observed geochemical signature.To approximate the temperature of fluid formation, specific cation-ratios were used to derive the fluid temperature25&#8211;27. The validity of geothermometers lies in the requirement of the presence of reactant mineral. Since sediments or mineralogy in the source region are not available, the constituent mineral for the formation currently outcropping in southwestern Taiwan was first adopted to evaluate the applicability of the specific geothermometer. The inference is based on the fact that the subduction of the Eurasian Plate underneath the Philippine Sea Plate generated a series of westward propagating thrusts that sequentially exhumed the sediments once deposited offshore Taiwan18. Therefore, the strata on land could mirror the characteristics and constituents of sediments in the potential source region that is accessible only with the deep drilling. The Plio-Pleistocene Gutingkeng Formation formed in shelf break environments was chosen as the analogy for the source material. The formation is primarily composed of mudstone with lens of siltstone and sandstone28. Feldspars at abundances of up to 5% in this formation have been observed29. In addition to the constraint from the formation in terrestrial environments, feldspars in cores retrieved from the ODP 1144 site in the abyssal region of the South China Sea amounted up to 1.33 wt.% of the total sediments30. Therefore, both observations support the possibility that feldspars are available in the source region and serve the source of sodium and potassium in fluids. The geothermometer based on the Na/Li and Na/K ratio were used for the temperature estimation25,27,31:1\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$T(^\\circ {\\rm{C}})=\\frac{1195}{log(\\frac{Na}{Li})-0.13}-273$$\\end{document}T(&#176;C)=1195log(NaLi)&#8722;0.13&#8722;2732\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$T(^\\circ {\\rm{C}})=\\frac{1170}{log(\\frac{Na}{K})+1.42}-273$$\\end{document}T(&#176;C)=1170log(NaK)+1.42&#8722;273where the concentration is in molality in Eq. (1) and mg/kg in Eq. (2). The Ca-Mg-K and Mg/Li geothermometers were not considered because the porewater chemistry for all depths at the TY1 is oversaturated with respect to a number of carbonate minerals, such as dolomite and Mg-calcite (Supplementary Table&#160;S1). Furthermore, the concentration of magnesium is lower than what is expected by the dilution of seawater by freshwater alone, again suggesting the potential removal of magnesium by carbonate precipitation (Supplementary Fig.&#160;S3). The SiO2 geothermometers were not applied due to the potential underestimate caused by rapid cooling through the intrusion of the overlying seawater26.The fluid temperature was calculated to range between 100 and 150&#8201;&#176;C. Our estimated temperature is supported by the high concentrations of lithium and boron (Fig.&#160;3b), a pattern consistent with the results from laboratory experiments by which lithium and boron are preferentially released from silicate minerals in marine sediments starting at ca. 50&#8201;&#176;C32&#8211;34. The estimated temperature is also consistent with the predominance of thermogenic methane over microbial methane as being inferred on the basis of isotopic compositions and abundance ratios (Fig.&#160;6). Furthermore, the geothermal gradients measured at TY1 vary from 25&#8201;&#176;C/km at the margin sites to 390&#8201;&#176;C/km at the center sites23. Since the crater is directly connected with the conduit channeling hot fluids from great depth, the measured geothermal gradient would be distorted toward a higher value by the advective fluid flow23,35. Instead, the averaged value35 (25&#8201;&#176;C/km) measured at the margin sites and in surface sediments in the region was chosen to represent the regional geothermal gradient. Using this value, the depth producing the observed geochemical signatures was calculated to range between 3.6 and 5.7 kmbsf (kilometer below seafloor).These lines of evidence indicate that a significant fraction of pore fluid is contributed from clay dehydration at high temperatures. Illite and chlorite, which are considerably abundant in sediments offshore southwestern Taiwan36, are excluded because illite and chlorite are dehydrated at a much higher temperature range (>237&#8201;&#176;C for illite37 and >650&#8201;&#176;C for chlorite38). Kaolinite is also excluded as a result of being less abundant in the northern South China Sea39 and stable over the temperature range estimated in this study (decomposed at >800&#8201;&#176;C and 19 GPa40). Since the transformation of smectite to illite proceeds at a temperature higher than 60&#8201;&#176;C8,34 and produces fluids enriched in 18O and depleted in 2H, smectite is considered to be the most plausible mineral candidate to account for the observed geochemical signature. As abundant smectite and mixed layer (1.1&#8210;24.8 wt.% in bulk sediments) have been found in the active margin41 and passive margin off southwestern Taiwan39,42, and sediments off the Luzon Arc43&#8211;46 (ODP, sites 1144 and 1146), smectite sourced from Taiwan orogeny and Luzon Arc volcanism and later being subducted/accreted as part of the Taiwan accretionary prism is the most likely source.To further assess the smectite dehydration, we adopted an isotopic mass balance to calculate the ratio of water to rock (W/R) for reactions considering the exchange of oxygen and hydrogen between minerals and pore fluid under a closed-system condition47. The fluid-to-mineral ratio for the reaction was calculated based on the mass balance for hydrogen and oxygen isotope compositions47:3\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$${W}_{o}{\\delta }^{18}{O}_{pw}^{i}+{R}_{o}{\\delta }^{18}{O}_{r}^{i}={W}_{o}{\\delta }^{18}{O}_{pw}^{f}+{R}_{o}{\\delta }^{18}{O}_{r}^{f}$$\\end{document}Wo&#948;18Opwi+Ro&#948;18Ori=Wo&#948;18Opwf+Ro&#948;18Orf4\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$${W}_{H}{\\delta }^{2}{H}_{pw}^{i}+{R}_{H}{\\delta }^{2}{H}_{r}^{i}={W}_{H}{\\delta }^{2}{H}_{pw}^{f}+{R}_{H}{\\delta }^{2}{H}_{r}^{f}$$\\end{document}WH&#948;2Hpwi+RH&#948;2Hri=WH&#948;2Hpwf+RH&#948;2Hrfwhere WO and WH are moles of oxygen and hydrogen, respectively, in porewater; and RO and RH are moles of oxygen and hydrogen, respectively, in target minerals.

To constrain the possible porosity at the depth estimated for smectite dehydration, the porosity variation for cores collected from the Nankai Trough54 (IODP 358, site C0002, 3.2-km long) was used for the extrapolation. The measurement from IODP 358 yielded a porosity of 17% at the depth of 3.2 kmbsf&#8201;54. By applying the exponential reduction function, the porosity at 5.7 kmbsf was calculated to be 5.6% (Supplementary Table&#160;S2). Assuming that the porespace is saturated with porewater and that the porosity is 6%, the quantity of porewater would be lower than 3 wt.% of the bulk sediment. To fulfill the estimated W/R ratios (0.3&#8211;1.9) for smectite dehydration, 1.6&#8211;10 wt.% of smectite is needed. Such a mineral abundance is consistent with the measured amount of smectite in the current active and passive margin41,43&#8211;45 (1.1 to 6.2 wt.% in sediments collected by a sediment trap deployed southwestern Taiwan; 4.5 to 24.8 wt.% in sediments from the ODP 1144 and 1146).As subducted-smectite could be the source of freshwater, fluid fluxes in the SMV region of the accretionary wedge were further assessed. The total amount of smectite-bound fluid within the incoming plate was estimated considering the weight of the incoming plate and the content of smectite and porosity in the sediments55&#8211;57:7\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$${F}_{a}={C}_{a}\\cdot H\\cdot (1-{\\varphi }_{a})\\cdot \\rho \\cdot {V}_{a}\\cdot {L}_{a}$$\\end{document}Fa=Ca&#8901;H&#8901;(1&#8722;&#966;a)&#8901;&#961;&#8901;Va&#8901;Lawhere Fa is the flux, Ca is the weight percentage of mineral-bound water in smectite, H is the pre-subducted sediment thickness, &#961; is the density of dry sediments, &#966;a is the porosity of sediments from the incoming plate, La is the length of trench, and Va is the subduction rate. The details for calculations were stated in Supplementary Information. The total smectite-bound fluid from the incoming plate was calculated to be 0.7&#8211;8.8&#8201;&#215;&#8201;108&#8201;kg&#8201;yr&#8722;1.As sediments are subducted, the buried seawater-like pore fluid and produced smectite-bound fluid would be squeezed and lost gradually with the increasing temperature and pressure. As a result, the actual amount of water released into SMVs region would be substantially lower than that from the incoming plate. Of the overall flux of brackish fluid expelled from SMVs offshore Taiwan (1.3&#8211;2.5&#8201;&#215;&#8201;107&#8201;kg&#8201;yr&#8722;1), approximately 80% of this flux could be attributed to the smectite-bound fluid (1&#8211;2&#8201;&#215;&#8201;107&#8201;kg&#8201;yr&#8722;1) considering the mixing of seawater and freshwater end components (based on the chloride concentration, 110&#8201;mM, at the bottom of site MD4-P3). This quantity of smectite-bound fluid released from the SMVs in the region constituted about 1.1&#8211;28.6% of the smectite-bound fluid originally subducted into the trench (0.7&#8211;8.8&#8201;&#215;&#8201;108&#8201;kg&#8201;yr&#8722;1).Previous modeling study using the data integrated from geophysical and mineralogical observations for the Nankai Trough6 demonstrated that the majority of the smectite-bound fluids (4.17&#8201;&#215;&#8201;108&#8201;kg&#8201;yr&#8722;1; 88% of total smectite-bound fluids in the incoming plate) would be lost to the frontal prism, leaving a total of 0.56&#8201;&#215;&#8201;108&#8201;kg&#8201;yr&#8722;1 smectite-bound fluids further released into the overlying wedge as the descending sediments reach the region beneath the Kumano basin where mud volcanoes are abundant. If such a fluid budget for the Nankai system is directly applied to the Taiwan subduction system, a total of 0.8&#8211;10.4&#8201;&#215;&#8201;107&#8201;kg&#8201;yr&#8722;1 (&#8201;=&#8201;0.7&#8211;8.8&#8201;&#215;&#8201;108/ (4.17&#8201;&#215;&#8201;108/ 88%/ 0.56&#8201;&#215;&#8201;108)) smectite-bound fluids would be released from the descending sediments into the wedge in the Upper Slope. This estimated flux is comparable with the flux of freshwater expelled into seawater through SMVs offshore Taiwan obtained in this study (1&#8211;2&#8201;&#215;&#8201;107&#8201;kg&#8201;yr&#8722;1). Whether such an analogy of the fluid budget could be drawn directly remains to be explored even though the plate geometry, heat flux, mineral type and content, convergence rate, and the distance between trench to mud volcanoes are comparable between the Nankai and Taiwan subduction systems (Supplementary Table&#160;S3).The impact of the deep fluid on shallow subsurface microbial processes is reflected in geochemical profiles. The decreasing rate of upward fluid flow from the center towards the margin sites (Fig.&#160;2) varied concomitantly in a similar and an opposite trend with the modeled AOM rates and efficiency, respectively (Table&#160;1 and Supplementary Table&#160;S5). For example, at site MD4-P3 where the upward velocity was the greatest, the AOM rate was the highest among eight sites (1610 mmol m&#8722;2 yr&#8722;1), and the AOM efficiency was the lowest (54%) (Table&#160;1). In contrast, the upward fluid flow was absent at the lower flank site, whereas the AOM efficiency reached 98% (Table&#160;1). Such an observation suggests that the upward velocity of the fluid is the primary control of AOM rates. As the capacity of AOM is limited, the efficiency of methane removal could not accommodate the extremely high supply of methane at center sites. This pattern is consistent with those obtained in onshore mud volcanoes in Taiwan22,58 and SMVs elsewhere (e.g., the Hakon Mosby SMV59).\nConclusions\nPorewater and gases for cores distributed along a transect of TY1 were systematically analyzed to assess the spatial variation of fluid velocities and biogeochemical activities and further constrain the fluid budget. The co-variation of the isotopic composition and chloride concentration demonstrates that the majority of fluid retrieved from the crater is derived from smectite dehydration at a temperature of 100 to 150&#8201;&#176;C or a depth of 3.6 to 5.7 kmbsf. Assuming that the isotopic equilibrium is reached, the water-rock interaction proceeds at a water-rock ratio of more than 0.3. Reactive transport modeling for compounds inert to microbial processes yielded that the velocity of upward migrating fluid varied from 2 to 5&#8201;cm&#8201;yr&#8722;1 at the center sites to a negligible level at the margin sites. By extrapolating such a variation pattern for other SMVs offshore Taiwan, the overall flux discharged from SMVs ranged from 1.3 to 2.5&#8201;&#215;&#8201;107&#8201;kg&#8201;yr&#8722;1. This fluid quantity accounts for 1.1&#8211;28.6% of the smectite-bound water originally stored in the incoming sediments, implying that SMVs could act as a conduit to channel the fluid produced from great depth/temperature into seafloor environments. The flux variations across the transect of a mud volcano strongly impact the magnitude and efficiency of the biological filtration of methane through methanotrophy.\nMethods and Materials\n\nSampling sites\nFour expeditions were conducted in the offshore southwestern Taiwan by R/V Ocean Researcher 5 (legs 1309&#8211;2 and 0039) and R/V Ocean Researcher I (legs 1107 and 1118). Piston and gravity cores with lengths ranging from 102 to 720&#8201;cm were recovered along a transect from the center to the margin of the TY1 cone structure (Fig.&#160;1c). Sampling sites are listed in Table&#160;2 and shown in Fig.&#160;1b,c.Table 2Information of coring sites.CruiseSiteLongitudeLatitudeLocationOR5-1309-2MD4-P3120o 33.46&#8242;21o 49.59&#8242;southern centerOR5-1309-2MD4-P1120o 33.49&#8242;21o 49.62&#8242;southern centerOR5-003924120o 33.28&#8242;21o 49.66&#8242;western centerOR1-1107MV12-1120o 33.28&#8242;21o 49.67&#8242;western centerOR1-1107MV12-A120o 33.27&#8242;21o 49.47&#8242;upper flankOR1-1107MV12-C120o 33.26&#8242;21o 49.08&#8242;marginOR1-1118A2-2120o 33.48&#8242;21o 49.63&#8242;western centerOR1-111824-2120o 33.28&#8242;21o 49.66&#8242;southern centerOR1-1118F6-3120o 33.34&#8242;21o 49.24&#8242;lower flankOR1-1118C-2120o 33.27&#8242;21o 49.07&#8242;margin\nSampling and analytical methods\nSediments and core top seawater for gas analyses were collected and transferred into serum bottles. These bottles were later filled with saturated NaCl60 (in cruises OR5-1309-2 and OR5-0039) or 1&#8201;N NaOH58 (in cruises OR1-1107 and OR1-1118) as preservatives, sealed with butyl rubber stoppers, crimped with aluminum caps, and stored upside down at room temperature or 4&#8201;&#176;C. Pore fluid samples for aqueous geochemistry were obtained through centrifugation and subsequently filtered through 0.22-&#181;m nylon membrane syringe filters. The filtrates were further split into five fractions for the analyses of anion, cation, total alkalinity (TA), carbon isotopic compositions of DIC, and oxygen and hydrogen isotopic composition, and stored at 4&#8201;&#176;C. For the cation samples, concentrated nitric acid (70%) was added at a volume ratio of 1:45 to preserve the valence state for elements sensitive to the redox change.The concentrations of headspace hydrocarbon gases were determined by a gas chromatography (GC; SRI 8610&#8201;C and Agilent 6890&#8201;N) with the precision typically better than 5%22,58. Ion concentrations were determined by an ion chromatography (IC, 882 Compact IC Plus) equipped with a Metrosep A Supp 5 column for anions and a Metrosep C 4 column for cations and with the detection limit around 0.1 ppm in weight61. Lithium and boron were analyzed by a sector field inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (SF&#8211;ICP&#8211;MS) for 7Li and 11B at low resolution (M:&#916;M ~300). Six standards were prepared from reference material NASS&#8211;5 (all from National Research Council Canada) with the uncertainty better than 3%. TA was determined by titrating the sample with 0.02&#8201;N HCl while bubbling with nitrogen62. Carbon isotopic compositions of methane and DIC were measured by an isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) in line with a gas chromatography and a combustion oven. Hydrogen and oxygen isotope compositions of porewater were measured by a LGR Liquid-Water Isotope Analyzer (LWIA; for cruises OR5-1309-2 and OR5-0039) and a Picarro L2140-i Analyzer (for cruises OR1-1107 and OR1-1118). The obtained isotopic compositions were expressed as the &#948; notation referenced to standards [&#948;&#8201;=&#8201;(Rsample/Rstd &#8722; 1)&#8201;&#215;&#8201;1000&#8240;, where R is the ratio of heavy over light isotopes]. Standards are the Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite (VPDB) for carbon isotope, and the Vienna Standard Modern Ocean Water (VSMOW) for hydrogen and oxygen isotopes. The precisions are &#177;0.3&#8240; for &#948;13C values by the IRMS measurements, &#177;0.2&#8240; for &#948;18O values and &#177;2.0&#8240; for &#948;2&#919; values by the LWIA measurements, and &#177;0.03&#8240; for &#948;18O values and &#177;0.22&#8240; for &#948;2&#919; values by the Picarro spectroscopic measurements. The water content of cored sediments was calculated based on the weight loss of the sediments after freeze-drying. The porosity was converted from the water content assuming a dry sediment density of 2.7&#8201;g&#8201;cm&#8722;3&#8201;63.\nReactive transport modeling\nTo deduce the velocity of upward fluid in such a dynamic environment64, a simplified one-dimensional reactive transport modeling was applied for porewater geochemistry profiles with a revised code65. The concentration-depth profiles of five dissolved species, including chloride, sodium, potassium, sulfate, and methane, were calculated. This model is formulated by a partial differential equation for solute transport and reactions65,66. The modeling was first performed on conservative solutes (chloride and sodium) exempted from microbial processes and most abiotic reactions in shallow sediment environments to determine the range of upward advection rates. The sodium and chloride concentrations in the shallow sediments (the top 120 to 280&#8201;cm of sediments; Fig.&#160;2) did not vary much and cannot be attributed to bioirrigation67. Therefore, irrigation induced by bubble transport was incorporated to explain such constant concentrations60,68. Microbial reactions involving sulfate and methane were considered12,65. A detailed description of model-construction, chosen parameters, and boundary condition in the model along with additional sensitivity tests are given in the Supplementary Information.\nFluid discharge from SMVs\nTo estimate the total discharge of brackish water from SMVs, the upward fluid velocities across the TY1 were compiled first with those obtained in the previous study22. The upward fluid velocities generally decreased with increasing distance from the edge of crater. Such a trend is also found in other SMVs in offshore Norway and the Gulf of Cadiz12,69 (such as the H&#229;kon Mosby and Carlos Ribeiro SMVs). To generalize the fluid velocities across the entire cone structure, the variations in velocity with distance from the edge of the crater were fitted with the exponential equation (Supplementary Information, Fig.&#160;S9a). The calculation was based on the assumption that the fluid flow was confined through porespace and driven by a single, pressurized fluid source.The velocity distribution was further integrated with the ring area coverage (Supplementary Information, Fig.&#160;S9b) to derive the total brackish water discharge using the following equation12:8\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\begin{array}{c}{\\rm{Brackish}}\\,{\\rm{water}}\\,{\\rm{discharge}}\\,({\\rm{kg}}\\,{{\\rm{yr}}}^{-1})\\\\ \\,=\\,{\\rm{porosity}}\\times {\\rm{area}}({{\\rm{m}}}^{2})\\times {\\rm{upward}}\\,{\\rm{fluid}}\\,{\\rm{velocity}}\\,({\\rm{m}}\\,{{\\rm{yr}}}^{-1})\\times {\\rm{density}}({\\rm{kg}}\\,{{\\rm{m}}}^{-3})\\end{array}$$\\end{document}Brackishwaterdischarge(kgyr&#8722;1)=porosity&#215;area(m2)&#215;upwardfluidvelocity(myr&#8722;1)&#215;density(kgm&#8722;3)In this calculation, the crater radius of 250&#8201;m, the cone diameter of 3600&#8201;m21, and the porosity of 36% (an average value of the porosity of TY1; Supplementary Fig.&#160;S6) were used. The density of water was assumed to be 1000&#8201;kg&#8201;m&#8722;3. The same approach was applied to other 12 SMVs assuming that the upward velocity at the crater of individual SMVs was the same as that at TY1. Since each SMV has different diameters of its crater and cone structure, the relationship between the velocity and the distance ratio was constructed (normalized to the distance from the edge of crater). Such a relationship was then applied to calculate the discharge fluxes of other individual SMVs (Supplementary Information, Table&#160;S6). Terrestrial mud volcanoes were not considered because their sizes are too small when compared to SMVs70. More details are described in Supplementary Information.\nSupplementary information\n\nNone\n\nsupplementary information.\nsupplementary dataset.\n", "pmid": "31942015", "title": "Discharge of deeply rooted fluids from submarine mud volcanism in the Taiwan accretionary prism", "journal_title": "Scientific Reports", "authors": "Nai-Chen Chen;Tsanyao Frank Yang;Wei-Li Hong;Tsai-Luen Yu;In-Tian Lin;Pei-Ling Wang;Saulwood Lin;Chih-Chieh Su;Chuan-Chou Shen;Yunshuen Wang;Li-Hung Lin", "doi": "10.1038/s41598-019-57250-9", "score": "0.0117100915"}, {"keywords": "antibiotics;Gram-negative bacteria;cell envelope;protein channels;nanopores;influx;antibiotic resistance", "abstract": "One of the main fundamental mechanisms of antibiotic resistance in Gram-negative bacteria comprises an effective change in the membrane permeability to antibiotics. The Gram-negative bacterial complex cell envelope comprises an outer membrane that delimits the periplasm from the exterior environment. The outer membrane contains numerous protein channels, termed as porins or nanopores, which are mainly involved in the influx of hydrophilic compounds, including antibiotics. Bacterial adaptation to reduce influx through these outer membrane proteins (Omps) is one of the crucial mechanisms behind antibiotic resistance. Thus to interpret the molecular basis of the outer membrane permeability is the current challenge. This review attempts to develop a state of knowledge pertinent to Omps and their effective role in antibiotic influx. Further, it aims to study the bacterial response to antibiotic membrane permeability and hopefully provoke a discussion toward understanding and further exploration of prospects to improve our knowledge on physicochemical parameters that direct the translocation of antibiotics through the bacterial membrane protein channels.", "body": "Introduction\nAntibiotic resistance can be defined as the capability of any microbial organism to counterattack effects of antimicrobial drugs (antibiotics) (Figure 1A) used against them.1,2 This phenomenon has become a global communal health threat due to an enormous increase in annual death rate.2 The emergence of highly resistant organisms has led to the requirement of new antibacterial drugs.1 Due to the slow progress of the current antibiotic research, there exists an enormous gap between bacterial evolution and the rate of development of novel antibiotic drugs.1,3,4 Only about two new classes of antibiotics have been brought to the market in the last three decades. On the technical front, there is an urgent need for a greater understanding of how antibiotics work, how bacteria progress with resistance against these antibiotics, and what molecular machinery could be exploited to get around bacterial defense mechanisms.1&#8211;4 The current innovative way of improving the potential of antibiotics is to effectively introduce them into bacteria and further prevent them from degradation by bacterial enzymes before they reach their targets. There is an extreme necessity for counteracting the problem of multi-antibiotic resistance.1,4 The important mechanism (Figure 1B) of resistance toward antibiotics known till date includes the enzymes-mediated deactivation of antibiotics for example, &#946;-lactamase enzymes which hydrolyze and confer resistance against a diverse variety of antibiotics including penicillins, cephalosporins, carbapenems, and many more.4&#8211;7 The outer membrane vesicles (Figure 1C), these native vesicles released by Gram-negative bacteria, are mainly composed of periplasmic and outer membrane components including lipopolysaccharides, proteins, lipids, and other molecules.8&#8211;11 They help the producer cells while communicating with other cells concerning pathogenesis, secretion, nutrients acquisition, and self-defense.5,8&#8211;10 These moieties protect bacteria from various environmental stress factors including antibiotics, for example, gentamicin, imipenem, ampicillin, melittin, colistin, and many more.8&#8211;14 Further, resistance mechanism is also mediated by reducing the entry of antibiotics into the target site of bacteria which is mainly effected by specific alteration of outer membrane permeability (Figure 2). Efflux pumps effectively contribute towards resistance mechanism by antibiotic expulsion. In addition, antibiotic target proteins, for example, penicillin-binding proteins, are altered inside the bacterial cells, leading to antibiotic resistance.2,3,5,6,15&#8211;21In this review, we present a systemic overview of the role of different membrane protein transporters responsible for antibiotic transport, present in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria.4&#8211;6,22 We highlight the different achievements of the scientific community in understanding the uptake of different solutes including antibiotics.7,17,22 This active knowledge of the role of outer membrane influx in antibiotic transport in Gram-negative bacteria can be useful for antibiotic drug development in the future, where the computed data can be employed toward understanding the detailed mechanism of bacterial membrane transport, and to further design novel antibiotics with an effective permeability profile.\nGram-negative bacteria\nGram-negative bacteria have a multifaceted cell envelope comprising an outer membrane that restricts the access to the periplasm by acting as a molecular filter, thus forming an efficient selective permeation barrier.4&#8211;6,23,24 This outer membrane, like other biological membranes, is fundamentally built up of a bilayer of lipids.6,18,25,26 As such, this lipid bilayer membrane is mostly impermeable to hydrophilic molecules including nutrients.22,25,27 The effective intake of hydrophilic molecules is mainly controlled by specific water-filled open channels termed as outer membrane proteins (Omps) or porins.22,27&#8211;29 These Omps are intensively characterized in Gram-negative bacteria and are further distinguished as nonspecific and specific Omps in accordance with their functional structure (monomeric or trimeric),6,7,22,24&#8211;26,28 substrate specificity, regulation, and expression.15,18,29,30 These membrane proteins do not show any hydrophobic stretches in their amino acid sequences and majorly form hollow &#946;-barrel structures with a hydrophobic outer surface.28,31 The barrel structure encompasses the transmembranous pore-type structure with a crucial function of facilitating the passive flux of hydrophilic substances22,28 and further acting as a functional diffusional barrier for nonpolar solutes.6,28 These proteins might show specific selectivity in general for either cations or anions.5,22,28Bacterial adaptation to reduce influx through these Omps is an increasing problem that contributes, together with efflux systems, to antibiotic resistance.3&#8211;5,20,23,32&#8211;34 An existing challenge for drug design is to interpret membrane permeability at molecular level to get a better insight into the role of membrane transport (Figure 2) in bacterial resistance mechanism.4&#8211;7,20,35 Like other hydrophilic molecules, polar antibiotics including &#946;-lactam antibiotics and fluoroquinolones majorly sneak into Gram-negative bacteria using these Omps.5,31,33 Any slight modification by the bacteria in the responsible Omps can significantly affect the antibiotic drug therapy.33 Many clinically pertinent bacterial species including Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii have been sequenced for determining the effective key Omps (Table 1) present in the outer membrane.3&#8211;6,23,28,31&#8211;33,36,37 Further, bacterial bugs including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii possess an innate low vulnerability toward &#946;-lactams, through reduced outer membrane permeability.5,6,20,22,38 For instance, reduced membrane permeability in Pseudomonas aeruginosa as compared to Enterobacteriaceae mainly occurs due to less number of Omps present in the outer membrane and their distinct physicochemical properties.22,38&#8211;41 In other Gram-negative bugs, for example, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter and Klebsiella pneumoniae, susceptibility toward &#946;-lactam molecules is closely related to the presence of nonspecific diffusion Omps, for example, OmpF and OmpC.5,6,22Previous works showing the effective role of different Omps (Table 1) in molecular influx of different antibiotics are shown in Table 2. We discuss the achievements of the scientific community in this area by studying the role of different Omps in outer membrane permeability, using separate set of theoretical and experimental techniques including molecular simulation (MS), electrophysiology, minimum inhibitory concentration assay, liposome swelling assay, X-ray crystallography, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer.\nDiscussion\n\nComputing influx\nTypical antibiotic activity toward bacterial cell occurs in micromolar concentration range, thereby representing values that are approximately limited to a thousand molecules inflowing the cell in few minutes to hours.7,22 Such numbers are considerably beneath the detection limit of most of the techniques and thus require significant amplification of the signal.4,7,22,110 Measuring the flux of small molecules across the outer cell membrane can be possibly achieved by different approaches including whole-cell assays, which require computation of flux using genetically engineered bacterial cell.7,111,112 These methods involve soaking bacteria in antibiotics for a fixed time followed by a separation process to remove the external media from the internalized antibiotics.7 However, the quality of the separation method is crucial for improving permeability.7,111,112 There are several published studies employing whole-cell assays to quantify the uptake, and their quality has been intensively compared.7,110&#8211;116 Once the separation technique allows collecting sufficient amounts of internalized antibiotics, several biophysical methods can be used to quantify the intracellular antibiotics.7,113&#8211;118 One of the promising tools for studying intracellular accumulation is mass spectrometry. The technique was successfully applied in measuring the uptake of antibiotics;117,118 for example, a work demonstrated cellular uptake of linezolid by E. coli using liquid chromatography&#8211;mass spectrometry.118The discussed methods allow quantifying the total turnover of a cell uptake which represents the relevant actual effective concentration seen by the bacteria. On the contrary, the comprehensive flux depends on a multitude of parameters and renders the molecular understanding difficult.7,22 To understand the molecular origin of the antibiotic uptake, we need information on the role of each individual involved component. For example, the so-called liposome swelling assay provides information on a model system.35,52,55,60,80,97,105 The method involves reconstitution of batches of purified Omps into (multilamellar) liposomes.7,22 Under isosmotic addition, the diffusion of substrate inside the liposome results in alteration of the light-scattering pattern. The effective change in light-scattering signal is then correlated with the relative permeability of the molecules. The main disadvantage of this method is that it requires a large quantity of material and is only effective for uncharged molecules, whereas for charged molecules, the effect of counterion flow affects the quality of the measurement. Moreover, the assay can only determine average turnover numbers and often does not provide conclusive values.7Moreover, using conventional electrophysiology, computation of rate of flux of discrete small molecules across Omps present in bacterial outer cell membrane involves measurement of flux values at single molecular level.7,36,45,52,56,66,67 Here, electrophysiological measurement using single Omps provides the best high-resolution (Figure 3) signal-to-noise ratio,7,18,40,73,74,83 thereby suggesting the higher efficacy of this method in sensing and understanding uptake at molecular level.7,15,22 The method includes reconstitution of a single or multiple Omps into an artificial planar lipid bilayer and further uses transmembrane potential-driven ion current across the channel as a detection probe.7,67 Using ion current as a probe specifically demonstrates very well-characterized electrophysiological properties of the Omps,15,34,45,65,66,84,106,119&#8211;121 including size,122,123 single-channel conductance, channel ion selectivity,58,75,76,90,99&#8211;101 channel gating dynamics, and more.47,95,109 Likewise, the size of Omps is a key factor defining transport through the channel.107,108 This factor plays a key role in antibiotic susceptibility.72&#8211;74 Determination of the size of Omps using electrophysiology provides a crucial insight into the maximum size of molecule they can transport.122,123 This, further, helps in evaluating the inner structure including constriction site.122&#8211;125 Further, single-channel conductance of Omps, ion selectivity,58,75,76,84,89 and gating dynamics35,47,94,95,109 give an insight into the channel&#8211;substrate binding and channel&#8211;substrate interactions.35,71,83,85,97,99,101 An insight into the channel conductance can be obtained, specifically using staircase electrophysiology (Figure 3A and B), where real-time insertions of single channels at constant voltage can be attained.59,123 The conductance of any channel can be termed as its unique characteristic. This allows a better understanding of the open/close states of the channel and its gating dynamics which can then be employed in studying channel structure&#8211;activity relationship.35,71,107,108Using these functions, a proper insight into the channel interaction with different substrates can be obtained including substrate-induced partial or full blockage (Figure 3C) of channel52,53,67 and substrate-induced gating.67 The function of these pores has been well documented on the basis of pore characteristics, chemical modification, and genetic mutations.15 These parameters were further used to elaborate transport of the following antibiotics: meropenem,52 imipenem,52 cefotaxime,48 cefpirome,44 ceftriaxone,44,45 cefepime,45 ceftazidime,44,45 ciprofloxacin,45 norfloxacin,45 and enrofloxacin45 through OmpC; imipenem,74 meropenem,53 ceftazidime,44,45,74 cefepime,45,55,74 ceftriaxone,44,45 cefpirome,44 ampicillin,57,60,61,67 benzylpenicillin,60 amoxicillin,57 carbenicillin,57 azlocillin,57 piperacillin,57 ciprofloxacin,45 norfloxacin,45,56,126 enrofloxacin,7,45,54,66,72 moxifloxacin,65 different poly arginines,64 polyamines,106 and antimicrobial peptides51 through OmpF; ceftriaxone80 through Omp35; cefepime16 through Omp36; imipenem91 and meropenem91 through OccD3; imipenem86 through OccD1; and meropenem,104 glutamic acid,104 arginine,104 and imipenem104 through CarO Omp (Table 2).In contrast, single-channel recording provides the best signal-to-noise ratio and intrinsic data on Omp&#8211;substrate interaction.40,45,65&#8211;67 But the interpretation of molecule translocation cannot be made directly as the chances of molecule exit on the entry side are almost identical when compared to the transport of the molecule across the pore.7 Whereas in the case of charged molecules, direct conclusion of translocation can be made as the increasing voltage will reduce the residence time of the molecules inside the Omp, which might provide some evidence of transport across the Omp. In addition, using channel selectivity, that is, channel inherent selection of either anion or cation, a quantitative flux assessment of the charged molecules can be made using electrophysiological reversal potential measurements.36,59 Using this approach, flux of &#946;-lactamase inhibitors across OmpF and OmpC was estimated, showing the role of Omps in their transport across bacterial biobarrier.36,59 However, most of the molecules did not carry a net charge or show low intrinsic solubility which makes them trivial to measure and thus excludes them from screening via this method. Furthermore, the finite time resolution of electrophysiology also makes the method limited in screening of antibiotics uptake.7,45,66,67\nMolecular simulation\nIn the current scenario, MS is well suited to obtain a particular information at an atomic scale.121 Thus far, knowledge of the antibiotic translocation problem has pointed essentially toward three mechanisms including diffusion with molecule binding, a mechanism based on pore dehydration induced by the permeating molecule, and slow diffusion with molecule binding.50,61,62,70,71,97,99,121 Further, to discriminate among these mechanisms, and to attain a better description of the Omps behavior and their role in substrate transport, understanding the communication between pore and substrate is essential.119&#8211;121,127,128 Thanks to the high-resolution, molecular modeling simulations, detailed characterization is possible in terms of energetics (Figure 4 from Ghai et al)36 and bond formation including hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic contacts, and more.50,62,71,121The complete control over the characteristics of the system allows MS to explain the impact of pinpoint mutations and the effects that arise due to different domains of the same proteins.95,100,101 Further, MS significantly allows understanding and interpreting available experimental data.50,61,62,70,121 When combined with experimental approach, MS proves to be a complementary method. For instance, together with electrophysiology,36,48,54,55,57,58,60,61,65&#8211;67,71&#8211;73,95,97,99&#8211;101 MS was used for understanding the transport of &#946;-lactamase inhibitors (Figure 4), interaction of substrates with Omps (enrofloxacin, moxifloxacin, ampicillin, benzylpenicillin, carbenicillin, amoxicillin, azlocillin, piperacillin, ertapenem, imipenem, meropenem, cefepime, cefpirome, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefoxitin, and cefepime with OmpF;7,19,21,36,50,54,55,57,58,60&#8211;63,65&#8211;67,70&#8211;73 cefotaxime, imipenem, and meropenem with OmpC;19,48 natural amino acids with OccD1),87 ion transport including transport of phosphate potassium and chloride ion via OprP90,100&#8211;102 and OprO,99 and interaction of glycine ornithine, glucose, and imipenem with CarO isoforms.105 Further, for liposome swelling55,60,97,105 and minimum inhibitory concentration assay48,60,73 (not described), MS was helpful for understanding and interpreting the experimental results.Rationalizing the process of permeation of antibiotics into Gram-negative bacteria via MS requires an accurate and exhaustive description of some key molecular properties of the antibiotic molecule.121 MS is the best alternative tool to obtain homogenously derived physical&#8211;chemical descriptors for molecules with or without experimental approach.121,127,128 MS based on all-atom empirical force fields with the resolution in microsecond time range and beyond could potentially provide a good level of description of the structural and dynamical properties of biological systems.119,121,127,128\nToward translational research\nTranslational research on understanding antimicrobial resistance has led to implausible development in recent years4,129 together with the expansion of novel techniques including proteomic analyses, high-sensitivity mass spectrometry, computational bioinformatics, and many more approaches.4 For the most part, the discovery of novel technologies, the development of new infrastructures, along with the training of budding scientists have reinforced this evolution.1,4,129,130 But the transition is still not complete, and roadblocks still exist on the path to scientific progress, for example, combining different data into a shared database that can be intrinsically used to understand how Omps located in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria are able to filter molecular influx.24 The imperative need for new, effective Gram-negative antibacterial drugs comes at a time when techniques needed for innovative assays can provide significant crucial data over understanding the effective bottleneck.4 Ideally, the overall penetration&#8211;efflux puzzle4 will form part of a larger understanding of the Gram-negative cell envelope as well as direction on how to create small molecules that can easily penetrate across the outer membranes.4 This information should move the antibacterial research community toward more rational approaches, which may enable the delivery of new agents to treat life-threatening infections.1,4,129,130\nConclusive remarks\nThis review summarizes the progressive scientific evidence explaining the role of Omps in membrane permeability of Gram-negative bacteria. The control of bacterial membrane permeability is a complex process that is strongly structured by an intricate network of arrangements that senses and retorts to pH, osmotic shock, temperature, and external chemical stress. Bacteria majorly make use of cultured regulated cascades that perceive and distinguish toxic compounds and respond through various resistance mechanisms including regulation of Omps.6,7,15,18,22 The information on the role of effective Omps in substrate uptake and their structural relationship associated with their role in transport highlights the efforts of the scientific upfront in the direction of understanding the bacterial resistance.6,7,15,18,22 Translocation across the Omps can be assumed as the first step in the journey of an antibiotic along the defined pathway toward its target. Consequently, interpretation of antibiotic translocation through porins at the molecular level is crucial for understanding the correlation between influx and antibiotic activities within bacteria. The function of the general diffusion pores has been well studied based on pore characteristics, chemical modification, and genetic mutations. Our understanding of the structure of the pore-forming complex has tremendously improved over the last decade with the emergence of MS, state-of-the-art X-ray data, mass spectrometry assay protocols, and novel high-resolution experimental approaches including electrophysiology. However, a better understanding of the transportation mechanism by outer membrane pores is required. The molecular basis of the antibiotic transport via specific porins is still completely open at present, and further rigorous studies are needed to give insight into the structure&#8211;activity relationship of pores associated with antibiotic transport. The data computed for these Omps can be further employed to elucidate the antibiotic uptake pathway through Omps at molecular level, which could possibly empower rational drug design to further enhance permeation and support novel strategies to dodge &#8220;impermeability&#8221;-mediated resistance mechanism.", "pmid": "28919790", "title": "Exploring bacterial outer membrane barrier to combat bad bugs", "journal_title": "Infection and Drug Resistance", "authors": "Ishan Ghai;Shashank Ghai", "doi": "10.2147/IDR.S144299", "score": "0.011699875"}, {"keywords": "Cellular Biology;Issue 124;quantitative microscopy-based imaging;heterocellular co-cultures;cancer-associated fibroblasts;multiplexed assays;population dynamics", "abstract": "Cellular processes are complex and result from the interplay between multiple cell types and their environment.

However, the limitations of these standard assays have become increasingly apparent with the discordance between in vitro and clinical data and the failure of most drugs to receive FDA approval. Here, we present a novel method for utilizing quantitative imaging to simultaneously analyze heterocellular phenotypes in response to relevant, co-occurring environmental stimuli.Traditional cell-based assays that are used to measure cell viability include: trypan blue exclusion assays, MTT/MTS, and Annexin V-FITC flow cytometry staining. Trypan blue exclusion assays, while simple and inexpensive, require a large number of cells, are time consuming, and are often influenced by user bias1. MTT and MTS assays indirectly measure cell viability through measurements of mitochondrial metabolic rate. However, the metabolic activity of cells can be affected by different culture conditions (such as media or oxygen concentration), which leads to inaccurate results and prevents standardization across cell types and conditions23. Another major disadvantage of these techniques is their inability to distinguish between multiple cell types &#8211; most biological systems are heterocellular. While flow cytometry methods have the ability to distinguish between multiple cell populations, cell labels are required, dynamic sampling is challenging, and when using adherent cells, this application becomes time-consuming and error prone.Other important cellular phenotypes, including morphological changes, occur in response to environmental stimuli but are not captured by traditional cell-based assays. Profiling cell states through morphological characterization and mapping similarities across samples is a powerful, unbiased tool with the ability to provide novel insights into many aspects of basic and translational research, including basic cell biology and drug discovery4. Furthermore, tumor cell morphology has been shown to correlate with tumor subtypes5 and aggressiveness6. Hence, it is of great interest to study these cellular features and how they relate to specific environmental perturbations. Additionally, one can use differences in morphological features to discriminate between subpopulations in co-culture systems. Fluorescently labeling cells has downfalls (i.e. altering inherent cell properties, time-consuming) and therefore additional methods to classify cell types are advantageous.Microscopy-based imaging is an alternative method for profiling cellular phenotypes in a multiplexed, quantitative, and robust manner. In this manuscript, we apply our quantitative imaging pipeline to highlight the evolutionary dynamics of heterogeneous cell populations within a tumor. We focus on the interaction between Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) cells and Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs), the most prevalent stromal cell type found in tumors. CAFs have been implicated in tumor initiation, progression, and therapeutic response; therefore, performing phenotypic assays on tumor cells in the absence of CAFs can be misleading789. Specifically, we evaluated effects of CAFs on tumor cells in response to erlotinib, a small molecule targeting the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) that is often used in clinical treatment of NSCLC. We utilized a high-content screening platform and its accompanying image analysis software for evaluation; however, in an attempt to make this methodology accessible to other researchers we have also developed a comparable downstream protocol using the open-source software: CellProfiler10 and CellProfiler Analyst11. Most image-based high-content screening assays are analyzed with commercialized software specific to a given instrument model. Results are difficult to replicate in other labs with different software because the underlying algorithms are often proprietary. Using this image-based pipeline, cell proliferation, death, and morphology of each subpopulation of a heterocellular culture in response to drug treatment using both fluorescence- and morphology-based classification were measured. The following protocol provides a robust methodology for probing complex cellular processes.\nProtocol\n\n1. Cell Culture\nNOTE: Here phenotypic responses of NSCLC cells (H3255) to the EGFR-targeting agent, erlotinib, when co-cultured with lung fibroblasts (CCD-19Lu GFP) were investigated. For the same data set, fluorescence-based and morphology-based classification of the two cell populations (H3255 and CCD-19Lu GFP) to exemplify their concordance was performed. However, only one classification method needs to be used and should be chosen based upon the application.\n2. Preparation of Cells\n\n3. Cell Plating\n\n4. Drug Dosing\n\n5. Image Acquisition\nNOTE: Images were acquired on days 0, &#160;2 and 3. Depending on cell types and cellular processes being studied, other desired time points may be studied.\n6. Image Analysis\nNOTE: All image analysis was performed using proprietary software. However, because this is not a publicly available, comparable analyses were also designed on CellProfiler 2.2 and CellProfiler Analyst 2.0, with a brief protocol listed below and detailed protocol provided as supplementary material (test images are already loaded into pipelines to test workflow). The images from this experiment were grouped together on a per-well basis so that each well could be loaded individually. The CellProfiler pipelines below contain a regular-expression that parses metadata information from each image filename and allows the images to be further grouped by channel.\nRepresentative Results\nWe generated an image set consisting of 25&#160;fields/well, 54 wells/plate (3 cell populations x 6 drug concentrations x 3 replicates), across three plates for a total of 4,050 individual images. The image sets generated over the course of the experiment were analyzed using proprietary software (see table of materials) to extract various quantitative properties of cells (i.e. morphology, fluorescence) which could then be used to classify cell subpopulations. However, because the commercial software used has limited access, comparable downstream pipelines in CellProfiler and CellProfiler Analyst were created.\nHeterocellular Classification into Subpopulations\nNuclei were identified and segmented based on the DNA stain (here Hoechst) and cell populations were classified either based upon fluorescence or morphology (Figure 1). For fluorescence-based classification, the fibroblasts (CCD-19Lu) were previously transduced with GFP-lentivirus. The GFP intensity levels were measured for each nucleus, and those that were calculated above the accepted threshold (based on the background signal) were classified as CCD-19Lu while those below were identified as tumor cells (H3255). For morphology-based classification, cells were previously stained with a non-toxic cellular stain (see the table of materials) and this was used to identify and segment the cytoplasm. A machine learning algorithm was trained with ~50-100 cells from each population. Morphological features were identified that were significantly different between the populations, which were then used to design a linear classifier to distinguish between CCD-19Lu and H3255 cells. The fluorescence and morphology classification protocols were 97.4% (n = 1403) concordant at distinguishing between the two cell populations in untreated conditions and 92.5% (n = 916) concordant in drug treated conditions (1 &#181;M erlotinib) (Figure 2).\nPhenotypic Analyses of Subpopulations\nIn addition to discriminating between cell types, we aimed to characterize phenotypic properties of each subpopulation. Multiplexing assays saves time and reagents, adds consistency, and provides additional information regarding the system being studied. There are many potential phenotypic outputs and one should choose them based upon the questions of interest. Here, changes in the cell morphology and viability status in response to erlotinib treatment were investigated. After three days of drug treatment, a decrease in nuclear area and an increase in cellular area of the H3255 cells (Figure 3A) was observed. The mean difference in nuclear area between the \"no drug\" and \"drug\" treated populations was found to be statistically significant via a two-sided type-2 (equal variance) t-test (p = 7.92 x 10-16). We hypothesize that this observation is a cellular response to the stress imposed by drug treatment.It is also of interest to study whether a drug has a cytotoxic (i.e. increase in number of dead cells over time) or cytostatic (i.e. decrease in number of cell births over time) effect on cells, as this has profound clinical impact. For example, a cytostatic drug effect induces growth arrest yet does not eliminate the cells from the tumor, thus there is the potential for cancer cells to reinitiate cell proliferation once the drug is removed. Drug effects can often be context, concentration, and cell type dependent. We previously observed erlotinib eliciting a cytotoxic response in one cell type, while showing a cytostatic response in another13.Traditional viability assays output relative cell number and therefore, do not discriminate between growth arrests and cell death. Herein, dead cells were identified based upon propidium iodide stain (Figure 3B). Both cytotoxic and cytostatic effects of erlotinib on H3255 cells were observed, with an increase in the number of deaths and a decrease in the number of births following drug treatment (Figure 3C). It is worth noting that the number of dead cells drops following day 1 likely due to cell clearance. CCD-19Lu cells were not affected by the drug. An additional advantage of this platform is the generation of quantitative data. For example, in our co-culture experiment, an initial subpopulation of 1,118 (75.8%) H3255 cells was found to be 2,817 (87.9%) or 396 (57.2%) after three days without or with erlotinib treatment, respectively (Figure 4). Because we can generate actual cell counts instead of relative percentage (as with flow cytometry methods), we conclude that the change in composition during drug treatment is due to a decrease in H3255 cells and not an increase in CCD-19Lu. It is worth nothing that death rates may be underestimated due to cell clearance, which is difficult to assess experimentally and likely differs across cell types.Figure 1: Overview of the Image Analysis Protocol.

A major advantage of this experimental design is the ability to analyze multiple phenotypes with a single setup and generate quantitative data characterizing these phenotypes on a single cell level. One technical advantage to this platform is the ease of initial troubleshooting compared to other assays. Because this method is image-based, one is able to visualize the wells for apparent over/under seeding. It is advisable to have cells in the exponential growth phase for the duration of the experiment and not be limited by nutrient or spatial constraints or confounded by senescence due to scarce seeding. Otherwise, birth and death rates may not be reproducible between experiments. For reference, CellPD is a publicly available program for computation of birth and death rates14. Additionally, one can visualize whether adequate concentrations of dyes were added to each well. Pipetting issues in an individual well could result in missegmentation and skewed data, but can easily be detected with the aforementioned protocol.Unfortunately, not all cell types may be amenable to this application. It is important to be able to accurately segment the nuclei and cells, therefore analysis of cells that organize in more sphere-like or clumped structures may not be suitable. For some cells, it also may be advantageous to use a cell strainer prior to seeding to ensure initial seeding of single cells. In addition, the linear classifier technique is only applicable to cell types that can be readily distinguished based on morphology features. For the success of the protocol, it is important to first optimize the imaging conditions, as the validity of downstream analyses is dependent on the quality of the images. While here we performed experiments using a high-content screening platform, image acquisition can also be performed using any fluorescent microscope (although an automated imaging platform is ideal for high-throughput approaches). Test images should be taken prior to each imaging time point to ensure that there are no problems with the microscope or protocol. The signal to noise ratio should be high, especially for the channels that will be used for segmentation (i.e. nuclei, cell stains). Additionally, it is important to image in the optimal plane of focus. If the images are out of focus, segmentation becomes much more difficult and the calculated morphological features will likely be inaccurate. Illumination differences between fields can cause problems with image segmentation as well. Large differences in brightness make the automated selection of threshold values difficult. Additionally, if there are heterogeneous fluorescence intensities between cells, a single threshold value may not sufficiently segment all the cells in an image. In this analysis, these problems were overcome by creating masks around brighter and dimmer cell populations and segmenting each population separately. While the phenotypes under investigation in this protocol are limited to live, dead, and morphological characterization, they can easily be expanded to investigate other features. For example, functional genetic studies can be added with RNAi, overexpression, or other chemical perturbations. In this paper, the capabilities of the protocol to measure the response of non-small cell lung cancer cells to erlotinib in the presence and absence of CAFs was demonstrated. However, this is merely one example of the many cell types and microenvironmental parameters that can be tested. We have extended this protocol to be used with other cell types and drug studies, including primary cells isolated from patient tumors1315. \nDisclosures\nThe authors have nothing to disclose.", "pmid": "28715383", "title": "Discrimination and Characterization of Heterocellular Populations Using Quantitative Imaging Techniques", "journal_title": "Journal of Visualized Experiments : JoVE", "authors": "Colleen M.

The narrative of social influence during adolescence often revolves around risky and maladaptive decisions, like driving under the influence, and using illegal substances (Steinberg, 2005). However, research has also shown that social influence can lead to increased prosocial behaviors (Van Hoorn et al., 2017) and a reduction in risk-taking (Braams et al., 2019). While many studies support the notion that adolescents are more sensitive to peer influence than children or adults, the developmental processes that underlie this sensitivity remain poorly understood. We argue that one important reason for this lack of understanding is the absence of precisely formulated models. To make a first step toward formal models of social influence during adolescence, we first identify three prominent verbal models of social influence in the literature: (1) social motivation, (2) reward sensitivity, and (3) distraction. We then illustrate how these can be translated into formal models, and how such formal models can inform experimental design and help identify developmental processes. Finally, by applying our formal models to existing datasets, we demonstrate the usefulness of formalization by synthesizing different studies with seemingly disparate results. We conclude with a discussion on how formal modeling can be utilized to better investigate the development of peer influence in adolescence.", "body": "Introduction\nPeers impact almost all aspects of adolescent lives, from the more trivial, such as taste in music and clothing, to the more serious, such as the use of illicit drugs or engaging in unprotected sex (Steinberg, 2008). These latter, riskier, choices may carry life-long consequences for the adolescent and bring significant cost to society. It is empirically well established that the presence of peers influences risky behavior in adolescence (Gardner and Steinberg, 2005; Chein et al., 2011; Pfeifer et al., 2011; Smith et al., 2014), but the underlying developmental processes remain poorly understood. Understanding these processes, however, is important for at least two reasons. First, empowering adolescents to become more competent decision-makers will be more effective if we succeed at tailoring interventions to their developmental affordances. Second, we can only identify these affordances if we succeed at linking adolescent neuronal and cognitive development with adolescent behavior across different social contexts.Here we argue that this link cannot be made without formal models of adolescent peer influence. In this article we thus aim to take the first steps toward a quantitative and testable framework of adolescent social influence. Adolescence is marked by several developmental changes which offer multiple biological explanations of social influence on adolescent decision making. We refer to the current theoretical perspectives of these changes as &#8220;verbal models.&#8221; Verbal models are distinct from formal models in that they do not make quantitative predictions. In order to establish formal models that do make quantitative predictions, we first review existing verbal models and the associated empirical findings about social influence in adolescents, focusing on risky decision-making. We identify three verbal models of social influence which can be subject to developmental change; these are then formalized by grounding them in expected utility theory. Next, we show that our formal models can reliably be recovered and therefore can be used to compare hypotheses via quantitative model comparison. Finally, we fit these models to existing data and reveal previously overlooked patterns of peer influence. We conclude with a discussion on how the specificity provided by this formal approach contributes to a deeper understanding of the developmental processes behind social influence.\nSocial Influence on Adolescent Decision-Making\nWe identify three main families of verbal models in the existing literature, hereafter named as follows: (i) social motivation model, (ii) reward sensitivity model, and (iii) distraction model. These three models focus on two distinct neurodevelopmental explanations of altered decision-making during adolescence. Social motivation verbal models stress the importance of the developing &#8220;social brain.&#8221; The other two verbal models (reward sensitivity and distraction) both emphasize the relatively slow maturation of cognitive control systems. Previous works that fall into the reward sensitivity family of verbal models often refer to it as &#8220;dual-systems&#8221; models, as they also stress the relatively fast maturation of reward-processing brain regions and explain adolescent behavior with the maturational imbalance between reward processing and cognitive control brain regions (Casey et al., 2008; Steinberg, 2008; Geier et al., 2010; Shulman et al., 2016). By contrast, the distraction model has a single focus on the development of cognitive control. Our subsequent review of the existing experimental evidence shows that all three of these families of verbal models are currently equally well supported in the literature, even though each model provides a different explanation for similar observations.\nVerbal Models: Social Motivation\nThe first verbal model we consider states that adolescents have increased social motivation. Demonstrating risky behavior, or conforming to behavior of the peer group, are considered ways to reach these social goals. In other words, social motivation models assume that during adolescence there are situations where a high social value is attributed to displaying risky behavior (Crone and Dahl, 2012; Ruff and Fehr, 2014) which is independent from the non-social value of the outcome (e.g., money).\nVerbal Models: Reward Sensitivity\nThe verbal reward sensitivity model is based on research which suggests that adolescence is the time where fast maturation of reward processing brain systems coincides with relatively slow maturation of cognitive control systems. According to the reward sensitivity model, the biological imbalance between these two systems gives rise to risky adolescent decision-making (Casey et al., 2008; Ernst et al., 2015; Shulman et al., 2016). Here we will not address the debate concerning the validity (Pfeifer and Allen, 2016) or the different variants of these models (Casey et al., 2008; Steinberg, 2008; Larsen and Luna, 2018). Instead, we focus on the element that is suggested to be most relevant for understanding developmental changes in peer influence: reward sensitivity. Reward sensitivity states that social influence has such dramatic effects on adolescent risk-taking because a social context &#8220;may sensitize the incentive processing system to respond to cues signaling the potential rewards of risky behavior&#8221; (Chein et al., 2011, p. 2). Indeed, Chein et al. (2011) showed that while being observed during a risk-taking task, brain regions related to reward processing were more active in adolescents than in adults. This was interpreted as evidence for a reward sensitivity model as it suggests that, in adolescents, the social context itself leads to changes in the processing of rewards in general.\nVerbal Models: Distraction\nThe relatively slow maturation of cognitive control brain regions forms the basis of a third verbal model that we call &#8220;distraction model.&#8221; Here, maturational imbalance and arousal is not only specifically associated with altered representations of reward but more generally with poor self-control and diminishing cognitive skills in emotionally salient situations (Dumontheil, 2016). This lack of self-control can lead adolescents to show more erratic or distracted behaviors in a social as compared to a solitary context. The distraction model does not assume any changes in value computation, but rather suggests that behavioral changes are due to stochasticity in the decision process.Social motivation, reward sensitivity and distraction models do not assume mutually exclusive processes. Although it is plausible that the defining processes emphasized in each of these models simultaneously impact peer influence, it is important to examine which are most relevant in a particular context.This is essential because different models provide different footholds for interventions. For example: if adolescent risk-taking is subject to social motivation it can be fruitful to provide other, less risky, means to acquire social status for instance by using meaningful roles interventions (Ellis et al., 2016, see also: Yeager et al., 2018). Adolescent reward sensitivity suggests it is useful to prohibit teens from gathering in risky situations. For instance, many states in the United States and Canada prohibit teenage drivers from taking other teenage passengers along. Distraction suggests that training in mindfulness and meditation are a good prospect for increasing desirable behaviors in adolescence (Kuyken et al., 2013). These implications for interventions underscore how crucial it is to comprehend the most relevant determinants of adolescent behavior in a given context. We therefore inspect experimental work which manipulated aspects of social contexts with respect to the three verbal models of adolescent social influence: (i) social motivation, (ii) reward sensitivity, and (iii) distraction.\nSeeing and Being Seen \u2013 Empirical Studies of Social Influence\nDespite the complexity of social exchange, studies investigating social influence can be roughly divided into two types of situations: those where the participant observes others and those where the participant is being observed. In the light of this distinction, we review experimental studies about peer influence in adolescent risky decision-making.\nObserving Others\nWhen uncertain of what to do, observing the behavior of others can help with making a decision. Monetary lotteries are often used as an experimental setting with uncertain prospects, wherein the effect of observing the behavior of others can be investigated. In such experiments, participants observe others&#8217; previous decisions (Blankenstein et al., 2016; Reiter et al., 2019) or receive explicit advice (Haddad et al., 2014) while making private decisions. These studies suggest that the impact of social information is greatest in early to mid-adolescence and then declines with age. Notably, in a recent study, adolescents were influenced more by safe than by risky advice (Braams et al., 2019). However, currently evidence seems most in line with models that emphasize social motivation, as an increase in safe decisions is not predicted by reward sensitivity models. A small increase of participant safe choices in studies such as Braams et al. (2019) however, could also be attributed to a greater distraction during adolescence. Notably, none of these studies provided adolescents with information about the outcomes of others&#8217; decisions. In real life, such outcomes are observable; there is evidence that observing others&#8217; risky real-world behaviors, such as smoking or drug use, increases the likelihood of adolescents to adopt these behaviors themselves (Clark and Loh&#233;ac, 2007; Liu et al., 2017). This can reasonably be explained using social motivation models, if adolescents anticipate peer approval. It can also be explained with reward sensitivity models when assuming that the rewarding properties of risky behaviors (smoking) themselves become subjectively more rewarding in this social context.In sum, experimental results from paradigms in which participants observe the choices of others are sometimes more consistent with the social motivation model, and sometimes more consistent with reward sensitivity. Paradigms designed for testing distraction models when observing others are underrepresented, so their pertinence here cannot yet be sufficiently evaluated. As such, which verbal model family best accounts for adolescent behavior when they observe others remains unclear.\nBeing Observed\nWhen a decision maker is observed by another individual, risk-taking also sends a social signal to the observer (Baker and Maner, 2009). For instance, adolescents can show how &#8220;cool&#8221; they are by taking extreme risks, or signal that they are or want to be part of a group by mimicking its members&#8217; risk-taking behavior. Thus, if adolescent behavior in peer contexts is sending a social signal to their peers, their beliefs about the risk-norms of observing peers should impact their behavior. In line with this, one study found that exposing teenagers to risk-accepting peers increased their risky driving while exposure to a risk-averse peers did not (Shepherd et al., 2011). Further, there is evidence that risk perception and understanding of social norms are important predictors of adolescent risky driving (Carter et al., 2014). Social motivation models can therefore explain increased risk-taking in paradigms when participants are being observed.However, even without assuming complex social motivation, behavior change in a social context was traditionally explained with social facilitation theory (Zajonc, 1965), which foreshadowed both reward sensitivity, and distraction models by one principled observation: Being observed induces arousal.The reward sensitivity model suggests that arousal leads to altered reward processing, making risk-taking more appealing. Indeed, most developmental studies of how being observed impacts risk-taking report an increase in the number of risky choices made by adolescents in social contexts (Gardner and Steinberg, 2005; Chein et al., 2011; Smith et al., 2014; Somerville et al., 2018). In the context of social facilitation theory this increase in risk-taking can be seen either as facilitation, for example by increasing explorative behaviors and socially acceptable risk-taking, or impediment, when the risks are illegal and dangerous (Duell and Steinberg, 2019). In one remarkable neuroimaging study along these lines (Chein et al., 2011), found evidence for the reward sensitivity model. The presence of another person increased activity in the ventral striatum when adolescents received rewards, as compared to a solitary reward condition. This was true for adolescents but not for adults.However, in another variant of social facilitation theory (Sanders et al., 1978), social arousal is thought to result in distraction from the task at hand, thus mostly resulting in detrimental or sub-optimal behavior. In fact, there is evidence that arousal leads to decreased cognitive control, which results in more distracted behavior in decision-making tasks (Starcke and Brand, 2012). There is also evidence that distraction accounts for typical adolescent behavior in some experimental paradigms. For instance, Dumontheil et al. (2016) demonstrated reduced reasoning abilities in adolescents when monitored by peers. Similarly, another study found that adolescents who showed poor conflict monitoring in an emotionally arousing Stroop task also turned out to be risky drivers in a driving simulator (Botdorf et al., 2017).Consequently, changes in risky choice while being observed could be the result of the motivation for social signaling, of arousal-based reward sensitive decisions, or distraction, and each of these three processes possibly has a different developmental trajectory. Merely observing an increase in risky decisions in adolescents seems insufficient to specify which underlying psychological process is most relevant.In sum, different studies have emphasized different models and found results in favor of each. This holds for paradigms when adolescents are observing others and even more for paradigms in which they are observed. These mixed results may be due to the fact that each study has used different experimental paradigms with large variations of the key variables (e.g., known risk vs. uncertainty, best friend vs. unknown peer) and most studies do not directly compare different social contexts in order to identify if they are subject to different psychological processes (but see Somerville et al., 2018). Another reason for the diversity of experimental findings, which can also be attributed to variations in key variables, is that studies likely differ in their affective content. For instance, the affective content of a study on social influence which only uses information about choices of strangers who are not currently present is fundamentally different from a study wherein social influence is examined by looking at changes in behavior in the presence of a close friend. The distinction between affectively &#8220;hot&#8221; and &#8220;cold&#8221; contexts is a useful heuristic to understand adolescent risk-taking. There is evidence that adolescents make more risky choices in &#8220;hot&#8221; contexts. Notably, reward sensitivity and distraction models explain behavior change via affect (arousal) as well (Blakemore and Robbins, 2012; Rosenbaum et al., 2018). In order to comprehend adolescent socio-emotional development, we need to better understand how affect and social processing interact and impact each other. We argue that the specificity provided by formal modeling might help to disentangle these important components in developmental research, similar to the field of computational psychiatry (Montague et al., 2012; Huys et al., 2015; Jolly and Chang, 2018).However, before further elaborating on the benefits of formal models in developmental research we first want to pay credit to the neuroscience of adolescent development. Neuroimaging studies may provide better clues to what extent different processes underlie behavior. In addition, it may be possible to generate more specific hypotheses about which psychological processes are involved based on the localization of neural activation.\nSocial Influence and Brain Development\nMost verbal models of adolescent social influence are inspired by recent findings from developmental neuroimaging. Here we will review some of those findings and indicate to what extent they support existing models. Given that neural activation is a more direct reflection of the processes underlying behavior, neuroimaging may be instrumental to identify which process is most relevant in which context.Adolescent social motivation models are supported by findings about the development of a network of brain regions associated with social cognition. This network, sometimes subsumed as the &#8220;social brain,&#8221; continues to develop during adolescence (Mills et al., 2014). The most prominent regions of this network are the temporo parietal junction (TPJ), the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), the anterior temporal cortex (ATC), and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). When reasoning about others, the social network seems more active in adolescents than in adults or children (van den Bos et al., 2011). Further, in a study by Somerville et al. (2013) observed by others resulted in increased mPFC activity in adolescents. However, activity in these regions is not unique to social processing. For instance the same study found an adolescent increase in connectivity of the mPFC with striatal brain regions, which are relevant for processing rewards. Further, the mPFC itself is also involved in basic reward processing (Harris et al., 2007; Silverman et al., 2015). Taken together, the increased mPFC activity when being observed can also be interpreted as supporting the reward sensitivity model.Neural correlates of the role of adolescent reward sensitivity in non-social contexts were recently examined in a meta-analysis (Silverman et al., 2015). This study estimated an increased likelihood of activation in adolescents within a broad range of regions associated with reward processing. These comprise the ventral and dorsal striatum, subcallosal cortex, insula, and amygdala as well as the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and the paracingulate region and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). One study found increased activity in the ventral striatum when adolescents where taking risks in a social but not in a solitary context, whereas this activity difference was not found in adults (Chein et al., 2011). These results are evidence in favor of the reward sensitivity model, but there are multiple possible interpretations. For instance, increased reward related neural activity could either be the result of altered reward perception or of an orthogonal, social value of conforming to a norm. Both social and non-social value is represented in the striatum (Ruff and Fehr, 2014); both mechanisms can lead to more risky behavior in certain tasks.Distraction models emphasize the development of the lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC) and the inter parietal sulcus, which make up the main regions of the cognitive control network. Studies based on the distraction model consistently found increased IPS activation during cognitive control in adolescents, whereas lPFC findings were mixed (Dumontheil, 2016). One study investigating the effects of social context on neural processing while performing a relational reasoning task found that adolescents recruited this cognitive control network more strongly than adults when an audience was present, while performance changed in a similar magnitude for both age groups (Dumontheil et al., 2016). This result also allows for multiple interpretations. Adolescents may be more distracted, but on the other hand it may also be that they exert more control to counteract their distraction, and thus stay on par with adult&#8217;s behavior. The fact that they exert more control could potentially be the result of an increased motivation to perform well while observed by others.In summation, we have seen that all verbal models are supported by neuroimaging research. Different models emphasize the development of different brain networks, but these networks often overlap with respect to functional and structural components. As long as a one-to-one mapping between cognitive and neural processes is not given, it is not justifiable to make the reverse inference about the presence or absence of a cognitive process purely on the basis of observed, or unobserved neural activity (Poldrack, 2006, 2011).We do not wish to discredit the existing studies on neural correlates of adolescent peer influence; On the contrary, we believe that these are excellent and well-designed neuroimaging studies. In combination with appropriate experimental control conditions, reverse inference is valid and insightful (Hutzler, 2014). However, experimentally isolating a cognitive process becomes exponentially difficult when the processes in question increase in complexity. Different attempts have been suggested to attenuate the issue, such as large scale brain decoding (Poldrack, 2011; Yarkoni et al., 2011), using functional localizers (Saxe et al., 2006), and formal modeling (Marr and Poggio, 1976; Montague et al., 2012; Stephan et al., 2015; van den Bos and Eppinger, 2016; Hauser et al., 2018). None of these strategies will completely solve the problem of reverse inference, however, each may increase our confidence in reliably identifying the neural correlates of a particular cognitive processes. This article is motivated by the advantage of formal models; in what follows, we will illustrate how verbal models of social influence in adolescence might be translated into formal ones.\nFormal Models of Social Influence\nWe here demonstrate how formal models can be used to make precise predictions of behavior, help interpret existing results, and generate experimental designs which are able to disambiguate psychological processes. We argue that formal modeling enables a precise discussion about which models are favored by experimental data and we hope to provide a starting point for future work. We focus on the specific processes of verbal models that we have identified above and translate them within one decision-making framework: expected utility theory. See Figure 1 for an overview of our mapping between verbal and formal models.What we illustrate is a first attempt to formalize verbal models about developmental change in social influence in risky decision-making. The model-space we present here is by no means exhaustive. One could translate verbal models in various ways, relying on different frameworks: for example, by using reinforcement learning (Bolenz et al., 2017).To formalize models of adolescent decision-making, we first address how risk-taking is understood within the expected utility framework in order to familiarize the reader with its&#8217; assumptions. Then, we extend the model with parameters that can be read as social motivation, reward sensitivity, and distraction. These formal models are advantageous in two ways. First, they allow to directly quantify evidence for all models relative to each other, within one experiment. Second, formal modeling aids in identifying the necessary conditions that need to be given by an experimental paradigm in order to be able to distinguish the predictions of different models. A trivial example for this is an experiment where only risk-seeking behavior is valued by peers. As we will see, in such an experiment, social motivation and reward sensitivity models make very similar predictions. However, as soon as safe behavior is valued by peers, predictions of the two models diverge.\nExpected Utility\nThe first assumption of expected utility theory is that people have a subjective experience of objective rewards. For instance, the first dollar someone ever earns is worth more to them than the hundredth. In other terms: the change in wealth from nothing to $1 feels different from the change in wealth from $99 to $100. This transformation of objectively equal values ($1 in both cases) into a subjective utility is often modeled by a power function borrowed from psychophysics (Helmholtz, 1896), where it is used to describe the non-linear relationship between subjective psychological experience of a stimulus intensity and the objective physical intensity of the stimulus:Here V denotes the objective value of a reward and &#961; determines the convexity of the utility function (Figure 2). Often times &#961; is referred to capturing &#8220;outcome&#8221; or &#8220;reward sensitivity&#8221; of an individual (Kellen et al., 2016), because this parameter modifies the subjective representation of an objective reward.In most decisions, outcomes are not certain; they occur probabilistically. The subjective utility of a probabilistic outcome is then described as:where p denotes the probability of the reward. When individuals are repeatedly presented with the same choice options, their decisions will most likely differ from one another. Consequently, we need to account for this probabilistic nature of choice in a model of behavior. To achieve this, a model for choosing between two rewards feeds the difference between reward utilities into a sigmoid function, through which we obtain an estimate of the probability that a decision maker chooses the risky option over the safe one on a given trialThe smaller &#964;, the less sensitive the decision-maker is to the expected utility differences and the more random the choice pattern appears. We now turn to examine how different models of social decision-making can be represented within this framework.\nModeling Social Influence\nIn our earlier example, we used the subjective value of objective monetary amounts as the key variable for decision-making, but there is ample evidence that people also attribute utility to social outcomes such as fairness (Fehr and Schmidt, 1999), and social status (van den Bos, 2009). Furthermore, there is evidence that humans integrate value information from social and non-social sources into a common currency when making a choice (see Ruff and Fehr, 2014, for a review). Consequently, the expected utility framework can be extended to include social rewards and represent social behavior.\nSocial Motivation\nSocial rewards, such as belonging or expected status gains, can add to the expected utility associated with a decision, because the prospects of social and non-social rewards are combined when making a choice (Ruff and Fehr, 2014). Within expected utility theory, the changed valuation of an option due to the presence of social information can be expressed as a single parameter shifting subjective utility. To illustrate, let us consider a typical experiment where there are two options, a relatively safe option and a risky option. A social signal, for instance observing that a peer chose the risky option, contributes to the utility of the risky option, while the expected value of the choice options and individual reward sensitivity remains the same (Chung et al., 2015). This can be implemented with a single additional parameter:where &#968; corresponds to the impact of social information on risky and safe choice options. We call this formal model the &#8220;symmetric social influence model.&#8221; The larger &#968; the more likely the participant is to move into the direction of the social information (see Figure 3A). It is likely that social information has asymmetric effects on behavior depending on whether social information favors risk-averse or risk-seeking behaviors. For instance, Braams et al. (2019) showed that risky advice had less impact than safe advice. This asymmetry can be captured by adding two independent parameters to the utility function, contingent on whether social information favors safe or risky choices (see Figure 3B).We call this formal model the &#8220;asymmetric social influence model.&#8221; In these social influence models, social information does not change the subjective evaluation of rewards in general, but merely provides a bonus to the socially preferred option. Note that the interpretation of &#968; depends on the specifics of the experiment. In an experiment where the participant is observed this model can be used to quantify the expected value of gaining status by taking risks. In such an experiment, &#968; might represent the additional value of signaling that one is a risk-taker, or the value of conforming to peer norms. In another experiment where the participant merely observes others, social information can reduce the participants&#8217; uncertainty about what to choose, and &#968; can be an indicator about how strongly social information is used in order to reduce uncertainty.\nReward Sensitivity\nSome developmental models suggest that in a social context, rewards are valued more by adolescents because socially induced arousal facilitates reward-processing (e.g., Chein et al., 2011). Here we focus on this key element of these models namely a change in reward sensitivity due to a social context. Reward sensitivity is also a basic feature of simple expected utility models; it is governed by parameter &#961;(see Eq. 1). This parameter has already been used to characterize individual and developmental differences in risk attitudes (e.g., Blankenstein et al., 2016; van den Bos and Hertwig, 2017). In order to capture changes in reward sensitivity in a social context, one can add a parameter the &#8220;reward sensitivity&#8221; part of the utility function:Henceforth we will call this model the &#8220;reward sensitivity model.&#8221; The larger &#969; the more risk-seeking an individual becomes (see Figures 2, 3C). Therefore, the parameter &#969; changes the subjective interpretation of rewards in general. In our reading of verbal reward sensitivity models, &#969; will never be smaller than 0 given that it is the expectation that is there is an increase, not a decrease, in reward sensitivity due to arousal. This reward sensitivity model aims to capture the main mechanism by which dual-process or imbalance models are assumed to modulate social influence. It is not thought to be a representation of the full set of psychological processes associated with dual systems models.\nDistraction\nOther work emphasizes that social situations are distracting, especially for adolescents (Dumontheil, 2016; Dumontheil et al., 2016; Botdorf et al., 2017; Breiner et al., 2018). For choices that are value- or preference-based, it is hard to judge whether a decision results from distraction or inattentiveness; there is no objectively correct benchmark to evaluate correct and incorrect responses. However, formal modeling provides the means of unmasking stochasticity in choice which is unique to social contexts and could otherwise be falsely interpreted as an increase or decrease in risk-taking. In decision models, stochasticity is often captured by a &#8220;trembling hand&#8221; choice rule (Loomes et al., 2002). This rule modifies the choice function by adding a fixed probability that the individual does not use expected utility to guide their choice, but rather chooses randomly. To capture this increase in distraction we can estimate how this probability of choosing randomly increases in the social context:where 0 < &#950; < 1 and a larger &#950;indicates more random behavior. We will refer to this equation as the &#8220;social distraction&#8221; model. This model assumes, that in a social context, differences between prospects become less important in determining behavior. Note that more random behavior means an increase in risk-taking when one would normally show risk averse behavior, and vice versa (see Figure 3D).\nModel Predictions\nThese formalizations of the different psychological processes involved in social influence make distinguishable predictions (Figure 3). Only the social influence models clearly predict that behavior will shift in a way that is dependent on the social information content (e.g., other advice is safe or risky), or the beliefs of the subject (e.g., believe the norm is safe or risky). In contrast, for reward sensitivity or distraction models, the social context has a unidirectional main effect on behavior. The fact that the models can generate different patterns of behavior is in itself no proof that these models are actually distinguishable and suitable for model comparison. For this we need to run simulations as well as model and parameter recovery analyses in the context of specific experimental settings (Palminteri et al., 2017), which we will do below.\nMethods\n\nSimulation Study and Model Quality\nTo assess the quality of our formal models, we first simulated decisions on a set of risky gambles with varying expected value, based on all outlined models. We explicitly included the standard expected utility model without any social parameters (Eq. 2), to control for the possibility that expected utility is itself flexible enough to describe a wide range of choices. We simulated decisions in a classic economic paradigm that requires repeated choices between a probabilistic lottery with a high reward and a non-probabilistic small reward. Lotteries combined values 8, 20, and 50 (Arbitrary Units) with winning probabilities 0.125, 0.25, 0.375, 0.5, 0.675, and 0.75. The safe reference always had an expected value of 5. These values resemble those used in Blankenstein et al. (2016). Social information provided in the simulations consisted of the choices of one risk seeking subject in Blankenstein et al. (2016). For each social influence model, agents were divided into 12 different groups based on the distributions used to sample the parameters &#968; or which represent behavior change in the face of social information in a given model (see Table 1 for details). Reward sensitivity, &#961; and temperature, &#964; were sampled from the same distributions for all individuals, with sufficient statistics &#961;&#8764;N(&#956; = 0.4,&#963; = 0.3) and &#964;&#8764;N(&#956; = 0.8,&#963; = 0.1). For each group and model, we simulated 50 individuals, resulting in a total of 5&#8727;12&#8727;50 simulated subjects that responded to 432 choice problems, 144 of which contained risk seeking social information, 144 risk averse social information which was generated by inverting the choices in the risk seeking condition and 144 featured no social information. To summarize, we modeled the behavior of subjects over a range of variables of risk- and social preferences and simulated how they would respond to different choice problems in the presence of social information. We then investigated to what extent we could correctly identify the underlying data generating models, by fitting all models to the responses we generated.\nModel and Parameter Recovery\nWe evaluated all models with regard to their fit to the data we had previously generated. This enabled us to check whether our analysis was suitable to correctly identify the data generating model. That is, if successful, model fitting and comparison would indicate that the best fitting model was the one we used to generate the data. Only then can one confidently use these models to test specific hypotheses (Palminteri et al., 2017). We judged the fit of all five models given the simulated data by consulting the deviance information criterion (DIC). Lower DIC values indicate better model fit. The rule of thumb cautiously introduced by Spiegelhalter et al. (2002) is to treat DIC values higher than 3&#8211;7 relative to a better fitting reference model to be considerably less supported by the data.It is possible that different parameter values of a model result in the same pattern of behavior. To rule out the possibility that our models are &#8220;sloppy&#8221; in that respect, we correlated the generative parameter values with the mean of the posterior parameter distribution which we obtained by inverting the generative model on itself. A high correlation between the simulation parameters and the parameter estimates obtained from inverting the data generating model on itself is indicative that we can approximate the &#8220;true&#8221; parameter values well, when inverting the model on human choices.\nFitting Hierarchical Bayesian Models of Social Influence\nWe formulated the models introduced above in a hierarchical Bayesian way. This was advantageous because individual parameters could be pulled from group specific hyper distributions, which made us more sensitive to identify differences between groups and reduced outliers that often occur using frequentist fitting procedures. In our case, we drew parameters form hyper distributions for each group separately, specifying the same prior for each age group (graphical model and priors in the supplement). Non-centered parametrization was used to effectively sample subject-level parameters from the hyper distributions (Betancourt and Girolami, 2013). We obtained posterior parameter distributions using the No-U-Turn-Sampler implemented in Stan (Carpenter et al., 2017). For each model, we used 6,000 iterations of four parallel chains each and no thinning. The first 1,000 samples were discarded as warmup.\nResults\nThe results of our analyses indicate a good model and parameter recovery (see Figure 4). However, not all models performed equally well. While all Markov chains converged as indicated by the Gelman Rubin statistic (Gelman and Rubin, 1992) and most of the parameters could be recovered reliably, the trembling hand error term &#950; of the social distraction model was not recovered very well (0.24 on the diagonal). Additionally, &#950; was negatively correlated with the temperature parameter of the choice function (r = &#8722;0.6). Functional attribution to either of these parameters should be made with caution in case the social distraction model is best descriptive of the data.\nApplying the Models Synthesizes Seemingly Divergent Experimental Results\nHaving established that our proposed formal models and their parameters were recoverable, we applied the formal social influence, reward sensitivity and distraction models to data of two published studies, in order to quantify to what extent the studies support either model. Both studies investigated social influence when adolescents observed social information as they chose between different monetary lotteries (Blankenstein et al., 2016; Braams et al., 2019). Using our formalized versions of models on social influence in adolescent risk taking, we investigated how well either study supported social information, reward sensitivity or distraction models. Both studies provided the participants with safety- and risk-promoting social information. The studies investigated how explicit information about another person&#8217;s choices changed risk-taking behavior in monetary lotteries and how this change in risk-taking was related to the participants&#8217; developmental stage. The combined age range of both studies was 10&#8211;26. The first study focused on adolescent reward sensitivity and reported that social impact on risk-taking decreases with age (Blankenstein et al., 2016). The other focused more on adolescent social motivation and found that social impact for safe behavior was strongest in adolescence (Braams et al., 2019). Notably, these two studies used very similar paradigms but report results in line with different verbal models of adolescent risk-taking in social contexts. Below we will re-analyze both studies and show that formal model comparison can synthesize these seemingly divergent explanations. Our re-analysis was restricted to these two studies because these studies are so similar which made a straightforward showcase for the benefits of formal modeling.\nAnalysis\nIn both datasets, we compared the formal models via DIC. The experimental paradigms included risky choices where the probability was known, and ambiguous choices where the exact probabilities where not known. For sake of simplicity, we have currently ignored the ambiguous trial types in the main manuscript. However, we believe that the discussion of risk, ambiguity or even experience-based choice in relation to adolescent risk-taking is very important, but beyond the scope of the present paper [but see Rosenbaum et al. (2018) for review]. Thus, in this articles&#8217; Supplementary Material we report how we adjusted the formal models to include an ambiguity attitude parameter (Tymula et al., 2012; van den Bos and Hertwig, 2017) and repeated all analyses with expected utility and ambiguity models. The main results of the model comparison remained the same (see Supplementary&#8201;&#8201;Material).For inference on age trends in the best fitting models&#8217; parameters, we used Bayesian general linear models, implemented in the rstanarm package (Stan Development Team, 2018) utilizing rstanarm&#8217;s default priors. The age predictor was binned to represent pre- (age  19) groups. To test linear and quadratic age trends we constructed orthogonal regressors using R&#8217;s poly function. We subsequently inverted the quadratic age predictor, so that the beta estimates were more positive, when its contribution to the dependent variable increases. For each regression, we ran 3 chains with 30,000 samples each and set a warmup of 1,000 samples. Convergence of the chains was inspected by consulting stan&#8217;s implementation of the Gelman Rubin statistic (Gelman and Rubin, 1992). Generally, we report the mean of the posterior and the two-sided 95% credible intervals (CI) around each mean. We treat the contribution of a predictor as negligible if the credible interval of the regression weights includes a zero.\nExperiment 1: Reanalysis of \nBlankenstein et al. (2016) tested n = 157 participants aged 10&#8211;26. In this study, participants were asked to choose between a risky gamble and a safe option on 216 trials. In order to investigate susceptibility to peer influence, Blankenstein et al. (2016) programmed a virtual agent very prone to risk-taking and showed its choices to the participants prior to their choice in half of the trials. Note that this agent was very risk-taking on average, but sometimes chose the safe option as well. The probabilities and values associated with the gambles were presented as wheels of fortune (Ernst et al., 2004) and were the same as the ones we used for our simulations. A full combination of gain values and probabilities resulted in 24 unique trials. The authors reported an overall increase in risky choices in the social condition; the increase was most pronounced in youngest participants and linearly diminished with age. The original analysis was motivated by the reward sensitivity model. The study design and their model-based analysis focused on a change in risk attitude as measured by the reward sensitivity parameter, &#961;, which we introduced earlier. However, their reported result is, in principle, consistent with all three verbal models of risk-taking under consideration in this paper. Our reanalysis goes beyond the original analysis as we specifically designed formal models to compare competing models about the nature of social influence during adolescence within the same task.\nResults\nModel comparison via DIC identified the asymmetric social influence model as best fitting (Figure 5B). Reward sensitivity and distraction models performed considerably worse in comparison. The best fitting model replicated the behavior of participants with great accuracy (Figure 5A). All age groups made more risky decisions when social information was risky, and made more safe choices when social information was safe. Strikingly, and contrary to our expectations given the original article, all participants showed a greater social influence when being confronted with safety-promoting social information (Figure 5C). As a next step, we performed Bayesian generalized linear regressions using age and quadratic age as predictor of the social model parameter estimates. We ran separate regression analysis on &#968; risk and &#968; safe, treating them as separate dependent variables. We found that the older the participants, the less they took risky advice [&#946;AgeLin = &#8722;1.5, CI = (&#8722;1.9, &#8722;1.2)]. Older participants additionally took safe advice more often [&#946;AgeLin = 1.4, CI = (0.9, 2.0)] as compared to younger participants. We also found adolescent decrease in taking risky advice as indicated by a negative quadratic contribution of age for following risky [&#946;AgeQuad = &#8722;0.6 CI = (&#8722;0.9, &#8722;0.2)] but no adolescent effects on taking safe advice [&#946;AgeQuad = 0.5 CI = (&#8722;0.0, 1.1)]. In sum, participants of all ages were influenced by both safe and risky social information. In agreement with the original author&#8217;s conclusions, we found that the impact of risky social information was strongest in youngest participants. Crucially however, safe social information had an even stronger impact than risky social information in all age groups, a conclusion which was not noted in original analyses.\nExperiment 2: Reanalysis of \nIn this experiment n = 99 participants aged 12&#8211;22 chose between risky and safe gambles on 300 trials. Similar to Blankenstein et al. (2016), the authors were interested in the impact of social information on risky choice across development and presented subjects with computer generated decisions that participants believed were choices from other participants of the study. Other than in Blankenstein et al. (2016), risky and safe options were both gambles with equal probabilities: there was no sure option to choose from. In both gambles, it was either possible to win a low or a high reward. Risky gambles could result in either very low or very high rewards. For the risky options, the difference between the high and low rewards varied from $3.63 to $5.51. For safer options, there was less to lose as the difference was between $0.06 and $1. The probability of winning the high reward varied with a step size of 10% from 40% up to 90%. The lotteries were presented as colored bars, with color proportions indicating the winning probability. The authors concluded that participants followed risky and safe choices of peers and that adolescents use safe more than risky social information. Such a result speaks for social motivation models. However, as seen above: drawing conclusions about mechanisms is hard without a formal model comparison. In order to be able to apply formal model comparison here, the models were adapted to reflect the conceptualization of risk as the variability in outcomes (Weber et al., 2004) used in Braams et al. (2019). Hence, the utility of one choice option in this re-analysis is described as:while the social extensions to this model remained the same.\nResults\nModel comparison via DIC again indicated, as in Blankenstein et al. (2016), that the asymmetric social influence model fit the overall behavior best (Figure 6B). Again, reward sensitivity and distraction models had considerably worse fit than the models which assume that social impact depends on the content of social information. Simulating data under the obtained posterior distributions again revealed that our models could predict the participant choices well (Figure 6A).As before, most participants put higher weight on safety-promoting social information than on risky social information (Figure 6C). To judge the statistical relevance of this pattern, we performed Bayesian generalized linear regressions, again using age and quadratic age as predictors while treating &#968; risk and &#968; safe as separate dependent variables. We found that linear age was not a good predictor for using risky [&#946;AgeLin = 0.0, CI = (&#8722;0.2, 0.3)] nor safe advice [&#946;AgeLin = &#8722;0.2 CI = (&#8722;0.4, 0.0)]. However, quadratic age trends were substantial for both risky [&#946;AgeQuad = &#8722;0.5 CI = (&#8722;0.7, &#8722;0.3)] and safe advice [&#946;AgeQuad = 0.6 CI = (0.4, 0.8)], implying that adolescents used risky social information less and safe social information more to guide their choice. In sum we find that safe social information has a greater impact on choice than risky information, especially so during adolescence. Again, model comparison provides evidence that all age groups differentially assign weight to risky and safe social information.\nDiscussion\nIt is a widespread assumption that adolescents take risks more frequently and are more sensitive to social information than members of other age groups. Why this is the case, and in which situations this occurs remain open questions despite extensive theory development and empirical research. Several verbal models of adolescent decision-making have identified elements that may play a role in increased risk-seeking behavior. Some point to high social motivation as the principle driving force of adolescent decision-making. Others emphasize reward sensitivity or increased arousal in social situations; yet others have focused more on diminished cognitive control and increased distraction in social contexts. Most of the current experimental evidence is consistent with more than one of these explanations, resulting in a handful of plausible verbal models that explain social influence in adolescent risk-taking well. Further progress requires the systematic testing of models against each other, within different social contexts (Pfeifer and Allen, 2016; van den Bos and Eppinger, 2016). With this goal in mind, we translated verbal models of adolescent social decision-making into formal models (c.f. Figure 1), which make distinguishable quantitative predictions (c.f. Figure 3). Using simulations and Bayesian model inversion, we first demonstrated that these models can be recovered and thus can be tested against each other using a single experimental setting (c.f. Figure 4). We then reanalyzed two published studies investigating the development of social influence, and showed how the model-based approach can synthesize the results of two studies on social observation (c.f. Figures 5, 6). Here we will discuss the implications of our findings regarding the re-analyzes and, more importantly, the general applications and limitations of the modeling approach. Additionally, we provide specific suggestions for research on social influence in adolescence.\nAdolescents Are Influenced More by Safe Social Information Than Risky Social Information\nEven though the reanalyzed studies (Blankenstein et al., 2016; Braams et al., 2019) share a similar paradigm, they are different in terms of stimuli (wheels of fortune vs. bars), reward magnitudes (high vs. low), choices (risky/safe vs. low/high risk), and the source of social information (peer vs. peer/computer/non-peer). This resulted in considerable differences in the aggregate behavior of the subjects (Figures 5A, 6A). However, applying our models yielded similarities between the two studies which were not easily gleaned from the original articles. First, we showed that in both experiments, participants of all ages took safety and risk promoting social information into account. This is consistent with the original interpretation of Braams et al. (2019), but not clear from the original analysis of Blankenstein et al. (2016). Second, model comparison and the parameter estimates of both re-analyses indicated that safer social information consistently weighs stronger than risky information, especially for adolescents. We can therefore conclude that, when risk aversion is valued by peers, social information can induce safety-promoting behaviors in adolescents. This is worth emphasizing because assuming that adolescent decision-making is maladaptive or flawed is unhelpful in designing social interventions. Restrictive public interventions solely based on that notion have been at best only mildly successful in making adolescents &#8220;better&#8221; decision-makers in the past (Albert and Steinberg, 2011; Rosenbaum et al., 2018). Mobilizing the finding that social information can favorize safe decision-making could lead to better interventions and perhaps reduce dangerous real-world risk-taking. Taken together, our results confirm a positive outlook on adolescent decision-making and add further evidence that adolescent social motivation can be used for the good (Perkins et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2017; Telzer et al., 2018; van Hoorn et al., 2018). However, it is important to note that our conclusions are limited to paradigms where social information is passively observed; it may well be very different when applied to data of experiments where the participant was observed by others.\nComputational Modeling Can Inform Experimental Design\nIn principle, formal models make it possible to quantify social impact in various contexts and increase the specificity of a given hypothesis, but they are no panacea. Models require well-designed experiments: the conclusions that can be drawn from model parameter estimates and model comparison depend on the experimental paradigm. For example, as previously noted, experiments where the participant is observed could lead both to unspecific arousal and also to specific social messaging by the participant (e.g., signaling they are a risk-taker to gain status). Both phenomena can lead to an increase in risk-taking, and this behavior can be consistent with all of our formal models. In order to be able to draw informative conclusions about social mechanisms, experiments need control conditions where adolescents can achieve social status by demonstrating safe behavior. Similarly, an experiment where participants only observe the risky decisions of others is by design unable to generate support for a social sensitivity model, and would likely furnish behavioral data consistent with all models, verbal or formal. The relationship between formal model parameters and experimental elements additionally allows for an unambiguous specification of the conditions needed to distinguish between models, fostering better experimental design. Model simulations can be used a priori to show whether the specific implementation of a proposed experiment can distinguish between models1. In other terms, although formal models cannot compensate for poorly designed experiments, they significantly contribute to the development of experimental designs that generate testable hypotheses.\nComputational Models Can Help Interpret Neuroimaging Results\nAll theories about the nature of adolescent decision-making are supported by neurodevelopmental research using techniques like (f)MRI. However, the often-used practice of reverse inference from observed neural activity about the engagement, or the absence of a specific cognitive process is problematic (Poldrack, 2006, 2011). Formal models are helpful in order to overcome some logical fallacies associated with reverse inference (Poldrack, 2011). When using formal modeling, the engagement of cognitive processes is quantified by comparing plausible process models which are subsequently fitted to observed behaviors. In the example of expected utility models, used throughout this article, formal modeling provides insight into the otherwise hidden process of subjective utility computation. Crucially, model comparison happens before regressing the winning models&#8217; parameter estimates to measured neuronal activity. Inference can thus be made more rigorously, avoiding logical aberrations such as assuming that activity in the mPFC solely equates social motivation, whereas this activity could also reflect reward sensitivity. Additionally, the model-based approach helps the understanding of developmental processes (van den Bos et al., 2017). In summation, computational modeling is useful to attenuate some issues associated with reverse inference and can lead to more detailed, process-based insights about cognitive development.\nLimitations and Future Directions\nNaturally the current article is not free of caveats, some of which we will discuss in the following section. Most strikingly, our results only apply to two paradigms in which people observe behavior, and thus we cannot conclude that this pattern generalizes to behavior where participants are being observed. Real-life decisions are additionally more complex than the decisions in the binary choice tasks we have highlighted here. In the real world it is rare to be presented with accurate information about outcomes and probabilities associated with choices; there are usually multiple sources of uncertainty (Bach and Dolan, 2012). Although beyond the scope of the current article, there are several computational frameworks that aim at understanding behavior under different types of uncertainty. This can take different forms such as ambiguity extensions of expected utility (Tymula et al., 2012; van den Bos and Hertwig, 2017) or Bayesian decision frameworks, which assume that social influence is stronger when individuals are more uncertain (Toelch and Dolan, 2015). There has been much attention on the distinction between risk and ambiguity in the literature; both datasets reanalyzed here also originally tested age trends in attitudes toward ambiguity. We did not focus on the ambiguous trials in the main article, as our focus was on formalizing verbal models. However, there is reason to expect that ambiguity increases social influence (Toelch and Dolan, 2015) which is why we repeated the same analysis using ambiguity extensions and classical expected utility models (see Supplementary Material). This did not affect the conclusions of our model comparison. We encourage further studies that investigate if the social parameters of the models differ between risky and uncertain or ambiguous choices. Of additional note is that in real life there is not only uncertainty about what to choose, but real-life knowledge of probabilities and outcomes is acquired dynamically through experience (Hertwig and Erev, 2009). Learning in dynamic environments can be modeled within the reinforcement learning framework (Dayan and Niv, 2008), which can be adapted similarly to the models we proposed here in order to comprehend the development of social influence in experience-based tasks (Behrens et al., 2008; Biele et al., 2011; Diaconescu et al., 2014; Bolenz et al., 2017; Rodriguez Buritica et al., 2019).As briefly mentioned affect is another important modulator of adolescent risk-taking. In affectively arousing (i.e., &#8220;hot&#8221;) contexts, adolescents make risky decisions more often than in less arousing (i.e., &#8220;cold&#8221;) contexts (Figner et al., 2009; Defoe et al., 2015; Laube and van den Bos, 2016; Rosenbaum et al., 2018). In fact, social facilitation theory as well as reward sensitivity and distraction models all imply that social behavior is influenced by arousal, which itself is often understood as affectively hot. Therefore, research on social influence needs to closely examine the interaction between affect and social processing. &#8220;Cold&#8221; social situations might be where the participant is merely observing others and &#8220;hot&#8221; situations might be those where the participant is being observed or interacts with others. However, we believe that a one-to-one mapping between social and affective contexts seems overly simplistic. In the future, it will be interesting to see how different processes like reward sensitivity, social motivation or distraction have different weights in different affective contexts and how strong affect mediates behavior change. From our current understanding of the literature, &#8220;hot&#8221; contexts might be best described with reward sensitivity or distraction models whereas behavior in &#8220;cold&#8221; contexts might be better described by models emphasizing social motivation. Careful experimental design in combination with formal models may delineate the importance of each process in explaining developmental changes in peer influence.\nSummary and Conclusion\nAdolescents are often thought to be excessive risk-takers, especially in social contexts. Since adolescents&#8217; risky decisions constitute a major health hazard and can have long term consequences, several attempts have been made to understand the determinants of adolescent social risk-taking. Plausible verbal models of social influence in adolescent risk-taking have been formulated, but it is difficult to identify which of the proposed processes determine adolescent behavior in a particular social situation. We argue that this is because verbal models make unspecific predictions: a broad range of observations is consistent with one, or even several, verbal models. Here we make a first attempt to specify models of social influence in adolescent risk-taking by connecting the developmental literature to theories of social psychology and representing them as simple formal models. Reanalyzing two published studies on social influence in risky choice yields that adolescents, like adults, are sensitive to the quality of social information and carefully integrate it into private decisions. In both studies, safe social information had a stronger influence than risky information on adolescents&#8217; decisions. These results add further evidence that adolescent social sensitivity can result in safe, health promoting behavior. Investigating if and how this pattern generalizes to other contexts for instance when adolescents are being observed, will be most insightful. We hope this article encourages further work on isolating the building blocks of developmental models, through harnessing the specificity of formal modeling and model comparison.\nAuthor\u2019s Note\nSC is a pre-doctoral fellow of the International Max Planck Research School on Computational Methods in Psychiatry and Aging Research (IMPRS COMP2PSYCH).

It is a measure of the frequency with which an average article in a journal has been cited in a particular year. The IF of a journal, computed annually by the Science Citation Index (SCI), is the average number of times that articles published in that journal in two consecutive years are cited during the following year. It has been widely used as an index for evaluating the quality of publications in scientific journals [1, 2]. Although it has been criticized for various weaknesses [3&#8211;7], the IF does provide an objective measure of the citation rate of the average published article in a specific journal, and it has not been replaced by any other index of rating the quality of journals.To give a further basis for the discussion on the significance of the IF, the IF of rheumatology journals of 2008 as well as those of the past 10&#160;years was serially analyzed and compared with that from other fields given the relative paucity of information in this area.\nMethods\nFor the past 10&#160;years (1999&#8211;2008), the IFs published by the ISI in the SCI&#8212;Journal Citation Report (JCR) [8] were descriptively analyzed. All journals listed in the 2008 SCI under the subheading &#8220;Rheumatology&#8221; were included. For each journal, the IF for the years 1999&#8211;2008 (if available), language (i.e., English, multiple languages (including English), or non-English) and country of origin (according to the item of &#8220;Journal Country/Territory&#8221; of each journal in the Journal Citation Report) were determined. The aggregate IF and median IF of each category were also extracted from the JCR each year (only available since 2003).Additionally, all categories of scientific journals in the &#8220;JCR Science Edition&#8221; and categories related to clinical medicine (so-called clinical medicine journals listed under the following subheadings: Allergy; Andrology; Anesthesiology; Cardiac & cardiovascular system; Clinical neurology; Critical care medicine; Dentistry, oral surgery & medicine; Dermatology; Emergency medicine; Endocrinology & metabolism; Gastroenterology & hepatology; Geriatrics & gerontology; Hematology; Infectious diseases; Medicine, general and internal; Obstetrics & gynecology; Oncology; Ophthalmology; Orthopedics; Otorhinolaryngology; Pediatrics; Peripheral vascular disease; Psychiatry; Psychology; Radiology, nuclear medicine & medical imaging; Rehabilitation; Respiratory system; Rheumatology; Surgery; Transplantation; Tropical medicine; Urology & nephrology) were also analyzed with regard to changes in the ranking of the top 50% rheumatology journals (according to the IF in 2008), as well as to the ranking of the aggregate and median IF of rheumatology journals over the past 10&#160;years.\nResults\n\nGeneral data\nTwenty-two journals in rheumatology were analyzed according to the 2008 JCR Science Edition (Table&#160;1). Among the 22 journals, 20 were in English; one was in German, and the other one was in &#8220;multiple languages&#8221;.

Only five journals had their IFs decreased, with a median level of &#8722;14.1% (ranging &#8722;3.8 to &#8722;64.3%). Among all the 22 journals, the mean and median level of increase in IF from 1999 (or the first year of IF documentation) to 2008 were 233.9% and 66.5%, respectively.\nJournals in English language from USA and Europe\nFor the journals in the English language, the mean IF of those originating from the USA was higher than that from Europe before 2002. Since 2003, however, the mean IF of European journals has begun to catch up with that of USA journals. Most of the 12 non-USA journals in English originated from European countries, except one from Canada (&#8220;Journal of Rheumatology&#8221;). If we include this journal and compare the IF of English journals from the USA and that from non-USA countries, the results are similar (Fig.&#160;1).Fig.&#160;1Comparisons of the IFs of rheumatology journals from 1999 to 2008 in the English language. a Between USA and European countries; b between USA and non-USA countriesThe mean and median increase of IF in 2008 from 1999 or the first year with IF documentation were higher in non-USA journals than in USA journals [1.426&#160;&#177;&#160;1.471 vs. 1.185&#160;&#177;&#160;1.896, 1.096 (range &#8722;0.551 to +5.220) vs. 0.988 (range &#8722;0.267 to +5.455)]. The median percentage of increase of IF in 2008 from 1999 or the first year with IF documentation was higher in non-USA journals than in USA journals [80.0% (range &#8722;10.9 to +1079.2%) vs. 50.1% (range &#8722;36.5 to +2457.2%)].\nEffect of review articles\nAmong the 20 journals in the English language, 4 journals publish almost exclusively reviews rather than original papers (so-called review-journals). These are &#8220;Best Practice & Research in Clinical Rheumatology&#8221;, &#8220;Current Opinion in Rheumatology&#8221;, &#8220;Rheumatic Disease Clinics of North America&#8221;, and &#8220;Nature Clinical Practice Rheumatology&#8221;. Compared with the other 16 journals that primarily publish original papers, the &#8220;review-journals&#8221; showed more increase in their IFs. The mean and median increase of IF in 2008 from the lowest level was 2.492 vs. 1.296 and 2.256 vs. 0.944, respectively. The mean and median percentage of increase of IF in 2008 from the lowest level was 898.4 vs. 129.4% and 568.2 vs. 90.2%.\nRanking among clinical medicine journals and all scientific journals\nSince 2003, the &#8220;category data&#8221; of journals of each discipline has been available, including total citation, aggregate IF, and median IF. There were 170 categories in 2003 rising to 173 categories in 2008. The aggregate IF and the median IF of rheumatology journals ranked 12&#8211;19 and 17&#8211;31 among these categories through these years, respectively.

The ranking of these two journals among clinical medicine journals and among all the scientific journals remained roughly stable or kept consistently rising within the last 10&#160;years.\nDiscussion\nThe reliability of this IF is questionable [3&#8211;7]. For example, a journal&#8217;s IF, derived from citations to all articles in a journal, cannot tell the quality of any specific research article, nor of the quality of the work of author; review articles are heavily cited and increase the IF of journals. Moreover, there are numerous ways by which the IF can be manipulated. However, since so far there is no alternative, IFs are nowadays used as an important indicator for scientific quality of journals in specific subject categories [9].The current study analyzed the change in IFs of rheumatology journals in the last 10&#160;years. For the majority of these journals, the IF shows a gradual increase. This is consistent with trends in other fields [10]. Possible reasons for the increase in the IF of scientific journals include the increasing number of references per published article nowadays, modifications in the relative frequency of publication of review articles vs. original research articles, and the availability of full text of articles on the Internet [11]. The IF of the only non-English journal in rheumatology, &#8220;Aktuelle Rhematologie&#8221;, remains at the bottom throughout this 10-year period. This is in part due to bias against non-English journals noted by ISI [12, 13].Since 2003 when the &#8220;category data&#8221; in journals of each discipline became available, the aggregated IF of rheumatology journals has stably remained within the top 30% and top 15% of categories related to clinical medicine and all scientific journals, respectively. This indicates that rheumatology is one of the active fields in research [12].The most important finding in the current study is that, among the rheumatology journals in the English language, the IF of journals originating from European countries has gradually caught up with that originating from the USA. This phenomenon is different from what occurs in many other fields of medicine, e.g., nephrology and cardiology, and it also contrasts with some previous reports stating that journals from the USA generally show higher IF levels than journals from Europe [14]. This may be partially attributed to the citing behavior which favors journals from the USA in some fields, i.e., studies originating in the USA rarely cite research from other nations, while European researchers tend to cite more frequently paper from the other side of the Atlantic [14, 15]. Despite such bias, endeavor by the editorial boards of many European rheumatology journals is crucial for the increase in journals&#8217; IF.The current study also observed that &#8220;review-journals&#8221; have more rapid increase in IFs than those publishing original papers. This is consistent with findings in other fields since reviews tend to be cited more frequently [9, 12].In conclusion, over the past 10&#160;years, rheumatology journals showed a general increase in IF and rheumatology remains a leading discipline in clinical medicine and all scientific categories. For journals in the English language, those from Europe had an even higher increase in IF than those from the USA.", "pmid": "20508939", "title": "The impact factor of rheumatology journals: an analysis of 2008 and the recent 10&#160;years", "journal_title": "Rheumatology International", "authors": "Min Chen;Ming-Hui Zhao;Cees G.

After 4 decades of existence, there is substantial experience with the AUS. Today AUS is most commonly placed for postprostatectomy stress urinary incontinence. Only a small proportion of urologists routinely place AUS. In a survey in 2005, only 4% of urologists were considered high-volume AUS implanters, performing >20 per year. Globally, ~11,500 AUSs are placed annually. Over 400 articles have been published regarding the outcomes of AUS, with a wide variance in success rates ranging from 61% to 100%. Generally speaking, the AUS has good long-term outcomes, with social continence rates of ~79% and high patient satisfaction usually between 80% and 90%. Despite good outcomes, a substantial proportion of patients, generally ~25%, will require revision surgery, with the rate of revision increasing with time. Complications requiring revision include infection, urethral atrophy, erosion, and mechanical failure. Most infections are gram-positive skin flora. Urethral atrophy and erosion lie on a spectrum resulting from the same problem, constant urethral compression. However, these two complications are managed differently. Mechanical failure is usually a late complication occurring on average later than infection, atrophy, or erosions. Various techniques may be used during revisions, including cuff relocation, downsizing, transcorporal cuff placement, or tandem cuff placement. Patient satisfaction does not appear to be affected by the need for revision as long as continence is restored. Additionally, AUS following prior sling surgery has comparable outcomes to primary AUS placement. Several new inventions are on the horizon, although none have been approved for use in the US at this point.", "body": "Introduction\nUrinary incontinence is a significant quality of life issue affecting a large proportion of the population.1 It is estimated that ~22.6 million men are affected by urinary incontinence and 8.2 million have moderate to severe urinary incontinence.2 Pure stress urinary incontinence (SUI) accounts for only a subset (12.5%) of these patients, yet it remains a substantial and growing problem, especially in the postprostatectomy setting. The artificial urinary sphincter (AUS), which has evolved over many years, has become a safe and reliable treatment for SUI and is currently the gold standard. The first description of an AUS dates back to 19473; however, the modern era of sphincters began in 1983 with the release of the AMS 800 (American Medical Systems, Minnetonka, MN, USA; Figure 1).4,5 The AUS is composed of silicone and consists of an inflatable narrow backed cuff, a pressure-regulating balloon (PRB), and a control unit that consists of a deflating pump, a refill resistor, and deactivating button. The AUS has not undergone any significant changes except for the addition of a 3.5 cm cuff introduced in 2009.6,7 After 4 decades of existence, there is substantial experience with the AUS. This article focuses on current perspectives regarding its use today.\nDevice\nThe AUS consists of three separate components whose tubing must be connected using connectors provided within the AMS accessory kit. The occlusive cuff ranges from 3.5 cm to 11 cm and most commonly is placed circumferentially at the bulbar urethra. The circumference of the urethra determines the cuff size. In certain situations, it is placed more distally as in transcorporal approaches. The cuff can even be placed at the bladder neck in rare instances, although this approach requires more extensive retropubic surgical dissection. The width of all cuff sizes when deflated is 2 cm. AMS introduced the narrow backed cuff in 19875,8 in an attempt to decrease the rates of reoperation. The cuff may be coated with InhibiZone (American Medical Systems), which was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2007, although presently there are no data showing that InhibiZone reduces infection rates.The PRB transmits pressure to the occlusive cuff and comes in six pressure ranges from 41 cmH2O to 100 cmH2O in increments of 10 cmH2O. The most commonly used PRB pressure range is 61&#8211;70 cmH2O. The goal of pressure regulation is to provide the lowest amount of pressure that is sufficient for continence. Excessive pressure will increase ischemia to the urethral segment being occluded and may lead to urethral atrophy and erosion. The PRB may be placed in the space of Retzius, in a submuscular location,9 or via a counter incision in a preperitoneal space. Some favor placement of the PRB in a high submuscular location, giving comparable functional outcomes in comparison to traditional placement within the space of Retzius, while avoiding associated complications of the latter and facilitating PRB placement in reoperative cases with a hostile abdomen.10The final component is the control unit or pump and consists of two parts. The lower part is a bulb that the patient squeezes to transfer fluid out of the compressive cuff to the PRB allowing micturition. The upper part contains the resistor valves and deactivation button. In men, the pump is placed within a subdartos pouch within the scrotum where it can be easily accessed by the patient. Proper manipulation of the pump requires a certain degree of manual dexterity by the patient, which should be assessed preoperatively.11\nIndications\nThe AUS is an effective treatment for intrinsic sphincter deficiency in men resulting from various etiologies, which may include prostate cancer treatment, transurethral resection of prostate, neurologic disease, trauma, or congenital anomalies. Prior to 1985, a significant proportion (17%&#8211;50%) of AUSs were placed for neurologic disease.12 However since 1985, postprostatectomy incontinence (PPI) has been the most common indication, representing 39% to 69% of AUS placed through 2005.8,12 Indications for spinal cord injury are relatively narrow as thoracolumbar spinal cord injuries resulting in intrinsic sphincter deficiency are relatively rare. Most AUSs placed for spinal cord disease are in the pediatric population with myelodysplasia. Women currently account for 20 per year.12Traditionally, a waiting period of at least 1 year following prostate cancer treatment prior to placing an AUS has been suggested. However, more recent expert opinion agrees that an AUS may be placed as early as 6 months following radical prostatectomy (RP), if SUI is severe, bothersome to the patient, and not improving with conservative treatment.11 On the other hand, if there is ongoing improvement in SUI even 12 months after RP it is up to the surgeon&#8217;s discretion to delay surgical management of SUI. A cystoscopy prior to placement of an AUS is traditionally advised to look for any underlying urethral pathology that may complicate AUS placement or that may put the AUS at risk of subsequent damage. For example, up to 32% of patients have been found to have a vesicourethral anastomotic stricture on cystoscopy following RP.15 Vesicourethral anastomotic strictures should be stable prior to AUS placement.\nOutcomes\nThere are more than 400 articles that have been published regarding outcomes of the AUS; however, most of the literature are retrospective series, with heterogeneous groups and different definitions regarding improvement or success making direct comparison of studies difficult. Success rates vary widely between 61% and 100%.16&#8211;22 In a recent systematic review, social continence (&#163;1 pad/d) was reported at 79% with follow-up ranging from 5 months to 192 months.23 Dry rates varied between 4% and 86%. In a prospective study of 103 patients suffering from PPI, the dry rate was 57%.21 Patients should be provided with realistic expectations, regarding their continence. They should be advised to expect an improvement in their continence, but not to be necessarily 100% dry. Many patients continue to wear a safety pad and are quite satisfied with such results.24 Litwiller et al25 found that patients with an AUS who leaked less than a teaspoon a day were satisfied and would recommend the surgery to a friend. Patients were more likely to be dissatisfied when they leaked more than a teaspoon per day. Generally, the AUS has good long-term outcomes and improves SUI sufficiently achieving a high patient satisfaction usually 80%&#8211;90%.17,25&#8211;27A significant proportion of patients suffer from SUI following radical cystectomy with neobladder (RC/NB). Studies report the incidence of SUI after RC/NB to be between 33% and 95%.28,29 Only few studies exist evaluating outcomes in patients with orthotopic neobladders who have undergone an AUS. In one of the largest series reported,30 72% (21/29) of patients noted an improvement in SUI at a mean follow-up of 40 months. However, 60% of patients underwent a revision or explantation due to infection, erosion, device malfunction, or recurrent SUI, with erosion or infection being the most common reason. Most of the AUSs placed in this series were 4.5 cm cuffs with 61&#8211;70 cm balloons. Of these patients, 28% had been treated with radiotherapy. In comparison to PPI, these outcomes seem poorer. A small proportion of RC/NB patients perform clean intermittent catheterization. This is an additional important factor to consider prior to placing an AUS as it may possibly increase the risk of erosion secondary to catheterization trauma.\nComplications\nDespite the good outcomes achieved with the AUS, it does come with a substantial need for revision surgery. A candid discussion on the potential complications of the procedure should be discussed with the patient including infection, urinary retention, urethral atrophy, erosion, or device malfunction. The complication rates are generally low; however, the need for revision surgery increases with time.\nInfection\nAs with any foreign body, infection can be a significant concern and mandates early recognition and explantation. An infection usually presents with scrotal erythema and induration at the site of the pump. It is advised to remove all components when patients present with concerns for an infected AUS, given the possibility of biofilm formation along the device.11 The rate of infection in contemporary series are reported to be between 1% and 8%,31&#8211;35 with rates <2% at high volume centers.8,36,37 Gram-positive organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis account for the majority of infections, with methicillin resistance reported in 26% of organisms.38 Gram-negative infections account for 26% of infections.38 Perioperative antibiotics are routinely administered; however, there is no standardized antibiotic regimen and the choice of antibiotics is dependent on surgeon preference. Our recommendation is to provide both gram-positive and gram-negative coverage with consideration of coverage for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus species.11\nUrinary retention\nA subset of patients suffer from urinary retention. This most often is transient and may be due to postoperative urethral inflammation, which should typically resolve over the course of several days. In a large series, Linder et al39 noted the rate of postoperative urinary retention to be 31%. Prolonged catheterization with an AUS is not recommended given that it may lead to erosion by compromising blood flow to the urethra. The smallest caliber catheter available ought to be used if needed (eg, 10 Fr or 12 Fr) and if needed for >48 hours, a suprapubic tube should be considered.11,34 If urinary retention persists for longer than a week, improper cuff sizing may be the cause, and the patient may benefit from undergoing a revision with cuff upsizing. Interestingly, urinary retention was found to be associated with adverse 6-month device survival and increased rates of erosion.39\nUrethral atrophy\nUrethral tissue atrophy, which is among the most common complications following AUS implantation, may occur naturally following persistent cuff-induced urethral compression and ischemia. Urethral atrophy and erosion lie on a spectrum and are both most often secondary to the constant compression experienced by the urethra, erosion being the more severe complication. The urethra may lose tissue bulk circumferentially with time, and a cuff that was initially sized appropriately may become too large for adequate urethral coaptation. Patients who experience urethral atrophy often complain of recurrent incontinence as a late presentation. Use of narrow-backed cuffs was meant to provide persistent adequate coaptation as urethral tissue lost bulk over time, translating into a reduced revision rate.24 Once atrophy occurs, various revision strategies, discussed in detail later, may be used to manage recurrent incontinence, including but not limited to downsizing the cuff, repositioning the cuff preferably more proximal, transcorporal cuff placement, and tandem cuff placement. Increasing the cuff pressure is not recommended as this leads to further ischemia and possibly urethral erosion.\nUrethral erosion\nErosions may occur as either an early or a late postoperative complication. When an erosion presents within the first few months, it is likely that there was an unrecognized intraoperative urethral injury at the time of AUS placement.34 Late erosions present at a median time of 19 months and at a rate of 5%&#8211;10%.40 Over time constant cuff compression may cause urethral tissue atrophy and eventually erosion. Prior studies have shown that radiation-induced endarteritis, prior urethral surgery including urethroplasty and prior anti-incontinence surgery, coronary artery disease, and compromised urethral blood flow are all risk factors for erosion.41,42 Since both urethral atrophy and erosion may present with recurrent SUI, patients who present with a recurrence of symptoms should undergo a cystoscopy before undergoing any surgical intervention to rule out erosion as these two complications are managed differently. Eroded cuffs will be exposed to urine and are traditionally associated with infection. Some erosions, however, may not show signs of overt infection within the scrotum or perineum and may remain sterile for many years. These may go unnoticed for a long time.43When a patient experiences an erosion, the device should be explanted. A recent study found that the incidence of urethral stricture formation was significantly lower when patients underwent an in situ urethroplasty, which reapproximated the epithelial edges (38%), compared to patients treated solely with an indwelling Foley catheter (85%).44 Furthermore, stricture development leads more intervening procedures prior to replacement of a new AUS, impacting a patient&#8217;s quality of life by delaying the restoration of continence. In this series, the average interval before AUS replacement was 9 months for those who underwent an in situ urethroplasty vs 17 months for those who received Foley catheter drainage only.44 A new device may then be implanted after a 3-month healing period. Nocturnal deactivation has been suggested as a prevention strategy to avoid urethral atrophy and subsequent erosion. This may be a strategy to consider in motivated patients that have the manual dexterity and understanding of how the mechanism operates.\nRadiation\nIt is worth mentioning that radiated patients may constitute a group of patients with an increased risk of complications. A significant proportion of patients with a history of locally advanced prostate cancer treatment undergo adjuvant radiotherapy. These patients should be advised that they might be at higher risk of needing revision surgery. Radiotherapy is associated with endarteritis and chronic vascular changes that may decrease urethral blood flow leading to spongiosal atrophy prior to AUS implantation.11 Several series have found higher rates of erosion or complications necessitating revisions in patients with a prior history of radiation.7,17,45,46 Despite these risks, AUS implantation leading to satisfactory continence has been successfully performed in irradiated patients. Some surgeons prefer transcorporal cuff placement in such instances and others have suggested using a lower pressured PRB (51&#8211;60 cmH2O) and delayed activation at 6 weeks.43\nMechanical failure\nIf patients develop recurrent or worsening SUI and are not found to have an erosion, it may be that the device has failed. Mechanical failures on average occur later than urethral atrophy, erosions, and infections.47 Imaging such as an ultrasound of the PRB or a CT scan may confirm a loss of fluid within the system. However, imaging will not help determine the exact location of the leak. It is advised that if there is a mechanical failure of the device after 2 years, the whole device should be replaced. Higher rates of mechanical failure were noted in a series of revisions where patients did not have complete replacements but merely had their cuffs downsized.48 Some have suggested that performing partial replacements of an AUS can lead to higher failure/leakage rates secondary to biofilm that builds on the in situ components if one uses the accessory quick connect kit rather than suture tie the connections.49\nRevisions\nAlthough the durability of AUS has been well established, a significant percentage of patients undergo revisions for various reasons, including, erosion, infection, urethral atrophy, and mechanical failure. The proportion of AUS revision surgeries performed annually is ~24%&#8211;34%.12 Generally, the reported revision rate is ~25%.47 However, it is important to consider long-term outcomes as device survival rate diminishes with longer follow-up. More specifically, reported 5-year survival rates vary between 59% and 79%,18,36,40,47,50,51 10-year survival rates between 28% and 64%,47,50&#8211;52 and 15-year survival rates between 15% and 41%.47,50 In the largest series of 1,082 AUS from a single institution with long follow-up of up to 15-years, the device survival rate at 5 years, 10 years, and 15 years was 74%, 57%, and 41%, respectively.47 These numbers are quite significant, and based on these data, patients with a significant life expectancy (greater than a decade) have a high likelihood of needing to undergo a revision in their lifetime. Although there is a high revision rate with time, most series show that AUS revisions have comparable outcomes to initial AUS placement,36,53,54 particularly if undergoing a revision for mechanical failure. Patients undergoing revisions for multiple erosions have compromised urethras and may be at higher risk of subsequent erosions.42 Revision techniques include repositioning the cuff at a different location along the urethra (preferably more proximal if possible) and downsizing the cuff, using tandem cuffs or transcorporal cuffs. In the largest multi-institutional series of revisions, the mean time to revision was 28.9 months.48 Additionally, patient satisfaction has been shown to be independent of the number of revisions, and studies have shown that up to 90% of patients undergoing revision had no change in satisfaction as long as they had a functional AUS.24&#8211;26\nTandem cuffs\nIn an effort to improve efficacy and continence, some have used tandem cuffs with the thought that increasing resistance over a greater area may improve continence. According to American Medical Systems, ~15% of AUS are placed as tandem cuffs.55 Brito et al56 was the first to describe successful tandem cuff placement with success reported at 95%. The idea behind tandem cuffs was that using two cuffs would lead to increased resistance to leakage57 without increasing pressure on a single segment of the urethra. Despite initial enthusiasm and favorable continence outcomes from several groups following tandem cuffs for patients with severe PPI, urethral atrophy or prior failed single cuff placement,56&#8211;60 subsequent longer follow-up demonstrated a higher risk of complications when using tandem cuffs.18 Additionally, the authors of a cadaver study did not find a significant difference in retrograde leak point pressure for single vs tandem cuffs. They did find an association between urethral circumference and retrograde leak point pressure, which favors proximal cuff placement.61 In reviewing this literature, one must keep in mind that most of these series56,57,59,60,62 are retrospective in nature and not randomized. Therefore, a selection bias in choosing patients who underwent tandem cuff placement likely exists. It is likely that two cuffs do provide greater continence, but the benefit may be not worth the cost of increased complications.\nTranscorporal\nTranscorporal cuff placement was developed in an attempt to improve continence in patients with recurrent incontinence secondary to erosion, subcuff urethral atrophy, inadequate urethral coaptation, or for patients undergoing revisions where more proximal placement could not be achieved.63 Initial success for transcorporal placement was reported at 84%. The advantages of transcorporal placement include avoiding a difficult distal dorsal urethral dissection near the corpora, which may result in a thin urethra, as well as the additional bulk provided by the tunica. In a prospective series of transcorporal AUS placement, dry or socially continent rates were reported to be 76% at median follow-up of 20 months.64There is a concern that transcorporal cuff placement affects erectile dysfunction. However, most patients undergoing transcorporal cuff placement have undergone prostate cancer treatment and already have some degree of erectile dysfunction at baseline.20,64&#8211;67 Despite this concern, a small series did report that the majority of patients maintain their erectile function even after transcorporal cuff placement if they had it to begin with, although the numbers are small, 5/6 (83%).64\nAUS following sling placement\nThe outcomes of primary AUS placement are comparable to those performed after prior sling placement. Following sling surgery, recurrence of incontinence ranges from 20% to 35%.68 An AUS may be placed following a bone-anchored sling, transobturator sling, or quadratic sling. Transobturator slings may be left in place when placing the AUS. Usually, the transobturator sling cannot be seen during the AUS placement, and the AUS may simply be placed around the bulbar urethra via a perineal incision. In order to place an AUS after a bone-anchored sling, the sling must be incised and dissected off the bulbospongiosus muscle to expose the bulbar urethra or the AUS may be placed more distally via a transscrotal approach.69 Finally, the quadratic sling can easily be identified through the perineum and can be incised and dissected from the bulbospongiosus muscle unveiling the unscarred urethra deep to it and allowing placement of the AUS.68 AUS outcomes following sling placement are high, with success rates reported to be 79%&#8211;83%.70,71 Complication rates appear to be similar to initial AUS placement.\nNew inventions\nDespite an increase in surgical options for PPI, including slings, bulking agents, and stem cell therapy, the AUS remains the gold standard. Given the difficulties with implanting the device, as well as the significant rate for revisions, there has been a push for the development of new devices. In recent years, there have been new inventions; however, none have yet been approved for use in the US. Most of these new devices attempt to simplify implantation by decreasing the number of connecting parts. Additionally, many of these devices are developed to allow in situ adjustment of the pressure cuff since constant urethral pressure is the likely cause of urethral atrophy and subsequent erosion.\nFlowSecure\nAn adjustable AUS named the FlowSecure (Sphinx Medical, Bellshill, Scotland) has been undergoing trials predominately in the UK. Developed in 2006, it functions similarly to the AUS in that it has a PRB, pump, and cuff; however, the FlowSecure has an additional &#8220;stress-relieving balloon&#8221; and comes as a one-piece device.72,73 The idea of the FlowSecure is to decrease the magnitude of constant urethral pressure in the hope that this will decrease the erosion rates. It has two separate balloons, one that keeps the cuff inflated at low pressures and another which increases pressure to the cuff in response to an increase in intra-abdominal pressure.74 The &#8220;stress relieving balloon&#8221; allows the cuff to rest at a lower baseline pressure exerted by the PRB by providing intermittent increases in pressure to the urethra that is administered when there is an increase in intra-abdominal pressure. Additionally, the pressure of the FlowSecure can be adjusted by injecting or removing saline transscrotally through the pump, allowing individualization of the pressure according to the individual patient&#8217;s SUI severity. Although initial results in nine patients appeared promising,72 in another study of 100 patients who underwent placement of the FlowSecure, 28% underwent explantation of the device for early and late infections, perforation of the pump at pressurization and mechanical failure.75 An additional disadvantage is that patients require multiple pressurization procedures, typically three before reaching an adequate pressure.73\nPeriurethral constrictor\nThe periurethral constrictor (PUC; Silimed, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) was initially designed in 1996 for pediatric patients. However, its use has been reported in adults with PPI. The PUC is an adjustable hydraulic system that includes the constrictor connected to a valve that is placed subcutaneously in the lower abdomen where it can be accessed and punctured with a needle. Patients do not need to mechanically pump the PUC and typically must void abdominally. Although initial reports were not as robust,76 the most recent report of 62 patients with at least 18-month follow-up indicates a continence rate of 79%.77\nZephyr\nThe Zephyr or ZSI 375 is an AUS produced by Zephyr Surgical Implants (Geneva, Switzerland), a Swiss&#8211;French company. It is a hydraulic-based system that is implanted as a single unit via two separate incisions. The cuff is placed via a perineal incision, and the pump is placed in a subdartos pouch within the scrotum. The pump is adjustable in situ so that urethral pressure may be adjusted as needed to improve continence. In a series of 34 patients with SUI, &#8220;social continence&#8221; was achieved in 94.2%. Two devices (5.8%) were explanted because of infection. Longer follow-up is needed to determine the durability of the device and the rates of explantation due to urethral atrophy or erosion.78\nTape mechanical occlusive device\nA new artificial sphincter, the Tape Mechanical Occlusive Device (TMOD; GT Urological, Minneapolis, MN, USA) is currently under development.79 Rather than rely on a hydraulic mechanism such as the AMS 800, TMOD uses a spring-loaded mechanism to apply circumferential pressure around the urethra. This device is also a one-piece device that should facilitate implantation. The control is an ON and OFF switch, which patients should find easier to control than the pump of the current AMS 800. At this time, the TMOD has only been studied in a canine model and human cadavers. These studies have demonstrated that the device provides occlusive pressure when activated in the 50&#8211;80 cmH2O range. Thus, far it has proven to be technically feasible and biocompatible. Live human clinical trials are to follow.Various new devices are under development. None are currently approved for use in the US. Most of the devices at this time require further investigation, need to be implanted in a greater number of patients, and need longer follow-up to determine their durability and long-term rates of complications. An advantage of most of the new devices is that they are purportedly less expensive than the AMS 800.\nConclusion\nDespite the wide variation in results and heterogeneity of studies, one can surmise that the AUS has been a highly effective surgical solution for many patients suffering from moderate to severe SUI and has significantly improved the quality of life for many patients. However, given the current mechanism inherent to the function of the AUS which is via urethral compression, concerns for urethral atrophy and erosion arise from potentially decreased perfusion of the affected urethral segment. Additionally, with time, mechanical failure of the device may occur. Therefore, a significant percentage of patients will require a revision, which increases with longer follow-up. Various techniques and strategies have been developed over the years to successfully handle these clinical scenarios. While we continue to await the outcomes of newer devices under development, the AMS 800 model currently remains the gold standard.", "pmid": "27445509", "title": "Artificial urinary sphincters for male stress urinary incontinence: current perspectives", "journal_title": "Medical Devices (Auckland, N.Z.)", "authors": "Billy H Cordon;Nirmish Singla;Ajay K Singla", "doi": "10.2147/MDER.S93637", "score": "0.011252191"}, {"keywords": "", "abstract": "Background\nBinding of serum components by surface M-related proteins, encoded by the emm genes, in streptococci constitutes a major virulence factor in this important group of organisms. The present study demonstrates fibrinogen binding by S. iniae, a Lancefield non-typeable pathogen causing devastating fish losses in the aquaculture industry and an opportunistic pathogen of humans, and identifies the proteins involved and their encoding genes.Results\nFibrinogen binding by S. iniae significantly reduced respiratory burst activity of barramundi peritoneal macrophages in primary cultures compared to BSA-treated or untreated controls, indicating a potentially important role for fibrinogen binding cell-surface proteins in avoiding phagocytic attack in fish. We describe a novel emm-like gene, simA, encoding a 57 kDa fibrinogen binding M-like protein in S. iniae. These SiM proteins and their corresponding tetrameric structures from some sequevar types (~230 kDa) bound fibrinogen in Western blots. simA was most closely related (32% identity) to the demA gene of S. dysgalactiae. Genome walking and sequencing determined the genetic organization of the simA region had similarities to the mgrC regulon in GCS and to S. uberis. Moreover, a putative multigene regulator, mgx was orientated in the opposite direction to the simA gene in common with S. uberis, but contrary to findings in GAS and GCS. In GAS, diversity among emm-genes and consequent diversity of their M-related proteins results in substantial antigenic variation. However, an extensive survey of S. iniae isolates from diverse geographic regions and hosts revealed only three variants of the gene, with one sequevar accounting for all but two of the 50 isolates analysed.Conclusion\nThese proteins play a role in avoiding oxidative attack by phagocytic cells during infection of fish by S. iniae, but genetic diversity amongst these key surface proteins has not yet arisen. This lack of diversity coupled with a functional role in macrophage resistance suggests that these proteins may constitute important targets for future vaccines against S. iniae in fish.", "body": "Background\nOne of the most devastating diseases to warm water finfish aquaculture is caused by Streptococcus iniae. First isolated from a captive Amazon River dolphin, Inia geoffrensis, in 1976, S. iniae has caused outbreaks of disease in Israel, Australia, Japan, and the United States [1]. The economic losses attributed to S. iniae are estimated to be up to $US10 million annually in the US and over $US100 million globally [2]. Infection in farmed fish usually presents as small red lesions on the skin followed by exophthalmia, and it is found systemically in the blood, kidneys and brain [1]. It is also a known zoonotic pathogen causing a handful of infections to date mainly in elderly people. S. iniae is a beta-haemolytic species that does not belong to any Lancefield group[3,4].It is well established that other streptococcal species such as S. pyogenes (GAS), S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus (GCS), and S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis (GCS/GGS) possess M or M-like proteins [5-8]. These proteins are located on the surface of the bacterial cell and are considered in GAS to be the dominant virulence factor allowing evasion of phagocytosis and host cell attachment [9]. M proteins are coiled-coil proteins [9,10] characterised by having a signal sequence followed by a hypervariable region, a central region containing a number of repeats, and a cell wall anchor motif [10].The genes upstream and downstream of the emm gene vary from group to group and within species. In GAS, the multigene regulator gene, mga, is upstream of the emm gene and a C5a peptidase gene is downstream. However, some strains of GAS can also have an emm-related protein gene and an enn gene [6]. Variations in the emm gene region of the genome in GCS and GGS have also been noted where the multigene regulator, mgc, is upstream of the emm gene, but no other emm-like genes are found [6]. Instead, the cpdB gene is either present or absent between the emm gene and the rel gene.One of the functions of the M protein is the binding of fibrinogen [9,11-13]. In strains of S. dysgalactiae, the M protein has also been reported to bind other blood components such as serum albumin, IgG, IgA, and plasminogen [13]. Ability to bind fibrinogen is recognised as a major factor in resistance to phagocytosis [9,11,14]In this paper, we describe for the first time the emm-like genes, simA and simB, from a Lancefield-untypeable Streptococcus species &#8211; Streptococcus iniae. In other streptococci, M-like proteins are highly diverse contributing to substantial antigenic diversity, however in a survey of 50 isolates from disparate hosts and geographical origin, only 3 variants of the sim gene were identified in S. iniae. The genetic organization in the vicinity of the sim genes is similar to other streptococci, including a multigene regulator upstream with a putative toxic anion resistance gene downstream. The SiM proteins encoded by the simA and simB genes bind fibrinogen and we demonstrate that fibrinogen binding by S. iniae reduces respiratory burst activity in barramundi peritoneal macrophages indicating a likely role in phagocytic evasion and virulence in teleost fish.\nResults\n\nFibrinogen binding by \nWild-type Streptococcus iniae QMA0076 and QMA0072 were capable of binding biotin-labelled human fibrinogen in vitro as evidenced by fluorescence microscopy of cells counter-labelled with avidin conjugated FITC (Figure 1). This was corroborated for strain QMA0076 by an independent dot-blot assay in which whole cells incubated with biotin-labelled fibrinogen and extensively washed were spotted onto PVDF membrane that was subsequently probed with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated avidin (Figure 2a). QMA0141 did not bind significant quantities of labelled fibrinogen by either method (Figures 1 and 2a). Interestingly, fibrinogen binding was only observed when cells were cultured on blood agar or grown in barramundi (Lates calcarifer, Bloch) serum, and not when grown in vegetable peptone broth (Figure 2a). Pre-incubating with fresh barramundi plasma prior to incubation with biotinylated fibrinogen reduced fibrinogen binding ability, but only marginally (Figure 2b)\nEffect of Fibrinogen binding on activation of barramundi peritoneal leucocytes\nTo investigate the role of fibrinogen binding by S. iniae, the effect of pre-incubating S. iniae QMA0072 with fibrinogen on subsequent phagocytosis and respiratory burst in barramundi peritoneal leucocytes was investigated. Fibrinogen binding by QMA0072 significantly decreased subsequent phagocytosis-induced respiratory burst in barramundi peritoneal leucocytes when compared to controls pre-incubated with the same concentration of BSA or in PBS alone (Figure. 3).\nNone\nIn order to find genes for putative fibrinogen binding proteins in S. iniae a homology cloning strategy was employed using a number of previously published and novel primers designed based on streptococcal emm and emm-like genes (Table 1). The previously published ALL M primer pair (Table 1) enabled sequencing of the full length sim (Streptococcus iniae emm-like) gene. Primers for genome walking were designed to determine the true sequence of the gene for the extreme 5' and 3' end nucleotides since the ALL M primer pair introduced artefactual nucleotides (spacer region and encoding amino acids MA at the 5' end and KRKEEN at the 3' end) to the initially deduced sequence. The full length of the simA gene was determined to be 1566 bp encoding a 521 amino acid protein in most strains (Figure 4), however, the protein for isolate QMA0072 had one amino acid insertion, and the sim gene for isolate QMA0141 (encoded by simB) was 579 amino acids (Table 3). The respective molecular masses of the proteins (with signal peptides) for isolates QMA0072, QMA0076, and QMA0141 were 57,589, 57,467, and 63,667 Da respectively. The mature proteins have molecular masses of 53,416, 53,303, and 59,446 Da respectively. There were changes to the amino acid sequence at the 3' end of the nucleotide sequence encoding for KRKEEE. Sequencing of the simA gene of S. iniae followed by translation from strain QMA0076 revealed that it was distinct from the other known M and M-like protein types from S. pyogenes, S. suis, S. equi subsp. equi, S. dysgalactiae, and S. uberis. Sequence alignment of the different types of sim gene products from S. iniae with their closest matching counterpart, the demA gene product from S. dysgalactiae, are presented in Figure 4.\nOrganisation of genes in the vicinity of the \nGenome walking allowed the determination of the genes immediately surrounding the simA gene and their relative translational directions. A probable ribosomal binding site with sequence AGGAG was found 11 bases upstream of the start of transcription of the simA gene (Figure 5). A putative regulatory protein binding site 45 nucleotides in length was found with a recognition site very similar to that found in the promoter regions of the emm and scpA genes in GAS [15] (Figure 5). Inverted repeats that occur between the ends of the simA gene and telX are likely to be a putative rho-independent transcriptional terminator (Figure 5).At the 5' end of the simA gene (261 nt upstream) is an ORF of 1488 nt encoding a 495 amino acid protein that shares 39% identity to sequences of Mgc from S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis (GCS) and 34% identity to Mga for S. pyogenes (GAS) (Figure 6). Due to the level of homology, this gene has been designated mgx (multigene regulator of Lancefield group unknown streptococci) and the encoded protein is therefore Mgx. The mgx gene is orientated in the opposite direction to the simA gene. This region of the genome is therefore also named mgrX (multigene regulon-like genomic segment in Lancefield group unknown streptococci).At the 3' end of the simA gene, (110 nt downstream) is a gene, orientated in the opposite direction, with high identity (81%; similarity of 93% at the amino acid level) to the tellurite resistance/toxic anion resistance gene telA from S. pyogenes MGAS8232 (Figure 7). This gene of 1251 nt encodes a protein of 416 amino acids and has been designated as telX. Another 20 nucleotides upstream from telX is an ORF of 885 nt encoding a 294 amino acid protein which is most closely related to hypothetical gene Spy_0159 from S. pyogenes M1 GAS with 40% identity and 63% similarity (Figure 7). This gene in S. iniae has been called sihA (S. iniae hypothetical gene A).A further 110 nucleotides upstream from the start of sihA is a probable start for a purA-like gene encoding adenylosuccinate synthase (EC 6.3.4.4), although an alternative start codon 305 nt upstream would encode a protein with greater similarity to that from S. pyogenes rather than S. suis.It was found that the genes mgx, simA, and telX were similar to genes found in other streptococcal species. However, unlike in GAS, GCS and GGS, and as only found thus far in S. uberis [16], the mgx gene is orientated in the opposite direction relative to the simA gene (Figure 8).\nDiversity of \nIn the Group A Streptococci (GAS), diversity of the M proteins accounts for significant antigenic variations and constitutes a major obstacle to vaccine development. By using the PRE SIM and POST SIM primer pair, an expected PCR product of 2048 bp was produced when tested on an additional 49 isolates (Table 2) with only two exceptions. Isolate QMA0072, which had an insertion in the simA gene, produced a PCR product of 2051 bp and QMA0141 produced a larger product of 2180 bp. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences for isolates QMA0076 and QMA0072 were identical except for the insertion of three nucleotides (1 aa residue) (Figure 4). The gene sequence for isolate QMA0141 was most divergent having 100% amino acid residue identity for the first 35 residues and 100% similarity for the first 41 residues. This also confirms the theoretical position of where the signal sequence is cleaved to produce the mature SiM protein (Figure 4). This gene was approximately 10% larger than the simA gene and was designated simB. The nucleotide sequence identity of the simA gene in all isolates tested was 100%. The length of the intergenic spacer regions upstream and downstream of the simA gene in all isolates was the same size, except for isolate QMA0141 (simB), which had a larger sequence downstream. Variations in the upstream intergenic spacer sequence were limited. Thus, the same genetic organization was present in all of the isolates tested.\nNone\nThe mgx gene encodes the protein Mgx which contains helix-turn-helix structures (Figure 6). Sequence alignment with other multigene regulators from S. pyogenes and S. dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae showed that there was a high level of conservation in the HTH-4 helix-turn-helix domain from residues 106&#8211;125 with these Mgx homologues. This is a common feature of all multigene regulator proteins found in GAS and GCS/GGS and from some unfinished genome projects and is necessary for transcriptional activation of virulence factors [17]. The multigene regulator in S. iniae was more divergent as a whole, than those of other streptococcal groups, especially in the other known helix-turn-helix region (HTH-3) (Figure 6). Putative Mgx protein binding motifs were found in the spacer regions upstream of the simA or simB genes in all isolates sequenced (Figure 9). Variations in Mgx binding sites between isolates may be due to differences in the Mgx protein in different isolates. Like the binding sites in other species, it is 45 bp long and overlaps the -35 promoter box [15]. The region on the right hand side of the consensus sequence (CR) is more conserved than that from the left (CL) [15] (Figure 9).\nSiM protein sequence analysis\nThe N-terminal of the major SiM protein type from isolate QMA0076 has a probable signal sequence cleavage site between amino acids 41 and 42 resulting in a mature protein of 480 amino acids with a molecular mass of ~53 kDa (Figure 4). For isolate QMA0141, the signal peptide cleavage point is also between residues 41 and 42 resulting in a mature protein of 538 residues with a molecular mass of ~59 kDa (Figure 4). In the C terminal end of all of the SiM proteins is the conserved Gram positive cell wall anchor motif LPSTG [18]. The N-terminal region of the SiM protein types had very similar signal peptides, but the first residues of the mature protein differed significantly while there was a high level of conservation at the C terminal ends of the proteins. This indicates that selective pressures have been exerted upon the exposed N terminal parts of the protein.Analysis by the Garnier algorithm [19] for isolate QMA0076 predicted that 77.2% of the protein was alpha-helical. For isolates QMA0072 and QMA0141, the predicted values were 77.1% and 77.4% respectively for their SiM proteins.Analysis by the COIL program [20,21] with a window length of 28 predicted that the protein from isolate QMA0076 (with signal sequence) has two coiled-coil segments from residues 79&#8211;174 and 181&#8211;454 with a probability of 1.00 for each segment. This is a similar result to that of Vasi et al. (2000)[18] who identified M-like proteins from S. dysgalactiae. By weighting the first and fourth residues in the heptad repeats a probability of 1.00 was gained for residues 91 to 449. Similarly, for isolate QMA0072 two coiled-coil segments from residues 79&#8211;174 and 196&#8211;455 with a probability of 1.00 for each segment were predicted. Weighting the first and fourth residues in the heptad repeats gave a prediction with a probability of 1.00 for two segments from residues 91&#8211;186 and 213&#8211;450.The SiM protein from isolate QMA0141 showed a probability of 1.00 that there was a coiled-coil structure from residues 154&#8211;512 with a weighted heptad, and coiled-coils at residues 151&#8211;231 and 238&#8211;512 when an unweighted heptad was used.The SiM proteins also share repeat elements that are a feature of M proteins. QMA0072 and QMA0076 contained five repeat elements of the residue sequence AELE. In contrast, the SiM protein from isolate QMA0141 contained five pairs of repeat elements represented by KEEE, AELE, AKVAELEKAL, ELEA, and KAELEK. Large peptide sequence motifs conserved across all SiM proteins are HEAIRSAGLE between the coils, the signal peptide, and the C terminal end which has few variations over the last ~255 residues of the protein.\nPAGE and Western blot analysis of expressed SiM proteins\nAnalysis by SDS-PAGE of non-reduced expressed proteins (Fig. 10A) showed that there were bands present which were different to that contained in the control E. coli lysate. Prominent protein bands were present at ~230 kDa from isolates QMA072 and QMA076; but not for isolate QMA0141.Western blotting was used to detect the fibrinogen binding proteins from these lysates. Binding of biotinylated fibrinogen followed by detection with alkaline phosphatase conjugated streptavidin in Western blots of SDS-PAGE separated lysates from E. coli expressing recombinant SiM proteins showed that the SiM proteins from isolates QMA0072 and QMA0076 appeared as monomeric of ~57 kDa as expected and also as tetramers of ~230 kDa. A band that weakly bound fibrinogen was also observed that appears to be a dimer at ~115 kDa. The SiM protein from isolate QMA0141 appeared as bands at ~64 kDa and ~255 kDa and does not appear to bind fibrinogen as strongly as that from isolates QMA0072 and QMA0076 (Fig. 10B). The formation of tetramers has been observed in SiM proteins from other species [12].\nDiscussion\nEvasion of phagocytosis is critical in the pathogenic strategies of many of the streptococci [9]. In S. iniae, capsule has been identified as a major virulence factor [22,23] contributing to resistance to serum killing [24] and phagocytic evasion [25]. In other streptococci, binding of serum components by surface associated M-like proteins constitutes a major antiphagocytic mechanism. In the present study, we have demonstrated fibrinogen binding by whole S. iniae cells in vitro. Biotinylated fibrinogen that bound to the cell surface could be detected by fluorescence microscopy using fluorescein conjugated streptavidin. Because the fluorophore faded quickly under fluorescence microscopy an alternative dot-blot method was developed using an alkaline phosphatase conjugate. This enabled semi-quantitative evaluation of fibrinogen binding and indicated that strain QMA0141 bound less fibrinogen than QMA0076. This was supported by Western blots using the recombinantly expressed proteins from these strains and is reflected in the differing sim gene sequences of these isolates. As an indication of the potential role of fibrinogen binding by S. iniae, S. iniae cells incubated with fibrinogen prior to exposure to barramundi macrophages significantly reduced the subsequent respiratory burst of the macrophages, indicative of reduced phagocytosis.Interestingly, fibrinogen binding was not detected when strains were grown overnight in vegetable peptone broth, and was only observed following growth on blood agar or in heat inactivated barramundi serum. This suggests that these proteins may be the same proteins previously reported to bind trout immunoglobulins, or are under the same regulatory control [26]. In the present study, we found a putative multigene regulator, encoded by mgx, upstream of the simA or simB gene. The sim genes from S. iniae are, in common with emm and emm-like genes, most likely to be controlled by this multigene regulator; a 45 bp putative DNA binding site for the Mgx protein lies between bases 184 and 140 upstream of the sim genes [27,28] and overlaps the -35 RNA polymerase promoter box as has been determined for GAS [15]. Further studies are ongoing to determine if, as in GAS with Mga, the Mgx protein binds to this promoter region and activates transcription of sim and also to identify if Mgx is involved in its own regulation [29]. Additionally, the environmental conditions that govern regulation of these genes are being explored in order to optimise expression in culture.The SiM proteins are quite different from previously reported M proteins in other streptococci, with the closest relative being the S. dysgalactiae dem gene at only 32% identity. In terms of the genetic organization of the MgrX segment, some similarities were found not only with GAS and GCS but also with the unusual S. uberis. In S. iniae the mgx gene was organised in reverse orientation to the sim genes. This reversal has only been found to date in GES/GBS S. uberis where the genetic organization of the multigene regulator and the lactoferrin binding protein are in opposite directions [16]. This differs from GAS, GCS and GGS where the orientation of the multigene regulatory and emm, emm-like and dem genes is in the same direction.Similarities with GAS were found from the many genome sequencing projects from GAS serotypes M1, M3, M5, M6, M18 and M28 [27,28,30-34]. In all of these genomes, the genes for telA, Spy_0159 (and other names given to this hypothetical gene), and purA are located side by side and in the same relative transcriptional directions as telX, sihA, and purA in S. iniae. The genes upstream of telA in GAS may be involved with energy production and conversion, however, downstream of the purA gene is a putative lipoprotein ABC transporter gene and a streptolysin O precursor gene, which may indicate a role in virulence for these genes. The roles of these homologous genes in S. iniae may also be similar, especially when their proximity to mgx is considered, and the potential for other virulence factors that may be located nearby.As evidenced by Western blotting of recombinant SiM proteins expressed in E. coli, the SiM protein from isolate QMA0076 appeared to bind the most fibrinogen, with that from isolate QMA0141 binding very little fibrinogen following transfer to the PVDF membrane. The one amino acid residue insertion after the intercoil region (in the second coiled region) of isolate QMA0072 did not appear to significantly disrupt the fibrinogen binding ability of the coils. It is interesting to note that all SiM protein sequences, regardless of size or divergence, contain the peptide sequence HEAIRSAGLE that connects the two coils. Conservation of this peptide indicates that it is likely to have a critical structural role for the binding of blood components such as fibrinogen and immunoglobulins [13] and needs to be investigated further. The signal peptide and C terminal ends were well conserved in all SiM types indicating that very little selective pressure has been exerted on these regions.The ability to form tetrameric conglomerations may also be due to the coiled regions interacting with one another since the apparent molecular mass of ~230 kDa has also been observed with a fibrinogen binding protein from S. equi subsp. equi [12]. It is interesting to note that the ability of the SiM protein from isolate QMA0141, which had a much larger molecular weight, did not bind fibrinogen as efficiently as the major type. Given that other M and M-like proteins are able to bind other blood proteins, the ability of these proteins to bind them also cannot be discounted. Indeed, a previous study reported binding of immunoglobulin from normal trout serum by S. iniae proteins of a similar molecular weight to the tetramers described in this study [26].The lack of diversity of the sim genes present in our strain collection, which represents isolates from disparate geographic location and hosts, is surprising, especially when viewed in the context of emm gene sequence diversity found in GAS [35]. Only three gene types were found, with two of these types occurring only once each (Table 3). This may simply be a result of functional conservation, with sequence variation resulting in reduced binding capacity, as indicated in the present study with isolate QMA0141, leading to strains with this gene type to be relatively unsuccessful. An alternative hypothesis may be that there has been little or no selective pressure applied by the infected fish host to drive a change in this protein: perhaps as result of the organization of the fish immunogloblin light chains [36], they appear to be able to recognise a less diverse repertoire of epitopes than their mammalian counterparts [37] and SiM proteins simply may not be immunogenic in fish. This is corroborated by previous work in trout and by observations in our own laboratory that antiserum from whole-cell immunised barramundi do not detect SiM proteins in Western blots (unpublished data). An alternative explanation is that once fish are infected with S. iniae, the opportunity to produce antibodies is negated by the short period of time between infection and death. The introduction of vaccination programmes against S. iniae into warm water aquaculture may provide the selective pressure required to drive evolution of further diversity in these genes.In the present study, genes encoding a fibrinogen-binding M-like protein have been cloned, sequenced and expressed as recombinants for the first time from this pathogen of major importance in global aquaculture. It has been shown that members of the M protein family contribute to virulence of Streptococcus sp., have the ability to bind blood components other than fibrinogen, and have a role in resistance to phagocytosis [9,11,12,38-41]. The present results support this observation, indicating that binding of fibrinogen by S. iniae reduced respiratory burst activity in fish macrophages. Moreover, an earlier study indicated proteins with a similar apparent molecular weight to those reported in this study are capable of binding trout immunoglobulins in reverse orientation (i.e. by the Fc region) [26]. Fibrinogen binding by S. iniae was only apparent in cultures grown on blood agar or in barramundi serum, indicating that SiM expression is likely to be environmentally regulated. Our identification of a putative regulatory protein and binding site upstream of the sim genes will enable further research into the control of these genes. The M protein is a major virulence factor and vaccine candidate in GAS [42-45] and future work is directed towards investigating the potential of a vaccine against S. iniae infection in farmed fish based on these intriguing proteins.\nExperimental Procedures\n\nNone\nVeterinary laboratory isolates of S. iniae taken from infected barramundi (Lates calcarifer), along with reference isolates from the Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, and further global isolates were used in this study (Table 2). Strains in 20% glycerol that were stored at -80&#176;C were grown overnight at 37&#176;C on Columbia agar base containing 5% defibrinated sheep blood. For liquid cultures, S. iniae was grown in 10 ml vegetable peptone broth (Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK) in sterile 15 ml centrifuge tubes (Greiner Bio-One, Germany) statically at 37&#176;C.\nWhole cell fibrinogen binding assay\nHuman fibrinogen (Sigma, Castle Hill, Australia) was labelled using the EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS Biotinylation Kit (Pierce, Rockford, Il.) in accordance with the manufacturers instructions. Unincorporated biotin was removed using Micro-Spin G-25 columns (GE Healthcare Biosciences, North Ryde, Australia). Barramundi blood was collected by caudal venipuncture from 150 g fish using a 1 ml tuberculin syringe fitted with a 23 G needle. For serum, blood was allowed to clot for 24 hours at 4&#176;C to ensure complete removal of fibrinogen before centrifugation at 3000 &#215; g for 10 min to remove blood cells. For collection of plasma, 50 &#956;L ice-cold heparin (10 U/mL) was drawn into the syringe prior to blood collection. Blood cells were removed by centrifugation at 3000 &#215; g and plasma was either used immediately or stored at -20&#176;C until required.S. iniae cultured overnight on blood agar, in 1 ml heat inactivated barramundi serum or in vegetable peptone broth at 28&#176;C was washed and suspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to an optical density of 2.5 at 600 nm. Aliquots (200 &#956;L) were then incubated in Tris buffered saline (TBS) containing 5 &#956;g/mL biotinylated fibrinogen, or in TBS alone as a control for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were harvested at 6,000 &#215; g for 5 min in a microcentrifuge and then washed six times in 1 mL TBS to remove any unbound fibrinogen. For fluorescence detection of bound fibrinogen, washed test and control cells were incubated with streptavidin-conjugated fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) diluted to 25 &#956;g/mL in PBS for 30 min. Cells were then washed eight times in PBS before resuspension in 50 &#956;L PBS. Aliquots (10 &#956;L) were then transferred onto washed glass microscope slides and covered with a glass cover slip. These wet mounts were then viewed under phase contrast using and Olympus BX41 epifluorescence microscope. As FITC fades rapidly upon UV exposure a procedure to eliminate exposure prior to capture was optimised as follows. Once a suitable field had been located under phase contrast it was photographed using the attached Olympus DP70 digital video camera. With the shutter between the stage and mercury vapour lamp closed to prevent UV exposure of the labelled cells, the FITC filter was moved into position and the camera setting adjusted manually to ISO800 and a shutter speed of 1.3s. The stage shutter was then opened to expose the cells to UV light and the image was captured simultaneously.To support results obtained by fluorescence microscopy, a whole cell dot-blot method was used. In this method cells labelled with biotinylated fibrinogen and controls in TBS as described above were serially twofold diluted in TBS in a microtitre plate. A row containing serially diluted (from 2.5 &#956;g/mL) biotinylated fibrinogen was included as a positive control. Aliquots (5 &#956;L) were then transferred to pre-wetted PVDF (Immobilon P, Millipore, UK) using a multichannel pipette and allowed to dry. The membrane was then blocked for 1 hour with 1% vitamin-free casein (Sigma, Castle Hill, Australia) in TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST). Following blocking, endogenous phosphatase activity was quenched with 20% acetic acid in distilled water for 5 min. After 3 &#215; 5 min washes in TBST, the membrane was probed with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin (0.2 units/mL) in TBST for 30 min. The membrane was then washed (&#215;3) in TBST and then once in TBS before developing in a liquid phosphatase substrate (1-Step NBT/BCIP, Pierce, Rockford Il.) until the colour developed.\nIsolation and culture of peritoneal macrophages from barramundi\nMacrophages from casein stimulated peritoneal cavity were harvested, purified and maintained as described previously [46]. Briefly, for stimulation of the peritoneum, barramundi (Lates calcarifer) (300 g) were anaesthetisised with Aqui-S (Aquatic Diagnostic Services, Wilston, Australia) in accordance with the manufacturers instructions, and then injected with 1 mL of 12% casein (sterile, in phosphate buffered saline, PBS) into their peritoneal cavity 24 h before collection of macrophages. Prior to the isolation of peritoneal macrophages, fish were euthanised with overdose Aqui-S and then exsanguinated by cutting the ventral aorta. An aliquot (5 mL) L-15 medium containing 2% Foetal Bovine Serum (FBS, Invitrogen, Melbourne, Australia), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (P/S) (Invitrogen, Melbourne, Australia), and 10 U/mL heparin (Sigma, Castle Hill, Australia) was injected aseptically into the peritoneal cavity using a syringe fitted with a 25 G needle. The body cavity was then massaged for 30 s to disperse the medium and the lavage containing leucocytes was withdrawn using 19 G syringe very carefully to prevent bleeding. The suspensions of peritoneal cells were then layered onto a discontinuous (34%/51%) Percoll density gradient and centrifuged at 450 g for 25 min at 4&#176;C. The band lying at the interface was collected and washed twice with L-15 medium containing1% FBS and 1% P/S. Concentration of viable cells was determined by Trypan blue exclusion. The cells were seeded in microtiter plates at the concentration of 107 cells/mL in L-15 medium with1% FBS and 1% P/S. Cell populations were allowed to adhere for 2 h at 28&#176;C and then washed twice with L-15 medium to remove the unattached cells. The adhered cells were maintained in L-15 with 1% FBS and 1% P/S at 28&#176;C. For the assay, 24 h cultures were used.\nInduction of luminol-amplified chemiluminescence in peritoneal macrophages\nStreptococcus iniae strain QMA0072 was used for this assay. A suspension of cells taken directly from blood agar cultures (OD600 = 1.5) was washed in PBS then pre-incubated in PBS, 5 &#956;g/mL bovine serum albumen (BSA) in PBS, or 5 &#956;g/mL fibrinogen in PBS for 30 minutes at 37&#176;C. The cells were then washed twice with HBSS and resuspended in HBSS.The respiratory burst activity of the peritoneal macrophages following phagocytosis was determined using protocols described previously [47] with some modifications. Briefly, peritoneal macrophages, cultured for 24 h, were incubated with either fibrinogen-treated, PBS-treated or BSA-treated S. iniae at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 100 (bacteria/macrophage ratio 100:1). The respiratory burst activity was initiated by the addition of 30 &#956;L of the required bacterial suspension to macrophages in microtitre plates (1 &#215; 105 cells per well). To each well, 10 &#956;L of 10 mM luminol in 0.2 M borate buffer pH 9.0 and 280 &#956;L HBSS pH 7.4 were also added to get a final volume of 300 &#956;L. The chemiluminescence (CL) emissions of the phagocytes were measured in a luminometer/fluorometer (BMG Fluostar Optima, BMG Labtech, Offenberg, Germany) every 3 minutes for 3 hours at 27&#176;C.\nRecombinant DNA techniques\nS. iniae genomic DNA was extracted from freshly-grown cells using an enzymatic lysis method [7].\nPCR Amplification of \nEach 50 &#956;L PCR tube contained 5 &#956;L of 10 &#215; Tth plus buffer, 1 &#956;L dNTP's (4 &#215; 2.5 mM of each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP and dTTP; Biotech International Ltd., Australia), 200 ng of ALL MF and ALL MR primers (Table 1), 0.5 U of Tth plus DNA polymerase (Biotech International Ltd., Australia), 3 &#956;L of 25 mM magnesium chloride, and the balance made up with sterile Milli-Q water. Thermal cycling parameters in an Eppendorf Mastercycler Gradient EPS (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) were denaturation for 2 mins at 94&#176;C followed by 35 cycles of 50&#176;C for 1 min, 72&#176;C for 2 min, and 94&#176;C for 15 s with a final extension cycle of 50&#176;C for 1 min and 72&#176;C for 10 min. The resultant PCR products were visualised after electrophoresis in a 1% w/v agarose gel containing 0.5 &#956;L of 10 mg/mL ethidium bromide solution in 1&#215; TAE as the electrophoresis buffer.Desired bands were excised from the gel and extracted from the agarose with the MegaSpin Agarose Gel Extraction Kit (Intron Biotechnology, Korea). Purified PCR products were ligated into PCR4-TOPO by TA cloning using a commercial kit (Invitrogen, Melbourne, Australia). Competent cells (TOP 10; Invitrogen, Melbourne, Australia) used in cloning experiments were cultured on Luria-Bertani Agar (LB Agar; Sigma, Castle Hill, Australia) supplemented with 100 &#956;g/mL ampicillin. X-gal (40 &#956;l of 20 mg/ml) was spread onto LB agar plates for blue-white discrimination. Clones were grown at 37&#176;C overnight. Clones were picked using a sterile disposable loop and plated onto LB agar. These confirmed white clones were also used for screening by direct lysis PCR and for storage.\nDirect lysis PCR of clones and sequencing\nThe reaction volume was scaled down to 25 &#956;L, with the same reaction conditions as above. Use of plasmid-specific primers SP6 and T7 (Table 1) enabled the sim gene inserts to be amplified. Agarose gel electrophoresis allowed determination of clones with inserts, from which plasmids were extracted using a commercial kit in accordance with the manufacturers instructions (Invitrogen, Melbourne, Australia) for sequencing with plasmid primers SP6 and T7 (Table 1). Sequencing of the full length of the sim genes was initially facilitated with the primer SIM F (Table 1).\nGenome Walking and \nSequences upstream and downstream of the sim gene were obtained by genome walking according to the manufacturer's instructions (Genome Walker Kit, Clontech, Mountain View, Ca.). Gene specific primers used for genome walking upstream of the sim gene were SIM WR and SIM W2R (Table 1) and SIM WF and SIM W3F (Table 1). Resultant PCR products were gel-purified and ligated into TOPO vector PCRII (Invitrogen, Melbourne, Australia). Sequencing was carried out with SP6 and T7 primers on recombinant clones. This allowed primers to be designed (PRE SIM and POST SIM; Table 1) for the amplification of the sim genes and the surrounding spacers from additional strains (Table 2) to examine sim gene diversity. The same cycling parameters were used but with a 65&#176;C annealing temperature and use of a proofreading polymerase enzyme system (Prime STAR DNA polymerase, Takara, Shiga, Japan) to reduce the likelihood of incorporation errors. The PRE SIM primer was located in the multigene regulator gene (mgx) and included the first 36 nucleotides of the mgx gene in the amplicons and the POST SIM primer included the last 75 nucleotides of the putative tellurite/toxic anion resistance gene (telX). These PCR products were directly sequenced with the following primers: PRE SIM, SIM R, SIM 2R, SIM F, SIM 2F, SIM 3F, SIM W2R, and POST SIM (Table 1). Additionally, primers M141 F and SIM3 F RC were used to generate sequence data from isolate QMA0141.\nExpression of SiM proteins\nM proteins were cloned for expression using the Champion pET system (pET101/D-TOPO; Invitrogen, Melbourne, Australia) and subsequently expressed in E. coli BL21 Star (DE3) One Shot chemically competent cells (Invitrogen, Melbourne, Australia) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Representatives of the different sim sequevars recovered were expressed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Representative isolates of the different sim genes QMA0072, QMA0076, and QMA0141 had their full proteins expressed.To confirm fibrinogen binding activity of recombinantly expressed proteins, a Western blotting procedure was used. Lysates of recombinant E. coli described above were separated by SDS-PAGE in resolving gels containing 10% acrylamide under reducing and non-reducing conditions. Resolved IPTG-induced cellular lysates were blotted onto PVDF membranes using a semi dry apparatus (Hoeffer Semi-Phor, GE Healthcare, North Ryde, NSW), the membranes were probed with biotinylated fibrinogen (5 &#956;g/mL) prepared as described above and detected using streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase (Pierce, Rockford, Il.) followed by colour development using 1-Step NBT-BCIP (Pierce, Rockford Il.).\nNucleotide Sequence Accession Numbers\nGenBank accession numbers for sequences from this study are EU287919&#8211;EU287923.\nAuthors' contributions\nJCFB discovered, characterised, and expressed the sim genes, discovered the surrounding genes, designed new molecular materials, drafted the manuscript and supervised AU. RAT contributed with macrophage assays and drafted part of the manuscript. AU contributed with PAGE and detection of proteins on western blots. ACB designed the study, conducted the fibrinogen binding assays, supervised RAT and revised the final manuscript.

The size variation of CagA gene, which is dependent on the 3&#8217; repeat region, contains one or more Glu-Pro-Ile-Tyr-Ala (EPIYA) motifs and CagA multimerization (CM) motifs. Four segments flanking the EPIYA motifs, EPIYA &#8722;A, &#8722;B, &#8722;C, or &#8722;D, were reported to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of H. pylori infection. The aim was to determine the roles of EPIYA segments and CM motifs in gastroduodenal pathogenesis in an Iraqi population.Patients and Methods:\nGastric biopsies were collected from 210 patients with gastritis, duodenal ulcer (DU), gastric ulcer (GU), and gastric cancer (GC).

The GenBank accession numbers for the partial CagA nucleotide sequences determined in this study are JX164093-JX164112.", "body": "PATIENTS AND METHODS\n\nPatient-derived samples\nA total of 210 Iraqi patients (79 men and 113 women), mean age, 44.4 &#177; 1.6 years with dyspeptic symptoms, who underwent endoscopy in Al-Kadhimiya teaching hospital and Al-yarmook hospital at Baghdad, Iraq between June 2010 and August 2011 were included. The endoscopic was grouped into three categories: Peptic ulcer [gastric ulcer (GU) and duodenal ulcer (DU)], GC and non-nuclear dyspepdiagnosissia (NUD). NUD patients were defined as patients who had no endoscopic lesions of ulcers and/or malignancies. After endoscopic examination, the gastric biopsy specimens from the antrum were examined for the presence of H. pylori by rapid urease test and PCR. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics and Research Committees of the hospital, and all patients gave informed consent to the study.\nProcessing of the samples for PCR assay\nOne antral biopsy specimen from each person was kept in normal saline (0.9% sodium chloride) and preserved immediately at &#8722;80&#176;C for molecular analysis.Each frozen biopsy specimen was thawed, crushed and then genomic DNA was extracted directly from gastric biopsy samples using the QIAamp tissue DNA extraction kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The extracted DNA then quantified through measurement of its OD260 by ND-2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific Inc., USA). The extracted DNA was eluted in 200 &#956;L of 1XTE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA [pH 8.0]) and stored at &#8722;20&#176;C until use.\nPCR amplification analysis\nFor confirming the presence of H. pylori DNA in biopsy, ureC (glmM) gene was identified by PCR using primer pairs: ureCF and ureCR with a 296-bp size product, as described previously.[15] For detecting the presence of the CagA gene, PCR amplification of CagA used previously described primers (CagAF1) and (CagAR1)[16] that amplified the 5&#8242; conserved region of the CagA gene with a 349-bp size product.\nCharacterization of the C-terminal variable region by EPIYA motif\nThe forward primer CagA28F and reverse primers CagA-P1C, [CagA-P2GC and CagA-P2TA] (equimolar mixture), CagA-P3E, as described previously[10] and CagA-PD[17] were used to amplify the EPIYA motif encoding sequences A, B, C, and D, respectively. PCR amplification of CagA (The entire 3&#8242; variable region) used previously described primers cag2 and cag4.[18]All PCR was performed in a volume of 25 &#956;L using GoTaq &#174; Green Master Mix (Promega) containing 10 &#215; PCR buffer, 3 mmol/L MgCl 2 ; 400 &#956;M each deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate (dNTP), 1.5 U Taq DNA polymerase, 10 pmol of each primer, and 200 ng DNA sample. PCR was performed in a thermocycler (MJ MINI, Bio-Rad, France) under the following conditions: initial denaturation for 5 min at 94&#176;C was followed by 35 cycles of 93&#176;C for 1 min, 55&#176;C for 30 s, and 72&#176;C for 1 min. After a final extension at 72&#176;C for 10 min, the PCR products were examined by electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gels for 1 h at 60V. H. pylori 26695 were used as control strain.\nSequencing of the 3\u2032 variable region of \nPCR products for the entire 3&#8242; variable region of the CagA gene were purified using the QIA Quick Gel Extraction kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Purified products were sent to Eton Bioscience Inc., USA for sequencing in both directions. Oligonucleotide screening by BLAST analysis was used to identify H. pylori\nCagA peptide sequences. Alignment of partial CagA peptide sequences was carried out using CLUSTAL W. The previously published CagA gene sequence of strains H. pylori 26695 (AE000511) in GenBank was also included in the analysis.\nStatistical analysis\nThe differences in age, gender, and CagA EPIYA motifs of H. pylori between GC, DU, GU and gastritis patients were analyzed using a &#967;2-test. Statistical significance was set at P &#8804; 0.01.\nRESULTS\nOut of 210 gastric biopsy specimens, 102 (48.57%) were confirmed to have gastric H. pylori infection by RUT and ureC gene [Figure 1]. Of them, 58 (56.86%) patients were male and 44 (43.13%) were female with a mean age of 43.10 years (range 15-72 years). Out of 102 H. pylori-positive samples, 40 (39.22%) were CagA-positive gene [Figure 2] including 6/34 (17.6%) from gastritis patients, 10/23 (43.4%) from GU patients, 21/45 (46.7%) from DU patients and all 3 GC patients (100%). A significant association was found between CagA status and clinical outcome for patients (P &#8804; 0.01).The entire 3&#8242; variable region of the CagA gene was amplified with Cag 2, and Cag 4 primers determined the molecular weight resulting fragments for CagA regions varied between 450 and 850 bp. There was single-band PCR product in 32 cases and double-band product in 8 cases [Figure 3].These eight strains were thought to have at least two kinds of strains within the same patient. We successfully separated those subclones by eluted and purified by using QIA Quick DNA Gel Extraction kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). The purification process was successfully conducted on the samples in which only one fragment was found and the purified DNA of these eight cases were classified with regards to EPIYA types [Table 1].Among 48 CagA-positive strains, EPIYA typing PCR showed that 22 (45.8%) strains had three copies of EPIYA (ABC type), 2 (4.16%) had four copies (ABCC type), 6 (12.7%) had five copies (ABCCC type), and 13 (27.08%) had two copies (AB type), while the remaining 3 (6.25%) had the BC, 2 (4.17%) had AC motif [Figure 4]. There were no East Asian type strains with EPIYA-D segments in the Iraqi population [Figure 5]. Statistical analysis was carried out by comparing the number of EPIYA-C motifs of strains isolated from GU, DU and GC patients with those of gastritis patients [Table 2]. We found a significant association between the increase in the number of EPIYA-C motifs (&#8805;2) and GU and GC (P &#8804; 0.01) compared with gastritis. Otherwise, the number of EPIYA-C motifs did not associate with DU, indicating predictive association with the severity of the disease.\nSequencing of the 3\u2032 variable region of \nFor comparing and achievement of more details of the 3&#8242; end variable region of the CagA gene in the Iraqi population, Nuclolide sequencing of the CagA variable regions was performed for 20 randomly selected strains (IRQ1-IRQ20) including 6 from Gastritis, 5 from GU, 7 from DU, and 2 from GC patients. Sequence analyses confirmed that three types of EPIYA motifs were observed: EPIYA-A for EPIY (A/T) KVNKKK (A/T) GQ; EPIYA-B for EPIY (A/T) QVAKKVNAKI; and EPIYA-C for EPIYATIDDLGGPFPL, it has been found no strains possessed the East Asian type of EPIYA-D (EPIYATIDFDEANQAG). We confirmed that PCR methods correctly classified the EPIYA motif types (i.e., strain IRQ8-17 possessed AC type, strain IRQ20-85 possessed ABCCC type, and other strains sequenced ABC type by PCR; the data are identical to data by sequencing). We also found that all cases in EPIYA-A and EPIYA-C were exact EPIYA sequences; however, 5 of 20 cases in EPIYA-A and EPIYA-B were EPIYT, but not EPIYA. The CM motif located within the EPIYA-C segment had the peptide sequence found in strains from Western countries FPLKRHDKVDDLSKVG. We also found that CM motif located upstream of the EPIYA-C segment varied at positions 16 in strain IRQ7-101, FPLKRHDKVDDLSKVR and varied at positions 5 in strain IRQ17-71, FPLKKHDKVDDLSKVG and CM motif located upstream the last EPIYA-C motif in strain IRQ20-85 FPLKRHDKVDDLSKVE and downstream of same EPIYA FPLKRHDKVDDLSKVD [Figure 6].\nDISCUSSION\nIn this study, we examined CagA C-terminal variations in H. pylori strains from Iraqi patients. We found that the C-terminal region varied considerably in size, from 450 to 850 bp. Variation in the size of CagA is due to the presence of a variable number of repeat sequences including EPIYA motifs and CM motifs located in the 3&#8242; region of the gene. Encoded in their CagA 3&#8217; end, Iraqi H. pylori strains had one to three EPIYA-C motifs in an ABC, ABCC, and ABCCC CagA pattern. In the present study, we found that there were no strains with EPIYA-D segments, in agreement with a study examining Iraqi (Kurdistan region) strains.[14] The absence of ABD type CagA might be the reason for lower incidence of GC in Iraq. The incidence of GC in Iraq is unusually rare (age-standardized rate [ASR] for men 5/105 ), which is much lower than that in East Asian countries (e.g., Japan 69.2/10 5 and South Korea 70.02/10 5 ),[19&#8211;21] despite the country's geographical proximity to Turkey and Iran, where the incidence of GC differs hugely among these countries, being 8.9-14.1/10 5 and 38-69/10 5 , respectively.[2223]The prevalence of strains with more than one repeat region (i.e., more than one EPIYA-C; e.g., ABCC) was 51.1% in Colombia and 33.3% in Italy,[24] which was much higher than in the current study (16.75%) and in one Iraqi study no strain was found to have more than three phosphorylation motifs (0%). It might be simply due to small number of severe diseases in the study by Hussein et al,[14] (e.g., 20 cases with peptic ulcer disease (PUD) and 29 cases with non-PUD). Low prevalence of strains with multiple EPIYA-C segments might be reasons for low incidence of GC in Iraq. Therefore, EPIYA motif diversity may prove useful in the prediction of H. pylori pathogenic activity, and the accurate determination of the type and number of EPIYA motifs in clinical H. pylori isolates can become a useful prognostic tool.[24]Somewhat interestingly, the mean age of patients infected with ABCC type and ABCCC type strains were higher than those with other types. As suggested by Yamaoka et al,[25] the level of acid production increases in advanced age and it is possible that strains with higher number of EPIYA C segments may be less resistant to the acid.Zhang et al., recently found that increased numbers of EPIYA motifs in H. pylori infection alone is not the onlyindependent factor for the development of GC.[1] H. pylori virule nce factors, smoking, gender, host genetic, environmental, and dietary factors play a major role in determining whether or not a person infected with H. pylori will develop GC.[1] Moreover, another possibility as reported by Acosta, et al,[26] using site-specific mutagenesis, suggests that tyrosine phosphorylation at EPIYA-C is sufficient, but not exclusive, to activate translocated CagA, suggesting that other motifs besides EPIYA-C are used for phosphorylation of CagA proteins as well. For this reason it is not only important to study the tyrosine phosphorylation motif, EPIYA, but also another important amino acid sequence, Multimerization motif (CM motif), which surrounds the EPIYA-C motif and EPIYA-D in Western and East Asian CagA species.[1] The most common Western CagA-ABC, possesses two identical CM sequences (FPLKRHDKVDDLSKVG, referred to as W-CM sequence). In contrast, East Asian CagA-ABD carries a single CM sequence (FPLRRSAAVNDLSKVG, referred to as E-CM sequence) located immediately after the EPIYA-D segment.[827]The type and number of CM motifs may influence the potential of individual CagA proteins to multimerize in host cells, and this may affect the ability of CagA to disturb host cell function via SHP-2 deregulation.[27] Some studies have reported important proinflammatory and prooncogenic activities of CagA that are independent of the EPIYA motifs, but which may be as important for disease incidence.[2427]In the present report, we have shown that in 85% of CagA-positive strains, the CM motifs had the peptide sequence FPLKRHDKVDDLSKVG, typically found in H. pylori strains from Western countries and we found different types of CM motifs in 3 (15%) strains, which vary from the sequence supposed for W-CM. The two modified W-CM motifs of H. pylori in strain IRQ20-85 are not registered in database, isolated from patient suffering from GC. These findings indicate that there is explicit positive correlation between the number and type of CM motifs and various gastroduodenal diseases associated to H. pylori infection.In conclusion, the structure of the 3&#8242; region of the CagA gene in Iraqi strains was Western type with a variable number of EPIYA-C and CM motifs.

This study suggested that lacunes on thalamus played a vital role in mediating the neural functional changes of CSVD patients.", "body": "Introduction\nCerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) is the most common vascular cause of dementia, which included several types of neuroimaging features on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): recent small subcortical infarcts, white matter hyperintensities (WMH), lacunes, prominent perivascular spaces, cerebral microbleeds, and atrophy.[1] Among all those features, WMH and lacunes have consistently been shown to be associated with covert neurological and cognitive symptoms in previous studies.[2,3] Especially, previous studies have indicated that the spatial distribution of lacunes played a more important role in determining cognitive outcome than lesion load (eg, number and volume).[4,5] The underlying mechanism may be due to the disruption of several cortical-subcortical pathways which connecting the networks that underlie cognitive processes.[4]The thalamus is a complex structure possessing unique connectional properties with prefrontal, temporal, occipital, and insular area.[6] Thalamic lacunes have been determined as &#8220;strategic&#8221; lacunes and associated with impaired cognitive performance, irrelevant of WMH.[4,7] Although small infarcts on thalamus have been reported to interrupt fiber projections and associate with cognitive decline,[8&#8211;10] lacunes on the thalamus has not been separated from those without in CSVD patients, especially those with very mild cognitive impairment.The recent development of resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) has provided valuable insights into the pathomechanism of cognitive impairment and allowed us to detect intrinsic brain activity noninvasively. Conjunction with the graph-based network theory, brain networks have been described as graphs in which anatomic brain regions are defined as nodes linked by edges and direct noninvasive characterization of brain network topologic organization has been described.[11] This method has shown good performance in determining the cognitive impairment in patients with type 2 diabetes,[12] Parkinson disease,[13] and Alzheimer's disease.[14] In CSVD patients, intrinsic brain connectivity at rest or functional connectome has been analyzed using rs-fMRI in previous studies.[5,15&#8211;17] However, those studies have not separated CSVD patients with thalamus lacunes from those without, which may result in a confusion of the functional disruption. The alteration of large-scale functional brain networks in CSVD patients with thalamus lacunes, especially those with mild cognitive impairment, have not been fully elucidated and associated with cognitive symptoms.In this cross-sectional study, CSVD patients with mild cognitive impairment, were classified into those with thalamus lacunes and those without, which have been matched with the extent of WMH. We aimed to investigate the functional connectome alterations in CSVD patients with or without thalamus lacunes respect to healthy controls (HC). The hypothesis of this study was that the brain functional connectome in CSVD patients with thalamus lacunes was perturbed, but not so much for those without, and the alterations have been correlated with cognitive impairment.\nMaterials and methods\n\nParticipants\nThis cross-sectional study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Tongji hospital, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants before enrollment.We enrolled patients diagnosed with CSVD from March 2014 to January 2016 from the outpatient. Patient inclusion criteria were as follows:The CSVD patients were further subdivided into 2 groups whether the thalamus had lacunes or not according to their MRI findings.Exclusion criteria included:In addition, 35 HC subjects without lacunes or moderate to severe WMH were recruited. The control subjects also underwent a brief clinical interview and MMSE to confirm that they satisfied the criteria.Subjects included in further analyses had to satisfy the criteria for head movement (less than 2&#8202;mm translation in any axis and less than 2&#176; angular rotation about any axis) during rs-fMRI scanning. Two CSVD participants who had excessive head motion during scanning and 1 healthy subject who did not have a complete set of MRI data due to technical problems were excluded, resulting in a sample of 14 CSVD patients with thalamus lacunes, 27 CSVD patients without thalamus lacunes and 34 HC. The demographic and psychological characteristics of the samples are summarized in Table 1.\nNeuropsychological tests\nAll subjects were right-handed and able to perform the neuropsychological tests. These participants were administered a battery of neuropsychological assessments, including 4 cognitive domains: MMSE, episodic memory (EM) (the auditory verbal learning test short and long delay recall [AVLT]), processing speed (PS) (the trails making test form A [TMT-A]), executive function (the trails making test form B [TMT-B]; and the verbal fluency test [VFT]). The neuropsychological tests were conducted by a neuropsychologist with 10 years&#8217; experience (W. Z).\nData acquisition and preprocessing\nMRI data were acquired using a 3.0T MR scanner (Discovery MR750; GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI) with 32-channel head array coil. The neuroimaging protocol included T1WI, T2-weighted images (T2WI), T2-fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (T2FLAIR), high-resolution 3D T1-weighted images, and rs-fMRI sequences. T2-FLAIR images were acquired using repetition time (TR)&#8202;=&#8202;8000&#8202;ms, echo time (TE)&#8202;=&#8202;160&#8202;ms, inversion time (TI)&#8202;=&#8202;2100&#8202;ms, flip angle (FA)&#8202;=&#8202;111&#176;, slice thickness&#8202;=&#8202;5.0&#8202;mm, slice gap&#8202;=&#8202;1.5&#8202;mm, data matrix&#8202;=&#8202;512&#8202;&#215;&#8202;512, and field of view (FOV)&#8202;=&#8202;240&#8202;&#215;&#8202;240&#8202;mm2. High-resolution 3D T1-weighted images were obtained using a sagittal brain volume sequence with TR&#8202;=&#8202;8.16&#8202;ms, TE&#8202;=&#8202;3.18&#8202;ms, TI&#8202;=&#8202;450&#8202;ms, FA&#8202;=&#8202;12&#176;, number of slices&#8202;=&#8202;188, slice thickness&#8202;=&#8202;1.0&#8202;mm, data matrix&#8202;=&#8202;256&#8202;&#215;&#8202;256, and FOV&#8202;=&#8202;256&#8202;&#215;&#8202;256&#8202;mm2. Rs-fMRI was obtained using an axial gradient echo-planar imaging sequence with TR&#8202;=&#8202;2000&#8202;ms, TE&#8202;=&#8202;35&#8202;ms, FA&#8202;=&#8202;90&#176;, number of slices&#8202;=&#8202;36, slice thickness&#8202;=&#8202;3.0&#8202;mm, slice gap&#8202;=&#8202;1.0&#8202;mm, data matrix&#8202;=&#8202;64&#8202;&#215;&#8202;64, FOV&#8202;=&#8202;220&#8202;&#215;&#8202;220&#8202;mm2, scan time&#8202;=&#8202;7&#8202;minutes, and 210 volumes for each subject. Subjects were asked to relax with their eyes closed without falling asleep during the scan. Foam pads and earplugs were used to minimize head movement and scanner noise.We used software statistical parametric mapping 8 (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/) to perform image preprocessing of rs-fMRI data. The first 10 volumes for each subject were discarded. Head motion parameters were estimated, and each volume was realigned to the mean whole volume map to correct for geometrical displacements using a 6-parameter rigid-body transformation. Data were excluded from further analysis if their maximum displacement in any of the orthogonal directions (x, y, z) was greater than 2&#8202;mm or if there was a maximum rotation (x, y, z) greater than 2.0&#176;. Individual functional images were spatially normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute space. The functional images were then re-sampled into a voxel size of 3&#8202;&#215;&#8202;3&#8202;&#215;&#8202;3&#8202;mm3 and spatially smoothed with a 6-mm full width at half-maximum Gaussian kernel. Finally, the datasets were bandpass filtered with frequencies ranging from 0.01 to 0.08&#8202;Hz, and several nuisance covariates (6 motion parameters and average blood oxygen level-dependent signals of the ventricular and white matter) were regressed out from the data.\nAssessment of WMH and lacunes\nThe extent of WMH was visually rated on T2-FLAIR images according to the Fazekas rating scale. The final score was the sum of the subcortical WMH score (0-absent, 1-punctuate foci, 2-beginning confluence of foci, 3-large confluent areas) and the periventricular WMH score (0-absent, 1-caps or pencil lining, 2-smooth halo, 3-irregular periventricular hyperintensities extending into deep white matter).[1,18] Moderate or severe WMH was defined as a rating score of three or higher.[18] Lacunes were counted using the combination of T1WI, T2WI, and T2-FLAIR, with the definition of a round or ovoid, subcortical, fluid-filled cavity (signal similar to cerebrospinal fluid) of between 3&#8202;mm and 15&#8202;mm in diameter.[1] The evaluation of WMH and lacunes were conducted by 2 neuroradiologists with 8- and 5-years&#8217; experiences respectively (C. L and Z. W).\nNetwork construction and analysis\nFunctional brain networks were constructed by calculating pairwise Pearson Correlation Coefficients among 90 regions of interest in terms of the anatomical automatic labeling atlas. A sparsity threshold S was then used to convert each of the resulting correlation matrices into a series of weighted networks (0.05 &#8804; S &#8804; 0.5, interval&#8202;=&#8202;0.05). For the brain networks at each sparsity level, we calculated both global and nodal network metrics and then the area under the curve over the sparsity range. The global network metrics were of 2 kinds: small-world parameters (for definitions see Watts and Strogatz[19]) including the clustering coefficient, characteristic path length, normalized clustering coefficient (&#947;), normalized characteristic path length (&#955;), and small-worldness (&#963;); and network efficiency parameters (for definitions see Latora and Marchiori[20]) including the local efficiency and global efficiency. The nodal centrality metrics were the nodal degree,[11] nodal efficiency,[21] and nodal betweenness.[22]To locate the specific pairs of brain regions with altered functional connectivity, we identified region pairs that exhibited between-group differences in nodal characteristics and then used the network-based statistics method (http://www.nitrc.org/projects/nbs/)[23] to define a set of suprathreshold significant changes between any connected regions (P&#8202;<&#8202;.05, threshold T&#8202;=&#8202;2.02). Statistical significance was estimated by using the nonparametric permutation method (10,000 permutations).\nStatistical analysis\nThe analyses of demographic, clinical and MRI data were performed with software (SPSS version 16.0). Normality was checked using the Kolmogorov&#8211;Smirnov test. The group differences were explored by using Student t test if normally distributed, and Mann&#8211;Whitney U test if not (eg, lacunes numbers and Fazekas scores). Categorical data (gender) were analyzed with a &#967;2 test. To address the problem of multiple comparisons of nodal metrics, we adopted a Benjamini&#8211;Hochberg false discovery rate correction method at a significance value of 0.05. Finally, in CSVD patients with thalamus lacunes, Pearson correlations were computed to examine relationships between these values and MMSE, AVLT (short and long delay recall), TMT-A, TMT-B, and VFT.\nResults\n\nDemographic and clinical comparisons\nDemographic and clinical data from 41 CSVD patients (14 with and 27 without thalamus lacunes) and 34 HC participants are summarized in Table 1. Age, sex, and education did not differ significantly between the patients and the HC group (P&#8202;>&#8202;.05). The CSVD subjects, with thalamus lacunes or without, both exhibited reduced cognitive performance (MMSE, EM, PS, and executive function) relative to HC (P&#8202;<&#8202;.05). More interestingly, though there was no significant difference for the extent of WMH (P&#8202;=&#8202;.067) between 2 CSVD patient groups, the total number of lacunes in the group with thalamus lacunes were larger than the group without (P&#8202;=&#8202;.001).\nGlobal topologic organization of the functional connectome\nIn the defined threshold range, both patient group and HC participants showed small world topologic organization in the brain functional connectome. Compared with HC, CSVD patients with thalamus lacunes showed a significant decrease in the global efficiency (P&#8202;=&#8202;.039), and an increase in the characteristic path length (P&#8202;=&#8202;.040), with no significant differences in local efficiency (P&#8202;=&#8202;.066), clustering coefficient (P&#8202;=&#8202;.082) (Fig. 1 and Table 2), normalized clustering coefficient &#947; (P&#8202;=&#8202;.193), normalized characteristic path length &#955; (P&#8202;=&#8202;.055), or small-worldness &#963; (P&#8202;=&#8202;.260). CSVD patients without thalamus lacunes exhibited no significant changes in all the indexes relative to HC (P&#8202;>&#8202;.05) but showed a similar tendency as patients with thalamus lacunes.\nRegional topologic organization of the functional connectome\nAmong all the nodal centrality metrics, only the node degree and node efficiency showed significant between-group differences after multiple comparison correction (P&#8202;<&#8202;.05, false discovery rate (FDR) corrected). Specifically, compared with HC participants, CSVD patients with thalamus lacunes showed decreased node degree in the right olfactory, the left rectus, the right rectus, the left middle cingulum, and the left pallidum (Fig. 2 and Table 3), as well as decreased nodal efficiency in the left rectus, the right rectus, the left middle cingulum, and the left pallidum (P&#8202;&#8202;.05). There were no significant changes in any nodal metric between CSVD patients without thalamus lacunes and HC group.\nCSVD-related alterations in functional connectivity\nThe network-based statistics method identified a significantly altered network in CSVD patients with thalamus lacunes (P&#8202;<&#8202;.05, threshold T&#8202;=&#8202;2.02). This network had 6 nodes and 13 connections (Fig. 2), mainly involved in limbic, paralimbic (prefrontal and frontal, red and yellow), and subcortical (blue) regions. Within this network, all the connections were decreased in patients compared with HC participants. No significant differences were identified between CSVD patients without thalamus lacunes and HC group.\nCorrelation analysis\nWithin the group of CSVD patients with thalamus lacunes, no significant correlation was found for any nodal metrics (P&#8202;>&#8202;.05). Among all the 13 connections, only 2 connections had significant correlation with EM and PS, respectively (Fig. 3). Specifically, the connectivity strength of the right olfactory &#8211; right rectus was negatively correlated with AVLT-long delay recall (A: r&#8202;=&#8202;&#8722;0.562; P&#8202;=&#8202;.037, representing EM). The connectivity strength of the right olfactory &#8211; left pallidum was negatively correlated with AVLT-short delay recall (B: r&#8202;=&#8202;&#8722;0.674; P&#8202;=&#8202;.008, representing EM), and positively correlated with TMT-A (C: r&#8202;=&#8202;0.586; P&#8202;=&#8202;.028, representing PS).\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we used rs-fMRI and network analysis to explore the topological organization of functional brain networks in CSVD patients with mild cognitive impairment. Compared with HC, CSVD patients with thalamus lacunes had increased characteristic path length and decreased global efficiency, implying a disturbance of the normal global integration of whole-brain network. At the nodal level, decreased nodal degree and nodal efficiency in several brain regions have been detected, involving the limbic, paralimbic, and subcortical pallidum regions. Furthermore, networks were less densely connected in CSVD patients with thalamus lacunes, with the connectivity strength of the olfactory &#8211; rectus in right hemisphere and the right olfactory &#8211; left pallidum significantly related to cognitive impairment. However, CSVD patients without thalamus lacunes showed no significant alterations relative to HC at global, nodal or edge level. These findings provide insights into the neurobiology of CSVD patients from a network perspective and aid development of new biomarkers of disease detection at early stage.In the framework of graph theory, a network is declared to be small-world when it attains a balance between local specialization (indexed by a high clustering coefficient) and global integration (indexed by low characteristic path length).[19] In our study, the brain networks of both patients with CSVD and HC participants exhibited small worldness. Regarding global topologic properties, global efficiency was decreased whereas characteristic path length was increased in CSVD patients with thalamus lacunes compared with HC participants, but not for those without thalamus lacunes, indicating that the brain networks may fail to maintain global integration as the lacunes involved thalamus particularly. The location of lacunes within subcortical grey matter, in particular the thalamus, has been reported to be a determinant of cognitive impairment.[7] However, our study also found that CSVD patients with thalamus lacunes had higher total number of lacunes. Since the effect of lacune location may also partly combined with the potential influence of the number of lacunes, a much larger sample with better-balanced groups would be required to demonstrate if thalamic lacunes play some specific role in cognitive impairment through specifics of connections in future work. The decreased global network efficiency may be the consequence of CSVD-related disruptions of interregional coordination, as demonstrated by our nodal efficiency and functional connectivity analyses and also as reported in recent studies.[15] In addition, the global efficiency was significantly decreased in CSVD patients with thalamus lacunes but no significant decrease in local efficiency, indicating that lacunes on thalamus may had more impact on long-range connection (mainly related to global efficiency) than short-range connection.Other than these altered global topologic properties, CSVD patients with thalamus lacunes also showed impaired nodal centralities of several regions in the functional connectome, including limbic, paralimbic (prefrontal and frontal), and subcortical pallidum regions. Decreased nodal centralities in the limbic and paralimbic regions were in accordance with the mild cognitive impairment of CSVD patients. Abnormalities in white matter integrity and specific functional network alterations have been reported in patients with thalamus lacunes.[4] Resting-state thalamus functional connectivity with a set of brain regions have been disrupted in CSVD patients.[5] Particularly, left thalamic infarction can cause frontal dysfunction through the &#8220;diaschisis.&#8221;[24] Our observation of decreased nodal centralities in the prefrontal regions is congruent with neuropathologic observations that thalamus lacunes may disrupt the cortical-subcortical-thalamus circuit, which involved the cognitive process closely.[25]We identified a CSVD-related subnetwork composed of 6 brain regions with 13 connections, mainly involving the prefrontal &#8211; subcortical pathways. These regions all showed decreased connectivity strength in patients with thalamus lacunes. Specifically, we observed a significant negative association between the connectivity strength of the right olfactory &#8211; right rectus and AVLT-long delay recall score, as well as between the connectivity strength of the right olfactory &#8211; left pallidum and AVLT-short delay recall score, implying lower connectivity strength of those regions in patients with worse EM. We also observed a significant positive association between the connectivity strength of right olfactory &#8211; left pallidum and TMT-A score implying higher connectivity strength in patients with a better performance on measures of PS. Our observations were consistent with previous task-based and rs-fMRI studies which reported abnormal frontal-subcortical circuit in patients with CSVD.[26] Therefore, our findings suggested that the mild cognitive impairment in CSVD could be explained by the imbalance between the limbic and frontal networks, and the frontal-subcortical circuit may be at the root of the pathogenesis of CSVD with thalamus lacunes.The present study has several limitations. First, we only enrolled CSVD patients that not demented. The very mild cognitive impairment in CSVD patients without thalamus lacunes may resulted the negative results relative to HC. Second, the number of patients with thalamus lacunes was relatively small. Since the recruited CSVD patients were heterogeneous in terms of the lacune locations outside the thalamus as well as the total number of lacunes, we did not compare the two-patient group directly. Theoretically, further studies should subdivide CSVD patients into several subgroups according to different location of lacunes, which need much larger database. Third, severe WMH have been associated with cognitive dysfunction. Although we matched the extent of WMH in the 2 groups of CSVD patients, subtle influence from WMH could not be fully excluded. Fourth, for graph-based brain network studies, there is still not an optimum method for generating brain parcellations for node definition. Further studies are needed to determine which brain parcellation strategy or spatial scale is most appropriate for the characterization of network topology in CSVD patients. Fifth, physiologic noise, including respiratory and cardiac fluctuations, might have compromised our results.In summary, the functional connectome of CSVD patients with mild cognitive impairment, especially those with thalamus lacunes, shows a shift toward &#8220;regularization,&#8221; supporting the idea that this is a general pattern in CSVD. It is of much interest that the functional connectivity strength of frontal-limbic pathways in CSVD patients with thalamus lacunes was associated with worse cognitive performance than those without. The results of our study indicate that thalamus lacune was a pessimistic marker of cognitive performance in CSVD patients, which might help to define early interventions to attenuate adverse brain development in the non-demented CSVD patients.\nAuthor contributions\nData curation: Wenhao Zhu, Zhenxiong Wang.Formal analysis: Wenhao Zhu.Funding acquisition: Yuanyuan Qin.Investigation: Wenhao Zhu.Methodology: Chengxia Liu.Project administration: Zhenxiong Wang, Wenzhen Zhu.Resources: Zhenxiong Wang.Software: Chengxia Liu, Zhenxiong Wang.Supervision: Wenzhen Zhu.Visualization: Chengxia Liu.Writing &#8211; original draft: Yuanyuan Qin.Writing &#8211; review & editing: Chengxia Liu, Wenzhen Zhu.Yuanyuan Qin orcid: 0000-0002-0673-3200.", "pmid": "31577703", "title": "Functional brain connectome and its relation to mild cognitive impairment in cerebral small vessel disease patients with thalamus lacunes", "journal_title": "Medicine", "authors": "Yuanyuan Qin;Wenhao Zhu;Chengxia Liu;Zhenxiong Wang;Wenzhen Zhu", "doi": "10.1097/MD.0000000000017127", "score": "0.0102026"}, {"keywords": "Rectal temperature;Tympanic temperature;Sensitivity;Specificity;Predictive values;Term neonates", "abstract": "Background\nTympanic thermometry has come as a suitable alternative to traditional thermometry because of its safety and ease of use. However, it is still yet to gain wide acceptance in African settings due to conflicting results on its accuracy, thus rectal thermometry remains the gold standard in the newborn. The aim of this study was to compare tympanic and rectal temperatures in term Nigerian neonates.Methods\nRectal and tympanic temperatures were measured simultaneously in 300 consecutive term neonates between the ages of 37 and 42&#8201;weeks gestation using mercury-in-glass and the Infrared tympanic thermometers respectively. Paired t test, Pearson correlation coefficient and the Bland-Altman plot were used to compute data. Using rectal thermometry as gold standard, the sensitivity, specificity and predictive values of tympanic thermometry at various rectal temperature cut-offs were determined. Receiver Operating Curves (ROC) were constructed and the Areas Under the Curves (AUC) were compared.Results\nThe mean rectal temperature (37.34&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.55&#176;C) was significantly higher than the mean tympanic temperature (37.25&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.56&#176;C) (p&#8201;<&#8201;0.001) with a mean difference of 0.09&#8201;&#176;C&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.24&#8201;&#176;C (95% CI: 0.06, 0.12). There was a strong positive correlation between the two measurements (r&#8201;=&#8201;0.9; p&#8201;<&#8201;0.001). Tympanic thermometry showed sensitivities ranging from 65% to 86% and specificities of 95% to 99% at rectal temperature cut-offs of 37.5&#176;C to 38&#176;C. The positive and negative predictive values of the tympanic temperatures at the various temperature cut-offs ranged from 82% to 93% and 80% to 98% respectively. Accuracy was noted to increase with higher temperatures as shown by the Receiver Operating Curves with the highest accuracy at the temperature cut-off of 38&#176;C and AUC of 0.91.Conclusions\nThe sensitivity of tympanic thermometry was relatively low in detecting rectal temperatures despite the good correlation and agreement between them. The specificities and predictive values of tympanic temperatures in detecting rectal temperatures were high and accuracy increased with higher temperatures. Though using the tympanic route for measuring temperature in the newborn is relatively safe and non-invasive, its low sensitivity limits its use. Further studies would be required to further assess the accuracy of tympanic temperature measurements in the newborn.", "body": "Background\nThe measurement of body temperature is an important parameter in neonatal care as it is useful in the assessment of clinical state and necessary for the provision of appropriate nursing support. Many routes have been used to record body temperature in the newborn; however a consensus on the best site has not been reached [1]. The rectal route has been adjudged the most accurate as it has been found to accurately represent core temperatures [1,2].However, there are drawbacks to the use of the rectal route for temperature measurements in children. These include the risks of rectal perforation [3,4], transmission of infection [1,5,6] and mercury poisoning when mercury-in-glass thermometers are used [5,7,8]. Rectal temperature measurements have also been thought to lag behind core temperature measurements during periods of cold stress in shock states due to impaired perfusion to the rectum [1,2,5].Tympanic thermometry, however, has come as a newer and safer alternative to the traditional temperature measurements. It is an excellent site for the measurement of core temperature as it is readily accessible and shares the same blood supply as the hypothalamus [1,9]. The infrared tympanic thermometers are non-invasive [10], provide rapid readings within a few seconds [9-11] and are not affected by the presence of cerumen or otitis media [5]. Previous studies done in different settings have shown that rectal temperatures compared with tympanic temperatures could have strong correlation [12-17] and mean differences ranged from 0.29&#8201;&#176;C to 0.4&#8201;&#176;C [13,16]. Despite the good correlation, there are still controversies on the accuracy of tympanic thermometry in the reports of studies in children; neonatal period [2,14,16,18,19] and beyond [10-15,17]. This study aims to compare temperatures taken through the rectal and tympanic routes in term neonates to determine whether tympanic thermometry can accurately replace rectal temperature measurements as a sensitive and specific route of temperature measurement.\nMethods\nThis prospective cross sectional study was carried out at the University College Hospital, Ibadan, Nigeria over a 6&#8201;month period. Three hundred neonates, whose weights were appropriate for gestational age (37 and 42&#8201;weeks) admitted on the neonatal wards, lying in wards and emergency wards of the hospital were studied. Informed consent was obtained from the parents of the babies. Ethical approval was obtained from UI/UCH Ethics Committee (Approval number: UI/EC/09/0122). The children were seen between the hours of 8.00&#8201;am and 6.00&#8201;pm during periods of normal vital sign monitoring. Ambient temperatures throughout the study period ranged between 25&#8201;&#176;C and 34&#8201;&#176;C.Conventional mercury-in-glass thermometers were used for rectal temperature measurements while the Infrared tympanic thermometer (BRAUN&#174; Thermo scan ear thermometer model IRT 4520) was used for the tympanic temperature measurements. The neonates&#8217; body temperatures were taken simultaneously from the two sites by two independent observers. The principal investigator (corresponding author) took the tympanic temperature measurements while the assistant (nurse) who had been well trained, inserted the mercury-in-glass thermometers for rectal temperature measurement at the same time.In measuring temperatures, the anal openings of the babies were cleaned and a mercury-in-glass thermometer was lubricated with Vaseline and inserted within a depth of 2-3&#8201;cm into the rectum. The rectal thermometer was left for 3 minutes in the rectum to ensure stabilization before being read by the nurse. All the mercury-in-glass thermometers were shaken to decrease the reading to below 35&#176;C before each temperature measurement. Simultaneously, the Infrared tympanic thermometer with a probe cover was placed into the right external auditory canal after an ear tug to straighten the canal and directed towards the eye to a depth of 0.5 to 1&#8201;cm. The probe was held in the same position until a single beep was heard (usually about 2 seconds) signifying the end of the temperature measurement which was then read by the principal observer. The probe cover was discarded and a new one placed on the probe for the next measurement. After the tympanic temperature measurements, the ear was examined with an auroscope to rule out the presence of debris, meconium or pus. No case of otitis media was recorded in the 300 neonates recruited for the study.All the collected data were analyzed by an author who was blinded to the procedure. Statistical analysis was done using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) for Windows (Inc. Chicago USA, 2001). Paired t test was used to compare the mean temperature readings from the two routes. Correlation was determined by the Pearson correlation coefficient while the extent of agreement was assessed with the Bland-Altman plot. Using various rectal temperature cut-offs as gold standard from 37.5&#8201;&#176;C and at 0.1&#8201;&#176;C differences above that till 38&#8201;&#176;C, the sensitivities, specificities, positive and negative predictive values of tympanic temperatures were determined. Receiver Operating Curves (ROC) were drawn for the two temperature measurements and the Areas Under the Curve were compared. The level of significance was taken to be p&#8201;<&#8201;0.05.\nResults\nThe mean gestational age of the neonates who participated in this study was 38.9&#8201;&#177;&#8201;1.6&#8201;weeks. Of the 300 neonates, 166 (55.3%) were male while 134(44.7%) were female with a male/female ratio of 1.2:1. The mean age at the time of recruitment was 6.63&#8201;&#177;&#8201;6.98&#8201;days. Both rectal and tympanic temperatures ranged from 35&#8201;&#176;C to 39.4&#8201;&#176;C. The mean rectal temperature (37.34 &#177;0.55&#8201;&#176;C) was significantly higher than the mean tympanic temperature (37.25 &#177;0.56&#8201;&#176;C;p&#8201;<&#8201;0.001). There was a significant positive correlation between rectal and tympanic temperatures (r&#8201;=&#8201;0.91; p&#8201;<&#8201;0.001).As shown in Figure&#8201;1, high rectal temperatures were associated with high tympanic temperatures.The Bland-Altman plot (Figure&#8201;2) showed that most of the data points were tightly clustered around the zero line of the difference between the two temperature readings with only 8.3% of the readings falling outside the 95% level of confidence. The average difference between the mean of both rectal and tympanic temperatures was 0.09&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.24&#8201;&#176;C (95% CI: 0.06, 0.12).Tympanic temperatures &#8805;37.5&#8201;&#176;C and subsequent 0.1&#8201;&#176;C differences up to 38&#8201;&#176;C were considered as rectal temperatures cut-offs and the comparison with tympanic measurements showed sensitivities of 65% to 86% and specificities of 95% to 99%. The positive predictive values of the tympanic measurements ranged from 82% to 93% while the negative predictive values ranged from 80% to 98% (Table&#8201;1). The Receiver Operating Curves (ROC) showed the highest accuracy at the temperature cut-off of 38&#176;C and Area Under the Curve of 0.91(Figures&#8201;3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8).\nDiscussion\nMonitoring the body temperature of neonates is a clinically necessary procedure to assess the overall patients&#8217; status. There is a need to accurately measure temperature as any alteration could signal the onset of infection, serious reactions to medications, critical loss of heat from exposure and other specific disease conditions. Temperatures get measured at the least as frequently as every three hours in a typical neonatal care unit. Thus, the importance of painless, accurate and rapid measurement of temperature cannot be over-emphasized. Temperature measurements through the rectal route have been considered the gold standard method in children but there is evidence that it is associated with many risks and complications [1-8]. On the other hand, measurement through the tympanic route using the infrared tympanic thermometer has been adjudged to be easier and quicker for assessment of body temperatures [1,9].In this study, we found a strong positive correlation between rectal and tympanic temperatures as earlier reported in other studies in Nigeria [12,17]. The mean rectal temperature taken with the mercury-in-glass thermometer was significantly higher than the mean tympanic temperature taken with the Infrared tympanic thermometer by 0.09&#8201;&#176;C. This agrees with findings reported by Edelu et al.[17] who also used the mercury-in-glass thermometer to measure rectal temperatures. Uslu et al.[19] in their study also reported similar findings even though sick newborns were studied. The reasons postulated for the higher rectal temperatures noted was that the rectum was better insulated than the tympanic membrane from external temperature changes [14].This difference (0.09&#176;C), though apparently small, is significant when measuring temperature in the neonate where accuracy is crucial for important management decisions. Akinyinka et al.[12] also reported a comparable mean difference between rectal and tympanic temperatures of 0.08&#8201;&#176;C but the difference was not statistically significant. The lack of statistical significance in the mean temperature difference in the study by Akinyinka et al.[12] could be attributed to the smaller sample size compared to the present study. In an earlier study, Weiss et al.[16] got a difference of 0.4&#8201;&#176;C between both rectal and tympanic measurements but the electronic thermometer was used to measure rectal temperatures instead of mercury-in-glass thermometer used in our study.In the present study, we used various rectal temperature cut-offs at 0.1&#8201;&#176;C intervals between 37.5&#8201;&#176;C and 38&#8201;&#176;C to compute the sensitivities, specificities and predictive values of tympanic temperature measurements. It was noted that the sensitivities of tympanic temperatures in detecting rectal temperatures at cut-offs greater than or equal to 37.5&#8201;&#176;C were low but increased with higher rectal temperatures (65% -86%). The temperature measurements from the two sites however showed very high specificities ranging from 95% to 99%. These findings suggest that tympanic thermometry for detection of fever in the neonates may not actually be good for screening purposes but has improved diagnostic accuracy as body temperature increases. The increasing sensitivities at higher temperature values was also observed by Edelu et al.[17]. Moreover, the fact that our data showed relatively low sensitivities at lower temperature cut-offs implies that at these temperature cut-offs, about 14-35% of neonates found to be &#8216;febrile&#8217; as defined by any of these rectal cut-offs might be missed if the tympanic thermometer was used. The high specificities however indicated that a neonate adjudged to be hypothermic or pyretic using the rectal route will also be detected as hypothermic or pyretic by the tympanic route.The positive and negative predictive values were also high, ranging from 82% to 93% and 80% to 98% respectively and these values increased with increasing temperatures cut-offs. The Receiver Operating Curves also supported these findings with greater accuracy at higher temperatures than lower ones. This implies that at higher temperature cut-offs, tympanic temperatures are more sensitive and specific and accurate in determining rectal temperatures than at relatively lower ones.A limitation of this study was that we did not have a true measure of core body temperature to compare our temperature findings with. Core temperature refers to the measurement that most closely reflects the temperature in the blood flowing through the branches of the carotid arteries to the hypothalamus [5]. However, since the hypothalamus is inaccessible, other sites of core temperature measurement include the pulmonary artery, oesophagus, nasopharynx and bladder [1]. Since these sites are not routinely used in everyday practice and the patients in our study were apparently healthy neonates, the rectum was used as it has been shown to accurately approximate core temperature [1].\nConclusions\nIt is concluded that though using the tympanic route for measuring temperature in the neonate is relatively safe and non invasive, its low sensitivity limits its use despite the good correlation and agreement between the measurements taken from the two routes. Further studies will be needed to further evaluate its utility in neonates especially in resource poor countries.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors\u2019 contributions\nCOD conceived the study, participated in its design, coordination and acquisition of data and drafting of the manuscript.

Scaling up addiction services in prisons is a global public health and human rights challenge, especially in poorly resourced countries. We systematically reviewed the prevalence of substance use in prison populations in low- and middle-income countries. We searched for studies reporting prevalence rates of nicotine, alcohol, illicit drug, and injection drug use during imprisonment in unselected samples of imprisoned people in low- and middle-income countries. Data meta-analysis was conducted and sources of heterogeneity were examined by meta-regression. Prevalence of nicotine use during imprisonment ranged from 5% to 87%, with a random-effects pooled estimate of 56% (95% confidence interval (CI): 45, 66) with significant geographical heterogeneity. Alcohol use varied from 1% to 76% (pooled prevalence, 16%, 95% CI: 9, 25). Approximately one-quarter of people (25%; 95% CI: 17, 33; range, 0&#8211;78) used illicit drugs during imprisonment. The prevalence of injection drug use varied from 0% to 26% (pooled estimate, 1.6%, 95% CI: 0.8, 3.0). Lifetime substance use was investigated in secondary analyses. The high prevalence of smoking in prison suggests that policies regarding smoking need careful review. Furthermore, the findings underscore the importance of timely, scalable, and available treatments for alcohol and illegal drug use by people involved with the criminal justice system.", "body": "INTRODUCTION\nPrison populations in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) have been increasing over the past few decades (1). The increase has been especially pronounced in the Americas and in Oceania. Since the year 2000, prison populations increased by 60% in Oceania, by 80% in Central America, and by 145% in South America (1, 2). Little is known about major causes of morbidity in people involved with the criminal justice system in LMICs, and prison health services rely on evidence from high-income countries. In such settings, a major health problem is substance use disorders (3, 4). These disorders increase the risk of a range of adverse outcomes, including infectious diseases (5), other mental health problems (6), and death (7, 8), and of reoffending on release (9). Although there is high-quality evidence from the general population and prison populations (10) for treatment, there appear to be substantial unmet treatment needs in people involved with the criminal justice system (11). In Latin America, for example, only 1% to 20% of prisons have been reported to have specialized mental health services (11). Bans and treatments in prisons may have continuing effects after release, in contrast to approaches only focusing on forced abstinence in the controlled prison environment (10, 12).Imprisonment in LMICs is characterized by low budgets that permit providing only basic services, and by overcrowding and human rights violations (11, 13, 14). Human rights concerns have been raised particularly for people with substance use and other psychiatric disorders in prisons (15). In addition to the lack of basic care, there has been little mental health research in prison populations in LMICs (16); such research could assist in providing an evidence base from which to develop services. Based on limited research, it has been suggested that there is a higher prevalence of mental disorders in imprisoned LMIC populations (17); to our knowledge, however, substance use disorders have not been systematically reviewed. This study aims to present a systematic review and meta-analysis of substance use problems in imprisoned people of LMICs while they are in custody and, secondarily, to determine lifetime substance abuse rates.\nMETHODS\nThis systematic review followed the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines (18) and data are reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (19).\nSearch strategy\nA systematic search of the literature was conducted covering the time from 1987, when the distinction betweenanalytical classification of countries in low-, middle-, and high-income economies was introduced by the World Bank as a development indicator (www.worldbank.org), until March 2017. The search included 1) online databases (i.e., CAB Abstracts; Embase; Global Health; MEDLINE; PsycINFO; Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts; Criminal Justice Database; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences; PAIS Index; Social Services Abstracts; LILACS; and Scopus); 2) key journals (e.g., Addiction; Addictive Behaviors), 3) reference lists of identified papers and relevant systematic reviews; and 4) ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global, Open Grey, and correspondence with authors. For the online database searches, we used a combined strategy of free-text strings and subject headings related to substance use, prison settings, and prevalence studies (detailed search terms and strings are shown in Web Appendix 1, available at https://academic.oup.com/aje; the results for each online database are shown in Web Table 1, and those for the grey literature are listed in Web Table 2). Non-English articles were translated.\nInclusion and exclusion criteria\nWe identified studies in which prevalence rates were reported of substance use in the general prison population. The following inclusion criteria were applied: 1) Data were collected from unselected general prison populations; 2) the prevalence rates of the use of nicotine, alcohol, illicit drugs, cannabis, cocaine, opiates, and/or injection drugs were established with questionnaires or as part of a research interview; 3) the sampling was representative for the prison population or the population of a facility; and 4) the study was conducted in an LMIC at the time of data collection.The following exclusion criteria were applied: 1) studies in which a particular age group was selected, such as adolescents or a particular offender type; 2) publications reporting data from the same samples as other publications (the most comprehensive publication was retained); 3) convenience sampling; 4) studies only reporting the prevalence of substance use, applying the disorder criteria (and not the prevalence of substance use without necessarily fulfilling disorder criteria); and 5) studies reporting data collected before 1987 (Web Figure 1).\nData extraction\nTwo reviewers (G.B., C.G.) independently extracted the data from the included studies. The following data were extracted: sex, mean age, year and country of data collection, sample size, nonresponse rate, type of substance use, and number of people with any specific type of substance use. The periods covered by the reported prevalence estimates were extracted and coded as during imprisonment (i.e., point prevalence, including &#8804;1 year) and before imprisonment (including 1 year before imprisonment up to lifetime). When data were missing or clarification was needed, authors of primary studies were contacted. We included people on remand (i.e., in jails, pretrial, and detainees) and sentenced individuals. If the prevalence of heroin use was reported in addition to the prevalence of other opiate use, rates were added to infer the overall prevalence of opiate use. If the prevalence of heroin use was reported as being part of the group of opiate use or vice versa, the higher rate was extracted as the overall prevalence of opiate use. For countries in Europe, Asia, and Africa that did not report opiate use but did report injection drug use, the latter was taken as a proxy for opiate use as well.\nStatistical analysis\nIf publications reported prevalence estimates separately for men and women or for samples from different countries, they were included in the statistical analyses as different samples. As a consequence, the number of samples is higher than the number of studies. Studies in which less than 10% of participants were of 1 sex were considered representative for the other sex. Separate meta-analyses were conducted for the rates before and during imprisonment. To account for high heterogeneity between the samples, we used random-effects models to balance the weighting of studies for data syntheses (20). To allow comparison between random- and fixed-effects models, fixed-effects meta-analyses also were calculated. Wilson&#8217;s method was used to calculate 95% confidence intervals for prevalence estimates (21). Heterogeneity among studies was estimated based on Cochran Q test and reported using the I2 statistic and 95% confidence interval. I2 > 75% indicated high heterogeneity (22).Random-effects meta-regressions were conducted to assess the effects of prespecified sample characteristics on the prevalence of substance use. In additional secondary analyses, we included rates of substance use before imprisonment as variables in the regression analyses when assessing the heterogeneity of substance use during imprisonment. Ratios of pooled random-effects prevalence estimates before and during imprisonment were calculated. Ratios (and 95% confidence intervals) of the prevalence in the prison population to the prevalence of the sex-matched general population were calculated for nicotine use because data from the general population were available for most countries. Statistical analyses were conducted with Stata, version 13 (StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas), using the commands metaprop for meta-analyses, metareg for meta-regressions, and metan for the prevalence ratios.\nRESULTS\nIn 83 studies (n = 94 samples), prevalence rates were reported for substance use by 89,667 individuals who were imprisoned in 32 LMICs within 6 regions as defined by the World Health Organization: Africa, Americas, Eastern Mediterranean, Europe, Southeast Asia, and Western Pacific (Web Figure 2).\nNicotine use\nWe identified 24 samples from 17 LMICs reporting prevalence data on nicotine use during imprisonment (23&#8211;43). The prevalence of nicotine use during imprisonment ranged from 5% in Ethiopia to 87% in Lithuania. The heterogeneity among the studies was very high (I2 = 99%; P < 0.01). The prevalence was 56% (95% confidence interval (CI): 45, 66), according to pooled random-effects models, among people imprisoned in LMICs (Figure 1). Prevalence of nicotine use was higher in the Americas (58%; &#946; = 0.327; P = 0.03) and in Europe (75%; &#946; = 0.483; P = 0.001) as compared with Africa, according to meta-regression (Web Table 3).\nAlcohol use\nAlcohol use during imprisonment was reported in 19 samples from 15 LMICs (23, 24, 29, 30, 32&#8211;34, 40, 41, 44&#8211;51). Prevalence ranged from 1% to 76%; between-study heterogeneity was very high (I2 = 99%; P < 0.01). The random-effects pooled prevalence was 16% (95% CI: 9, 25) (Figure 2). Meta-regression analyses did not show any associations between predetermined study characteristics and alcohol use during imprisonment (Web Table 4).\nIllicit drug use during imprisonment\nThere were 26 samples from 14 LMICs reporting prevalence estimates for any illicit drug use during imprisonment (30, 31, 34, 35, 38, 45, 47&#8211;49, 51&#8211;65). These estimates ranged from 0% for imprisoned women in Lithuania to 78% for male prisoners in Kyrgyzstan (I2 = 99%; P < 0.01) (Figure 3). Random-effects pooled prevalence was 25% (95% CI: 17, 33) (Figure 3). No significant associations between study characteristics were found on meta-regression analysis (Web Table 5).\nCannabis use\nPrevalence estimates of cannabis use during imprisonment were reported for 30 samples in 16 LMICs (23, 24, 27, 31, 32, 34, 40, 41, 43, 44, 46, 47, 50, 51, 53, 56&#8211;58, 60&#8211;66); these varied from 1% to 55% (Web Figure 3), with high heterogeneity (I2 = 99%; P < 0.01). Pooled prevalence on random-effects meta-analysis was 17% (95% CI: 12, 23) for cannabis use during imprisonment in LMICs. In the Americas, cannabis use was more frequent (25%; &#946; = 0.145; P = 0.041) than in Africa (Web Table 6).\nOther drugs\nPrevalence estimates of cocaine use during imprisonment were reported for 20 samples in 8 LMICs (23, 27, 31, 32, 34, 41, 44, 46&#8211;48, 51, 53, 56, 60&#8211;64). Prevalence estimates for cocaine use during imprisonment ranged from 0% to 29% (Web Figure 4). The heterogeneity between the studies was high (I2 = 99.2%; P < 0.001). According to pooled rates, the prevalence of cocaine use during imprisonment in LMICs was 5% (95% CI: 2, 8). On meta-regression, no study characteristics were associated with the prevalence of cocaine use during imprisonment (Web Table 7).Prevalence estimates of opiate use during imprisonment were reported for 26 samples in 14 LMICs (23, 32, 34, 35, 41, 43, 44, 47, 50&#8211;52, 58&#8211;60, 62&#8211;65, 67&#8211;71); these rates varied from 0% to 80% (Web Figure 5), with a pooled prevalence of 6% (95% CI: 3, 11). No associations were found on meta-regression (Web Table 8).\nInjection drug use during imprisonment\nPrevalence estimates for injection drug use during imprisonment were reported for 28 samples from 16 LMICs (27, 32, 35, 41, 45&#8211;48, 52, 54, 57&#8211;59, 64, 68&#8211;76); these rates varied from 0% to 26% (Figure 4). The pooled random-effects prevalence was 1.7% (95% CI: 0.6, 3.1). The rate of injection drug use in European LMICs was higher than in Africa, according to meta-regression analyses (6.5%; &#946; = 0.087; P = 0.027) (Web Table 9).\nOther analyses\nPrevalence rates of substance use before imprisonment are reported in the Web Appendices 2&#8211;8 and in the Web Figures 6&#8211;12 (24&#8211;27, 29, 32&#8211;35, 38, 40&#8211;42, 44&#8211;52, 54, 55, 57&#8211;106). Pooled random-effects estimates were 70% for nicotine use (Web Appendix 2 and Web Figure 6), 71% for alcohol use (Web Appendix 3 and Web Figure 7), 48% for illicit drug use (Web Appendix 4 and Web Figure 8), 37% for cannabis use (Web Appendix 5 and Web Figure 9), 23% for cocaine use (Web Appendix 6 and Web Figure 10), 10% for opiate use (Web Appendix 7 and Web Figure 11), and 10% for injection drug use (Web Appendix 8 and Web Figure 12). There was clear geographical heterogeneity for nicotine use, alcohol use, cocaine use, opiate use, and injection drug use before imprisonment (Web Tables 3&#8211;9). Web Table 10 lists all included studies reporting the prevalence of substance use in prison populations during or before imprisonment.We assessed whether substance use before imprisonment explained part of the heterogeneity of substance use during imprisonment. For nicotine, alcohol, any illicit drug use, and injection drug use, the prevalence before imprisonment was not associated with heterogeneity. However, for cannabis (P < 0.001), cocaine (P < 0.001), and opiate use (P < 0.001), the prevalence before imprisonment was significantly associated with the prevalence during imprisonment, according to univariate analyses (Web Tables 3&#8211;9). According to multivariate meta-regression, sex (&#946; = 0.198; P = 0.050) and imprisonment in Europe (&#946; = 0.236; P = 0.009) retained statistical significance for the prevalence of nicotine use before imprisonment (Web Table 3). Only cannabis use before imprisonment (&#946; = 0.00018; P < 0.001) remained significant for cannabis use during imprisonment (Web Table 6). Regional heterogeneity for cocaine use before imprisonment was supported by multivariate regression analysis, with higher prevalence in the Americas (&#946; = 0.389; P < 0.001) and in Europe (&#946; = 0.104; P = 0.031) (Web Table 7). For the prevalence of opiate use before imprisonment, the prevalence in the Eastern Mediterranean region (&#946; = 0.135; P < 0.046) and the nonresponse rate (&#946; = 0.0022; P = 0.018) were significant in multivariate analyses (Web Table 8). Ratios of pooled random-effects prevalence rates before compared with during imprisonment were 1.3 (95% CI: 1.2, 1.3) for nicotine use; 4.4 (95% CI: 4.3, 4.6) for alcohol use; 2.0 (95% CI: 1.9, 2.0) for any illicit drug use; 2.2 (95% CI: 2.1, 2.3) for cannabis use; 4.9 (95% CI: 4.6, 5.2) for cocaine use; 1.7 (95% CI: 1.6, 1.8) for use of opiates; and 60 (95% CI: 55, 66) for injection drug use. Ratios were consistently higher than 1, indicating higher rates for substance use before than during imprisonment. Fixed-effects models for all analyses are presented in Web Table 11.We estimated prevalence ratios for nicotine use, which were prevalence rates among prison populations compared with sex-matched estimates in the general population from the countries where those prisons were located. For nicotine, prevalence ratios were all higher than 1 and ranged from 1.2 (95% CI: 0.9, 1.7) in Ethiopia to 11.2 (95% CI: 10.4, 12.1) in Mexico (Figure 5).\nDISCUSSION\n\nMain results\nWe have provided estimates of nicotine, alcohol, and illicit drug use during imprisonment from a systematic review and meta-analysis of 94 samples in 83 studies and nearly 90,000 people imprisoned in LMICs. There were 3 main findings. First, the pooled random-effects prevalence of nicotine use during imprisonment was 56%; the prevalence ratios of all the included primary studies were higher than those of the general populations. Second, a pooled prevalence of 16% was calculated for alcohol use during imprisonment, with wide variations in geographical prevalence. Third, it was estimated that approximately one-quarter of the imprisoned people (pooled prevalence, 25%, 95% CI: 17, 33) used illicit drugs during imprisonment, and injection drug use during imprisonment was estimated at 1.7% (95% CI: 0.6, 3.1).\nStrength and limitations\nTo our knowledge, this is the first systematic review of substance use problems in prison populations of LMICs worldwide. We provide a sufficient body of evidence from data synthesis and have conducted meta-regression analyses examining sources of heterogeneity. The pooled prevalence estimates have to be interpreted with caution because of the high between-study heterogeneity of the data, which would be expected, considering the differences in criminal justice systems and prisons around the world. As a consequence, in addition to a random-effects prevalence that assumes heterogeneity, we have provided prevalence ranges and fixed-effects models. The latter weigh studies more by sample size and may be informative when small study effects are considered strong. An additional limitation of this study is the variability of the policy contexts with respect to (partial) smoking bans and the implementation of drug and alcohol bans.\nImplications\nIn contrast to the other substances reviewed here, nicotine use is legal in prisons in LMICs, to our knowledge. A principal implication of this review is the need to review smoking policies inside prisons in LMICs. Policy initiatives in this regard are relatively new in high-income countries, where tobacco control generally has been more effective (107). Several high-income countries have introduced smoking bans in prisons and jails (108&#8211;111), which should reduce morbidity and death among people involved in the criminal justice system (108). Smoking bans during imprisonment combined with psychological interventions before release can be successful in prolonging abstinence from smoking after release (10). In the current meta-analysis, we report more than half of the people imprisoned in LMICs smoked during imprisonment, and thus, the potential for addressing this is considerable. We also have shown that these rates of nicotine use are substantially higher than in the general population of the specific countries of the primary studies included in the review. Therefore, policies to ban smoking in prisons and treatments to reduce nicotine addiction should be considered in LMICs, especially in the Americas and in Europe, where the rates are particularly high.A second implication is the importance of ensuring that alcohol treatments are available in prisons in LMICs. There has been considerable interest in addressing drug use, particularly as it is associated with infectious diseases, but in this review, we found that approximately 1 in 6 imprisoned people consumes alcohol inside prison. Many of these individuals may not have alcohol use disorders, but many do and will continue to on release. Because alcohol is usually banned in prisons and difficult to smuggle, it is often produced inside prisons and, consequently, tends to be of low quality and high toxicity (33, 112). Prison services need to have available appropriate alcohol detoxification treatments on entry and to consider other interventions, including group therapies and other psychosocial treatments that are scalable (113). In addition, the heterogeneity of prevalence estimates for alcohol use during imprisonment indicates the need for local surveys to best inform service development. Such local surveys may not be feasible owing to financial pressures in some countries; therefore, the estimates presented here could be of assistance.A third implication is that the findings underscore the importance of addressing illicit drug use during imprisonment. High-income countries have high rates and persistence of illicit drug use during imprisonment, especially heroin use (114). We found that approximately one-quarter of the prison population uses illicit drugs during imprisonment. There is good evidence for the effectiveness of opioid-substitution treatment in prison populations (115). However, apart from initiatives in a few countries (116), treatment interventions are mostly unavailable in LMICs. In addition, we report important regional differences in the prevalence of cannabis and possibly of opiate and cocaine use. This would suggest that rather than 1 treatment model for all countries, interventions may need to be tailored at regional or national levels for specific types of drug use problems.Injection drug use is a risk factor for spreading HIV in prisons in LMICs (117, 118). There remains a paucity of data available from LMICs (117), with data from 32 countries and considerable heterogeneity in the findings. More research on the changing dynamics of injection drug use in LMICs is required.Individual prevalence rates of specific types of illicit drugs used before imprisonment, including cannabis, opiates, and cocaine, explained part of the heterogeneity in illicit drug use prevalence during imprisonment. We also found that prevalence rates of substance use before imprisonment were consistently higher than those during imprisonment for all substances. This difference was more pronounced for alcohol than for illicit drugs, suggesting that prison systems more effectively limit alcohol than illicit drugs. Overall, this suggests that people import their substance use problems into prison and further underscores the need for intervention programs to be integrated between the community and prison.\nConclusion\nWe report estimates of smoking, alcohol, and illicit drug use during imprisonment in LMICs. Approximately 1 in 2 prisoners smokes, 1 in 6 drinks alcohol, and 1 in 4 uses illicit drugs. From a public health perspective, these high rates represent an opportunity for intervention, particularly because interventions that are effective in other settings can be transferred to prisons. Smoking bans in prisons, and scalable and available detoxification and addiction services have the potential to address the large burdens of smoking and substance use in LMICs.\nSupplementary Material\n", "pmid": "29584860", "title": "Substance Use During Imprisonment in Low- and Middle-Income Countries", "journal_title": "Epidemiologic Reviews", "authors": "Adrian P Mundt;Gerg\u0151 Baranyi;Caroline Gabrysch;Seena Fazel", "doi": "10.1093/epirev/mxx016", "score": "0.009657755"}, {"keywords": "DNA barcodes;species delimitation;subspecies;systematics;taxonomy", "abstract": "Abstract\nWe here propose a new, monotypic genus, Amiga Nakahara, Willmott & Espeland, gen. n., to harbor a common Neotropical butterfly, described as Papilioarnaca Fabricius, 1776, and hitherto placed in the genus Chloreuptychia Forster, 1964. Recent and ongoing molecular phylogenetic research has shown Chloreuptychia to be polyphyletic, with C.arnaca proving to be unrelated to remaining species and not readily placed in any other described genus. Amigaarnacagen. n. et comb. n. as treated here is a widely distributed and very common species ranging from southern Mexico to southern Brazil.

Many new satyrine taxa have recently been discovered and described, including some that are among the most common elements of the butterfly fauna around us (e.g., Cong and Grishin 2014; Freitas et al. 2016).Chloreuptychia Forster, 1964 is a genus in the Satyrinae subtribe Euptychiina, currently (Lamas 2004) containing some of the most brightly coloured euptychiine species, which possess a bluish-lilac reflection on their wings. Butler (1867) made one of the first attempts to classify those species later placed in Chloreuptychia by Forster (1964) in a systematic context. The &#8220;Division IV&#8221; proposed by Butler (1867) was distinguished from other closely related species by &#8220;Wings dorsally fuscous, mostly with a violet sheen; ventrally with ocellated spots, those of the hindwings often with their centers elongated and silver&#8221;, and he further separated this &#8220;Division IV&#8221; into two subdivisions. The &#8220;subdivision 1&#8221; was characterized by &#8220;Wings ventrally with regular-shaped ocelli, not elongated&#8221; and included Euptychiasericeella Bates, 1865 and Papilioebusa Cramer, 1780, &#8220;subdivision 2&#8221; was characterized by &#8220;Hindwings ventrally with ocelli centered with irregular and elongated spots&#8221; and included P.chloris Cramer, 1780, P.herse Cramer, 1775, E.callichloris Butler, 1867, E.hewitsonii Butler, 1867, E.agatha Butler, 1867, and E.tolumnia Cramer, 1777. Both subdivisions also contained some species currently (Lamas 2004) not placed in Chloreuptychia. Subsequently, Butler (1877) grouped species related to species currently placed in Chloreuptychia under his &#8220;arnaea [sic] group&#8221;, although without providing a diagnosis, including Euptychiaarnaea [sic] Fabricius, 1776, E.sericeella, E.chloris, E.herse, E.callichloris, E.hewitsonii, E.agatha, and E.tolumnia, in addition to three unrelated species. Unlike in Butler (1867), Euptychiaarnaea [sic] and E.sericeella were apparently considered as conspecific in Butler (1877). Weymer (1911) recognized E.arnaea [sic], E.sericella [sic], E.chloris, E.marica Weymer, 1911, E.herse, and E.callichloris in his &#8220;Arnaea [sic] group&#8221;, and E.tolumnia, E.catharina Staudinger, [1886], and E.hewitsonii in his &#8220;Tolumnia group&#8221;, in which the latter group was characterized by the presence of forewing androconial scales (scent-scales) in males. Forster (1964) erected the genus Chloreuptychia by designating P.chloris as the type species of the genus, and recognized E.arnaea [sic], E.sericella [sic], P.chloris, E.herse, E.marica, E.catharina, E.tolumnia, and E.hewitsonii in his new genus. This classification was followed by Miller (1968). Lamas (2004) recognized 10 species in Chloreuptychia, namely C.agatha, C.arnaca, C.callichloris, C.catharina, C.chlorimene (H&#252;bner, [1819]), C.herseis (Godart, [1824]), C.hewitsonii, C.marica, C.sericeella, and C.tolumnia, in addition to two undescribed species from Peru. Importantly, Lamas (2004) listed replacement names provided by subsequent authors for the preoccupied names P.herse and P.chloris, namely C.herseis and P.chlorimene respectively, both of which were ignored in earlier studies. Recently, C.amethysta Br&#233;vignon & Benmesbah, 2012 was described as a new species, bringing the total number of described species for this genus to eleven (Lamas 2004; Br&#233;vignon and Benmesbah 2012).Previous authors apparently placed species in Chloreuptychia based mainly on the bluish-lilac reflection on the wing surface, without testing monophyly and/or synapomorphies, and the genus has proved to be highly polyphyletic based on recent broad collaborative research on the group (Espeland et al. 2019; unpubl. data). In order to contribute towards a better understanding of the Euptychiina systematics, we here describe a new genus to harbor P.arnaca, and review the taxonomy of this common component of the butterfly community in the Neotropics. Neotypes for the names P.arnaca and P.ebusa are designated, and two new subspecies are described based on wing pattern and DNA data.\nMaterial and methods\n\nMorphological study\nWe studied external morphology by soaking legs, labial palpi, and abdomens in hot 10% KOH solution for 5&#8211;10 minutes and dissecting them, storing them in glycerine after examination. Membranous structures of the phallus and female genitalia were stained with chlorazol black prior to examination to better visualize membranous structures. Drawings of external morphology were done using a camera lucida attached to a Leica MZ 16 stereomicroscope at FLMNH. Terminology for wing venation and wing pattern elements follows Nakahara et al. (2018b); nomenclature of genitalia follows Nakahara et al. (2018a).The following collection acronyms are used throughout the text:BME Bohart Museum of Entomology, University of California, Davis, CA, USACBF Colecci&#243;n Boliviana de Fauna, La Paz, BoliviaCMNH Carnegie Museum of Natural History, Pittsburgh, USADZUP Departamento de Zoologia, Universidade Federal do Paran&#225;, Curitiba, BrazilFLMNH McGuire Center for Lepidoptera and Biodiversity, Florida Museum of Natural History, University of Florida, Gainesville, USAFRPI Francisco Pi&#241;as collection, Quito, EcuadorHERENCIA Corporaci&#243;n Herencia Natural y Cultural collection, Florencia, ColombiaICNA Ichiro Nakamura collection, Williamsville, USAINABIO Instituto Nacional de Biodiversidad, Ecuador (formerly MECN)LBCB L. & C.

Voucher specimens are deposited at FLMNH, DZUP and ZUEC.DNA extraction methods, PCR conditions and primers used for amplification of cytochrome c oxidase I (COI), elongation factor 1-alpha (EF1-a), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and ribosomal protein S5 (RPS5) follow Nakahara et al. (2015, 2018a, 2018b). Sequences for additional specimens were taken from Pe&#241;a et al. (2010), Matos-Marav&#237; et al. (2013) and Espeland et al. (2019) (Table 1). The complete concatenated Sanger dataset contained 19 taxa, including eight A.arnaca specimens, and 2934bps. As it has previously been shown that using the standard genes above might not provide sufficient support for the deeper relationships of Euptychiina (Pe&#241;a et al. 2010), we also inferred a phylogeny using the 368 loci (182, 350bps) for 17 of the taxa analyzed by Espeland et al. (2019). This dataset contains single specimens of Amiga gen. n., Chloreuptychiachlorimene, C.herseis, and C.catharina as well as outgroups to better show the placement of arnaca relative to other members of Chloreuptychia. These are available on Mendeley Data (https://doi.org/10.17632/m7gc59vnp3.1).Sequences generated by Sanger sequencing were assembled using Geneious 10 (Biomatters), and aligned using MAFFT v. 7 (Katoh 2013). Phylogenies were inferred for each gene separately (Sanger data only) as well for the concatenated data. The genes were partitioned to codon position and partitions and models were selected using ModelFinder (Kalyaanamoorthy et al. 2017) in IQ-Tree 1.6.7 (Nguyen et al. 2015). Thereafter 200 tree searches were performed in IQ-tree and the tree with the highest likelihood was selected. Support was calculated based on 2000 ultrafast bootstrap replicates with the -bnni option to reduce the risk of overestimating branch support (Hoang et al. 2017). The trees were rooted with Cyllopsishedemanni R. Felder, 1869 based on prior information (Espeland et al. 2019). The hybrid enrichment data were cleaned, assembled and aligned according to Espeland et al. (2018, 2019). A phylogeny was inferred using IQ-tree as above, but with 1000 ultrafast bootstrap replicates, also rooting with Cyllopsishedemanni. All nodes with a support lower than 75 were collapsed and this tree was subsequently used as a constraint tree for the concatenated Sanger data, which was analyzed in IQ-Tree as above, leading to the final dataset containing 31 taxa. GenBank accession numbers for sequences used in this study can be found in Table 1.For species delimitation, a dataset consisting only of COI sequences with unique haplotypes was used. Sequences were aligned as above. The alignment was shortened to minimize the amount of missing data at both ends and the final dataset consisted of 30 sequences with a length of 615 bps. This included 16 Amigaarnaca comb. n. specimens and multiple outgroups. Sequences were not available for one of the proposed taxa (A.arnacaindianacristoi ssp. n.). Single threshold GMYC (Generalized Mixed Yule Coalescent; Pons et al. 2006; Fujisawa and Barraclough 2013), bPTP (bayesian Poisson Tree Processes; Zhang et al. 2013) and ABGD (Automated Barcode Gap Discovery; Puillandre et al. 2012) were used to assess the threshold between infra- and interspecific relationships in A.arnaca comb. n. GMYC assigns branching events to either a yule process (interspecific) or the coalescent (intraspecific). The reduced COI dataset was partitioned into codon positions, and model selection and phylogenetic inference was done as above. The resulting tree was rendered ultrametric using semi-parametric penalized likelihood (Sanderson 2002) by applying the chronos function in the APE package (Paradis et al. 2004, Popescu et al. 2012) in R. The fit of four clock models (strict clock, discrete clock with 10 rate categories, correlated clock and relaxed clock) was tested using the &#934; information criterion by Paradis (2013). For all four clock models three different values (0.01, 0.1, 1) of the smoothing parameter (lambda) were tested. A strict clock model was found to be the best fit and the smoothing parameter did not affect the species delimitation result, so only GMYC results for the strict clock tree with lambda = 1 are shown below. Support values of species clusters delimited by GMYC were calculated using information-theoretic multimodel inference (Fujisawa and Barraclough 2013). GMYC was performed using the SPLITS package v. 1.0-19 (from http://r-forge.r-project. org/projects/splits) in R. bPTP models branching events were based on the number of substitutions (Zhang et al. 2013), and consequently do not require an ultrametric input tree. We used the ML tree inferred above as input for bPTP analyses on the bPTP webserver (https://species.h-its.org/ptp/). The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) was run for a total of 500,000 generations with thinning set to 1000 and burnin to 0.1. ABGD tries to find a barcode gap in the distribution of pair wise differences (Puillandre et al. 2012) and does not require an input tree. The reduced COI alignment was used as input for ABGD analyses on the ABGD webserver (http://wwwabi.snv.jussieu.fr/public/abgd/abgdweb.html) using the Kimura distance with transition/transvertion ratio set to 2. Pmin, Pmax, Steps and Nb bins were kept as default, and the relative gap width (X) was set to 1. The genetic distances were calculated based on the Tamura-Nei model using Geneious version 11.1.5 (Biomatters Ltd.) based on COI data (Table 2).\nResults and discussion\n\nMolecular phylogeny and species delimitation\nThe ML tree based on four genes and with the 368 gene hybrid enrichment tree used as a constraint tree is shown in Figure 1A. Although deeper relationships are mostly not well supported it is clear that C.arnaca is not closely related to the remaining Chloreuptychia species, as also found by Espeland et al. (2019) based on 368 loci, as well as phylogeny inferred based on hybrid enrichment data generated for this study (see Suppl. material 1).All three species delimitation methods delimited the same three &#8220;species&#8221; within Amiga gen. n., with allopatric distributions: eastern Central America to western Ecuador (A.arnacaadela ssp. n.), east of the Andes (A.arnacaarnaca comb. n.), and Mexico to Honduras (A.arnacasericeella comb. n. et stat. n.), although support values are not very high (Fig. 1B). We here decide to consider these taxa as subspecies since A.arnaca comb. n. is a morphologically very distinct species itself, and although morphological differences exist between the subspecies they are not very prominent in comparison with other groups of sympatric, closely related euptychiine species. This taxonomic arrangement is reinforced by three subspecies being recovered only in the gene tree inferred using COI and one nuclear gene (GAPDH), but not in any of the trees inferred using EF1a, RPS5 or in the combined tree (Fig. 1A, B; Suppl. material 1). Because nuclear genes evolve slowly and lineage sorting is slower compared to mitochondrial genes, we consider these data to provide evidence for the subspecific status of the taxa discussed below. Braby et al. (2012) defined subspecies in butterflies as partially isolated, allopatric, lineages within a species that are phenotypically distinguishable with at least one fixed diagnosable character state correlated with genetic structure, which matches exactly what we find here. In addition to the three subspecies delimited above we consider another allopatric lineage (A.arnacaindianacristoi ssp. n.) as a subspecies based on morphological differences only, as we could not obtain sequence data from this particular taxon.\nNone\nNakahara, Willmott & Espeland\ngen. n.http://zoobank.org/ADBD4E75-4ACB-4C53-93D6-D557DA94CB4B\nType species.\nPapilioarnaca Fabricius, 1776, by present designation\nSystematic placement and diagnosis.\nEspeland et al. (2019) recovered Amigaarnaca comb. n. as sister to the &#8220;Pareuptychia clade&#8221;, whose composition partially corresponded to that found in Pe&#241;a et al. (2010), with a high support (BS and PP > 0.95). The &#8220;Pareuptychia clade&#8221; itself was also well supported (BS and PP > 0.95), including Satyrotaygetissatyrina (Bates, 1865), Magneuptychiainani (Staudinger, [1886]), Euptychoidesalbofasciata (Hewitson, 1869), Neonymphaareolatus (Smith, 1797), Erichthodesantonina (C. Felder & R. Felder, 1867), Pareuptychiaocirrhoe (Fabricius, 1776), Megeuptychiaantonoe (Cramer, 1775), Splendeuptychiadoxes (Godart, [1824]), Nhambikuaramima (Butler, 1867), and Euptychoideseugenia (C. Felder & R. Felder, 1867). Amiga gen. n. is distinguished from all members of the &#8220;Pareuptychia clade&#8221; by the presence of bluish-lilac coloration on the dorsal hindwing and by the purplish sheen in the tornal half of the VHW. Furthermore, the absence of cornuti and membranous lamella antevaginalis of Amiga gen. n. appear to be unusual character states among the clade. The type species of Chloreuptychia, Papiliochloris Cramer, 1780 (= Chloreuptychiachlorimene) was recovered as sister to a moderately supported (BS and PP > 0. 75 < 0. 95), clade including the &#8220;Pareuptychia clade&#8221;, &#8220;Taygetis clade&#8221;, &#8220;Splendeuptychia clade&#8221; and &#8220;Archeuptychia clade&#8221;.\nDescription.\nMALE: Forewing length: 18.5&#8211;22 mm (n = 6)Head: Eyes with sparse golden hair-like setae, with white scales along margin; frons dark brownish, covered with creamy brownish scales and hair-like scales towards antennae;

A broad, faint, iridescent bluish-lilac reflection between the ventral forewing postdiscal band and the umbra is present in specimens from the eastern Andes, whereas it is absent in many specimens from west of the Andes. The absence of this bluish-lilac reflection on the ventral forewing seems rather stable in specimens from western Colombia and western Ecuador. However, this character appears in a few specimens from Panama, and is present in some specimens from Costa Rica and Nicaragua, although the degree of reflection is variable. The bluish-lilac reflection seen mainly on both the dorsal forewing and hindwing is variable in color, varying from light blue to purple. Especially in female specimens, the extent of bluish-lilac reflection on the dorsal forewing is variable, being absent in some specimens, whereas covering most of the discal cell and cells Cu1 and Cu2 in others (see below for further information). There exists a feeble pearly reflection on the ventral forewing from the base to the postdiscal band in specimens from southeastern Brazil (see below for further information), although this is absent in a few specimens. The presence or absence of a ventral forewing ocellus in cell M3 is variable, appearing as a trace in some specimens. The size of the ventral hindwing ocellus in cell M1 is variable in comparison with the ventral hindwing ocellus in cell Cu1, ranging from similar in size to almost twice as large. The genitalia appear not to be informative in separating specimens from east and west of the Andes, although specimens from Central America, including A.arnacasericeella comb. n. et stat. n., seem to have a rather curved dorsal margin of the uncus in lateral view (Fig. 4e).\nEtymology.\nThe new generic name is derived from the feminine Spanish noun &#8220;amiga&#8221;, meaning &#8220;a (female) friend&#8221;, alluding to the fact that this is a common, familiar butterfly. The generic name is regarded as feminine.\nBiology.\nJanzen and Hallwachs (2018) report four grass species (Poaceae), Ichnanthusnemorosus, Ichnanthuspallens, Lasiacisruscifolia, and Paspalumdecumbens, as hostplants for Amiga gen. n. in Costa Rica. In addition, DeVries (1987) reported three grass genera, namely Eleusine, Ichnanthus, and Oplismenus, as hostplants in Costa Rica. Singer and Ehrlich (1993) reported Ichnanthuspallens as a hostplant in Trinidad and Tobago. The egg, mature larva, and pupa of Amiga gen. n. were described and the latter two stages illustrated in DeVries (1987). Various images of the penultimate instar, ultimate instar, prepupa and pupa are figured by Janzen and Hallwachs (2018), based on material reared in Costa Rica. In Costa Rica, adult females of Amiga gen. n. were seen ovipositing late in the afternoon, and some eggs were observed to be parasitized by trichogrammatid wasps (DeVries 1987). The species occurs from sea level to at least 1850 m, and it is common, indeed ubiquitous, in undisturbed to heavily disturbed rain and cloud forest. Both sexes fly low (0.5 m) along shady trails throughout the middle of the day (09:00&#8211;15:00), and males are often observed perching singly on tops of leaves, maintaining apparent territories, and patrolling for ca 10 m along a trail.\nDistribution\n(Fig. 6). This genus ranges from southern Mexico throughout virtually all of tropical Central and South America, where its southernmost distribution appears to be southern Brazil.\nTaxonomy\nAmiga gen. n. is regarded as monotypic, with total of four subspecies recognized, of which two are named and described herein.Amiga Nakahara, Willmott & Espeland, gen. n.(&#8211; denotes a subspecies, &#8211; &#8211; denotes a synonym)arnaca (Fabricius, 1776) comb. n.&#8211; &#8211;ebusa (Cramer, 1780)&#8211; &#8211;priamis (D&#8217;Almeida, 1922)&#8211;adela Nakahara & Espeland, ssp. n.&#8211;sericeella (Bates, 1865) comb. n. et stat. n.&#8211;indianacristoi Nakahara & Mar&#237;n, ssp. n.\nNone\n(Fabricius, 1776)\ncomb. n.Figs 2a&#8211;h\n, 3\n, 4a&#8211;d\n, 4f&#8211;k\n, 5\n, 6\n\nIdentification and taxonomy.\nPapilioarnaca Fabricius, 1776 was described based on an unspecified number of specimens from Suriname, in Johann Dominicus Schulze's collection (Fabricius 1776). Fabricius' description was not accompanied by any illustration of this species, and he did not specify either the sex nor the number of specimens he examined. However, his Latin description is somewhat precise and the identity of the species may be guessed from the description, given the mention of the following wing pattern characters: &#8220;forewing, towards the apex there are three ocelli: the distalmost (\"exteriori\") bi-pupilled&#8221;; &#8220;hindwings bluish; under surface with five ocelli&#8221;; &#8220;Hindwings bluish above, iridescent; below bluish with two oblique dark stripes. Submargin with five ocelli, the first and fourth the largest and black, the remainder dark&#8221;. The mention of multiple ocelli on the (ventral) forewing excludes the possibility of this specimen being other &#8220;Chloreuptychia&#8221; species, which also possess bluish iridescent coloration, but have only a single ocellus on the ventral forewing. Fabricius (1793) considered P.lea Cramer, 1777 and P.arnaca as probably being conspecific, and these two names were associated by some subsequent authors (e.g., Godman and Salvin 1880&#8211;1881), although the mention of five ventral hindwing ocelli for P.arnaca is inconsistent with the six ocelli on the ventral hindwing of P.lea. On the other hand, Neonymphairis C. Felder & R. Felder, 1867 and Euptychiatricolor Hewitson, 1850, two species now placed in Magneuptychia Forster, 1964, also match the aforementioned wing pattern characters provided in Fabricius&#8217; original description. These two species do occur in Suriname, and based on the description provided for P.arnaca, it is difficult to exclude the possibility of Fabricius having examined one of these two species. Regardless of this fact, the name arnaca has been applied in numerous publications and collections to the species as it is identified here (e.g., Whittaker 1983). Considering this situation, stabilizing the nomenclature as currently perceived by many others is crucial regarding the specific epithet arnaca and a neotype is therefore designated for this name below.A worn specimen (whose sex cannot be confidently determined) in William Hunter&#8217;s entomological collection is at the UMG, and it was photographed by GL as a potential type specimen of P.arnaca (see Warren et al. 2018). GL assumed that William Hunter may have received a \"duplicate\" from Schulze through Fabricius, who did indeed supply Hunter with duplicates, resulting in many Fabrician type specimens being found in Hunter&#8217;s insect collection (Hancock 2015; Tuxen 1967). However, we have found no evidence to support that this specimen was originally in Johann Dominicus Schulze's collection, and the Surinamese provenance of the specimen is questionable given its rather narrow ventral bands, which are typical of A.arnacaindianacristoi ssp. n. rather than of specimens from Suriname. The specimen in Glasgow is missing its head and abdomen, in addition to having worn and faded wings, thus somewhat obscuring its true identity. Given this situation, combined with the fact that no authentic Schulze specimens appear to be in existence (e.g., Benmesbah et al. 2018), in addition to the explanation above, we therefore designate a male specimen from Suriname (type locality) as a neotype for P.arnaca following Article 75.3 of the ICZN (1999) (neotype designation): //Suriname Brokopondo Brownsberg, rainforest km 6-12, 30.1.1982, Olle Pellmyr // USNMENT 00913953// (USNM). (Fig. 2a).After introducing this species to science, the specific epithet was misspelled as &#8220;Arnaea&#8221; by Fabricius himself in 1781 and 1787, and as &#8220;Aranea&#8221; in 1793. Subsequently, the specific epithet arnaca has been erroneously spelled in various ways in a disturbingly high number of publications (e.g., Butler and Druce 1874; Butler 1877; Godman and Salvin 1881; Sharpe 1890; Kaye 1904; Weymer 1911; D&#8217;Almeida 1922; Gaede 1931; Forster 1964; Brown 1975; Whittaker 1983; DeVries 1987; see also above), including some influential works on the classification of this group. This confusion surrounding its species-group name adds a special urgency for a neotype designation for this common butterfly.Papilioebusa Cramer, 1780 was described in Pieter Cramer&#8217;s De uitlandsche Kapellen voorkomende in de drie Waereld-Deelen Asia, Africa en America. The original description describes the bluish-lilac reflection on both wing surfaces, although no further description of any wing element was provided in Cramer&#8217;s Dutch and French description. Instead, Cramer compared P.ebusa to P.junia Cramer, 1780, an immediately preceding species described and named in Cramer (1780), but regarded as a junior subjective synonym of P.lea Cramer, 1777 by Lamas (2004). Evidently, P.ebusa and P.junia are not conspecific judging from the illustrations in Cramer (1780: 9; pl. CCXCII: figs D&#8211;G), and the illustrations of P.ebusa combined with Cramer&#8217;s description enable this taxon to be confidently identified. Papiliochloris Cramer, 1780 (now known as Chloreuptychiachlorimene (H&#252;bner, [1819])), is perhaps the only taxon known from Suriname which might have resulted in a similar illustration; however, the illustration of P.chloris provided by Cramer (1780: CCXCIII: figs A, B) excludes this possibility. Based on the Dutch and French description provided for P.ebusa, Cramer based his illustration on what he thought was a female specimen, although the illustration of the dorsal surface (Fig. F) showing the bluish-lilac reflection only on the hindwing indicates that this illustrated specimen is likely to be a male (but see also above for further information). In addition, whether the original description was based on a single specimen or several specimens cannot be unambiguously determined. During our attempt to locate syntype(s) of P.ebusa, two specimens with rounded labels indicating &#8220;[Johan] Calkoen&#8221; with the locality &#8220;Brasilia&#8221; were found in RMNH. Along with the collection of Joan Raye Heer van Breukelerwaard, Johan Calkoen&#8217;s collection includes Cramer types, although given the locality &#8220;Brasilia&#8221;, these two specimens are most likely not syntypes of P.ebusa. Considering that we were unable to find any additional possible syntype(s) of P.ebusa, we here designate a neotype for this name. Although treated as a valid species in the past (e.g., Butler 1867; Godman and Salvin 1880&#8211;1881), in order to maintain its status as a junior synonym of P.arnaca, first recognized by Kirby (1871) and followed by most subsequent authors (e.g., Weymer 1911; Gaede 1931; Lamas 2004), we designate the specimen designated as the neotype of P.arnaca as the neotype of P.ebusa as well and retain its synonymy as a junior objective synonym (neotype designation).D&#8217;Almeida (1922) described Euptychiaarnaea [sic] formpriamis based on a single male from Tr&#234;s Rios, Jacarepagu&#225;, Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, currently housed at the DZUP. Following Article 73.1.2. of the ICZN (1999), we consider this male specimen to be the holotype fixed by monotypy based on the statement of &#8220;one male collected at the type locality&#8221; provided in the original description (D&#8217;Almeida 1922). Lamas (2004) regarded this taxon as a junior subjective synonym of Papilioarnaca without providing any justification. D&#8217;Almeida&#8217;s (1922) original description provides some wing pattern characters which he considered to separate f.priamis, namely &#8220;Underside, feeble pearly reflections extending from the base to the line of ocelli&#8221;; &#8220;Underside, the two rays in the middle are narrow&#8221;. These two wing pattern characters are seen in the holotype male, and indeed, the overall phenotype of specimens from the Brazilian states of Minas Gerais, Esp&#237;rito Santo, and Rio de Janeiro does look somewhat different compared to the neighbouring nominotypical subspecies. Although the feeble pearly reflection extending from the base of the ventral forewing is not seen in the nominotypical subspecies, a few specimens from the aforementioned states in southeastern Brazil appear to lack this reflection (e.g., FLMNH-MGCL-1036218). The narrow ventral bands of many specimens from southeastern Brazil resemble those of A.arnacaindianacristoi ssp. n., although the ventral bands are slightly variable in width and a few specimens (e.g., FLMNH-MGCL-262982, 263014) possess bands that are similar in width to the nominotypical subspecies. Thus, the majority of the specimens from Minas Gerais, Esp&#237;rito Santo, and Rio de Janeiro are distinguishable from the nominotypical subspecies based on the aforementioned characters except for specimens from Bahia consistently possessing wider ventral bands and/or lacking the feeble pearly reflections on the ventral surface. Nevertheless, we decided not to treat A.arnaca from Minas Gerais, Esp&#237;rito Santo, and Rio de Janeiro as a distinct subspecies because, based on molecular data, this taxonomy would result in the nominotypical subspecies being paraphyletic. Whether subspecies should simply represent geographical variation or should also represent an evolutionary unit (i.e. a monophyletic group) is not a focus of this study and this question merits further in-depth discussion and more data. To be consistent in terms of the subspecies concept used in this study, we consider that subspecies should ideally represent clades, unless there is a strong counter-argument, and thus retain the synonymy introduced in Lamas (2004).\nDistribution\n(Fig. 6). The nominotypical subspecies occurs from eastern Colombia south to Bolivia, and in Brazil, southern Venezuela and the Guianas, where it is typically common and widespread in lowland to submontane forest.\nExamined specimens\n(718 &#9794;, 207 &#9792;).

This species-group name is treated as a Latinized feminine adjective in accordance with the feminine generic name.\nDistribution\n(Fig. 6). This subspecies occurs from Nicaragua to western Ecuador.\nNone\n(Bates, 1865), comb. n. et\nstat. n.Figs 2m, n\n, 6\n\nIdentification and taxonomy.\nBates (1865) described Euptychiasericeella based on an unspecified number of &#8220;male&#8221; specimen(s) from Vera Paz, Guatemala. Nevertheless, the only syntype specimen that we have located, in the NHMUK, is a female, a fact also noted by Godman and Salvin (1880: 89&#8211;90), who had this specimen in their possession and referred to it as &#8220;our specimen, marked as the type&#8221;. This specimen (B.M. TYPE No. Rh 3181) was also referred to as a type by Riley and Gabriel (1924: 53) and D&#8217;Abrera (1988: 770&#8211;771). Because of the complexity of euptychiine taxonomy, to provide an unambiguous reference for this name we here designate this specimen as the lectotype of Euptychiasericeella (lectotype designation). Bates explicitly stated that the taxon was closely allied to Eu[ptychia]. ebusa (= Amigaarnacaarnaca comb. n.), indicating that he clearly regarded Euptychiasericeella and Amigaarnacaarnaca as two different species. Despite the ambiguous diagnosis provided in the original description (&#8220;the fore-wing having a narrow costal border, the apex, and a broader outer border of a brown hue&#8221;), the lectotype, figured in Warren et al. (2018), exhibits several rather distinctive phenotypic differences compared to specimens from South America and Nicaragua to western Ecuador. Presumably due to these wing pattern differences, described further below, subsequent authors treated E.sericeella as a species-level taxon (e.g., Butler 1867, 1877; Weymer 1911; Gaede 1931; Forster 1964; Lamas 2004). Specimens from Zelaya department, Nicaragua (e.g., FLMNH-MGCL-263066, 263067, 263072) are phenotypically similar to specimens known from Costa Rica to western Ecuador, and A.a.sericeella thus seems to replace A.a.adela n. ssp. with little or no obvious gap or dispersal barrier separating these taxa, and conversely with no known area of sympatry. Furthermore, the presence of an iridescent bluish-lilac reflection between the postdiscal band and umbra in some specimens of the subspecies from Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama might be a result of introgression with A.a.sericeella. Finally, divergence in the DNA barcode between a specimen from Honduras (LEP-16997) phenotypically similar to the lectotype of sericeella and other Central American A.arnaca from further south is no greater than between east and west Andean A.arnaca (Table 2). Based on these considerations, we downgrade E.sericeella to subspecific rank, proposing, for the first time, what we believe to be the most parsimonious hypothesis of a single species. This null hypothesis remains to be more strongly tested when new evidence, such as distributional, behavioral, or genetic data, becomes available.Both sexes of A.arnacasericeella comb. n. et stat. n. differ from the nominotypical subspecies in the following respects: DHW feeble pearly reflection restricted to posterior one-third of hindwing and not extending into discal cell; ventral ground color somewhat paler; discal band, postdiscal band, submarginal band on the ventral forewing and ventral hindwing narrower; ventral hindwing postdiscal band not bent inwards in cell Cu2 and gently curving towards inner margin (but see also below); ventral ocelli smaller (but see also below); bluish-lilac reflection on ventral surface appearing purplish.\nVariation.\nThe ventral ocelli are variable in terms of size; while many specimens seem to possess ventral ocelli smaller than the nominotypical subspecies and A.arnacaindianacristoi ssp. n., some appear to have ocelli that are similar to the aforementioned two taxa in terms of size. The VHW postdiscal band is bent inwards in cell Cu2 in some specimens, whereas it gradually curves towards the inner margin in other specimens.\nDistribution\n(Fig. 6).

Weakness and loss of dexterity\nappear at an early stage followed by various degrees of muscle overactivities. Spasticity or\nspastic hypertonia elicited by passive stretch of a muscle at rest can interfere with active\nor passive movement1). Hyperexcitability of\nspinal reflexes causes spasticity and spastic hypertonia, but it is not the only mechanism\nthat contributes to spasticity after brain injury. Recent studies indicate that abnormal\nstretch reflex activity is insufficient to explain increased muscle tone2,3,4). Increased stiffness of a muscle during\nstretching due to changes in collagen tissue and tendons, enhancement of the intrinsic\nstiffness of muscle fibers, and loss of sarcomeres can lead to subclinical contractures5).Each of the therapeutic interventions to reduce spasticity including physical therapy,\noccupational therapy, orthoses, pharmacological treatment, chemodenervation, orthopedic\nsurgery, and neurosurgery has different indications and advantages6). There is currently a lack of specific guidelines for the\nstratification and individualization of therapeutic interventions.Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) was first applied to patients in 1980 to break up\nkidney stones7), and later it was\nsuccessfully employed for many orthopedic diseases such as nonunion of long bone\nfracture8), plantar fasciitis9, 10),\ncalcifying tendinitis of the shoulder11, 12), and several inflammatory tendon\ndiseases13); myofascial pain\nsyndrome14, 15); and treatment of spasticity. The mechanisms of how ESWT induces\nthe healing process in human tissue remain uncertain, but recent studies suggest that ESWT\nappears to involve a cascade of interaction between physical shock wave energy and biologic\nresponses including the expression of angiogenesis-related growth factors such as eNOS\n(endothelial nitric oxide synthase), VEGF (vessel endothelial growth factor), and PCNA\n(proliferating cell nuclear antigen) and neovascularization16,17,18,19). The indications for ESWT\nin orthopedic disorders continue to expand13).Recently, clinical trials have been performed to evaluate the efficacy of ESWT.

First, we searched PubMed and TCL records using the following criteria: ((Muscle OR\nMuscular) AND (Spastic* OR Hypertonia* OR Hypertonicit*)) OR (Muscle Tone Increased OR\nSpasticity) AND (Shock Wave* OR ESWT). Second, we searched Embase using the following\ncriteria: (muscle hypertonia&#8217;/exp OR (muscle OR muscular AND (spastic* OR hypertonia* OR\nrigidit*)) OR (muscle AND tone AND increased) OR spastic*) AND (shock wave&#8217;/exp OR shock\nwave* OR &#8216;ESWT&#8217;). Third, we searched Scopus using the following criteria: ((muscle OR\nmuscular) AND (spastic* OR hypertonia* OR rigidit*)) AND (shock wave* OR &#8220;ESWT&#8221;).\nSeventy-three studies were retrieved. Two reviewers working independently screened all the\nabstracts and the titles for the candidate studies and discarded the studies in which\nextracorporeal shock waves were used for different purposes other than spasticity. After the\ninitial screening, they reviewed the full text publications for eligibility, and\ndisagreements between the two reviewers were resolved by consensus. Only studies written in\nEnglish were selected.All of the studies using ESWT for the purpose of ameliorating spasticity in patients with\nany brain injury were included. The studies involving other concomitant interventional\nprocedures, such as botulinum toxin injection, were excluded. We included the studies that\nprovided both baseline and postprocedure Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) grades for selected\nmuscles. The MAS grade was assessed immediately after application of ESWT in all included\nstudies. Among them, four studies suggested MAS grade which was assessed 4 weeks after\napplication of ESWT. The MAS grade ranged from 0 to 4, with 0 indicating no increase in\nmuscle tone and 4 indicating rigid in flexion and extension.From the selected studies, we abstracted data regarding follow-up durations, pre- and\npostprocedure MAS grades, and MAS grades at four weeks after ESWT, and compared them between\ntime intervals.MAS grades were statistically analyzed. Mean &#177; standard deviation values for pre- and\npostprocedure MAS grades and for the MAS grades at four weeks after ESWT were provided in\nall studies. Heterogeneity refers to the differences between studies in terms of\nmethodological factors, such as use of blinding and concealment of allocation. Significant\nstatistical heterogeneity arising from methodological diversity or differences in outcome\nassessments suggests that the studies are not all estimating the same quantity but does not\nnecessarily suggest that the true intervention effect varies. A number of options are\navailable if statistical heterogeneity is identified among a group of studies that would\notherwise be considered suitable for a meta-analysis20). Heterogeneity was calculated by the Cochrane Q statistic test and\nthe I2 test21). The I2 test describes the rate of\nvariation across studies due to heterogeneity rather than chance and ranges from 0 (no\nheterogeneity) to 100 (maximum heterogeneity). All results are reported with 95% confidence\nintervals (95% CI), and all p-values are two-tailed. When a significant\nheterogeneity among the outcomes was found (I2>50), the\nrandom effects model according to DerSimonian-Laird was used22). This model assumes that the true treatment effects in individual\nstudies may be different from one another and that these treatment effects are normally\ndistributed. Those outcomes that did not present with heterogeneity\n(I2<50) were analyzed with the fixed-effects model. The\nfixed-effects model uses the inverse variance approach, and it is assumed that all studies\ncome from a common population. Subgroup analysis was also used to detect heterogeneity\naccording to the muscle groups assessed in each study. The MAS grades assessed immediately\nafter ESWT (I2= 0.0%) and 4 weeks after ESWT\n(I2= 0.0%) were analyzed by the fixed-effects model. Because\nof the small number of studies in each subgroup, we used a funnel plot, Begg&#8217;s test, and\nEgger&#8217;s test simultaneously to detect publication bias. Begg&#8217;s and Egger&#8217;s tests are\nrecommended when there is insufficient evidence23). The analysis was performed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis\nversion 2.0 (Biostat, Englewood, NJ, USA).\nRESULTS\nThe primary search for the effect of ESWT on spasticity in patients with brain injury\nidentified 73 relevant studies, and 32 duplicate studies were discarded. Thirty-four studies\nwere excluded after screening of their abstracts. Two studies were additionally excluded:\none study used botulinum toxin injection before application of ESWT, and the other study\npresented insufficient data for meta-analysis. Ultimately, five studies were included in the\nmeta-analysis. Four studies examined the spasticity of the ankle plantar flexor, and one\nstudy examined wrist and finger flexors (Table\n1Table 1.Studies that evaluated the effect of extracorporeal shock wave therapyYearPublishedAuthorPopulationTestedmuscleNo. ofpatientsFollow-up(weeks)Modified Ashworth ScaleBaselineAfter ESWTp-value4 weeksafter ESWTp-valueMeanSDMeanSDMeanSD2013Gonokova et al.Cerebral palsyPlantar flexor2542.700.092.000.080.0012.150.070.0012010Amelio et al.Cerebral palsyPlantar flexor12123.300.491.800.380.0012.250.450.0012005Manganotti et al.StrokeWrist flexor20123.400.702.000.900.0012.300.700.001Finger flexor20123.200.600.800.400.0011.300.400.0012013Moon et al.StrokePlantar flexor3042.500.671.410.670.0021.750.620.0192011Sohn et al.StrokePlantar flexor10-2.671.151.221.030.035-ESWT = extracorporeal shock wave therapy, Fig. 1Fig. 1.Flow diagram of the study selection process). For quality assessment of the studies included in this meta-analysis, the\nNewcastle-Ottawa Scale was used (Table\n2Table 2.Quality assessments using the Newcastle-Ottawa ScaleYear publishedAuthorNewcastle-Ottawa ScaleSelectionComparabilityExposure2013Gonokova et al.*******2010Amelio et al.*******2005Manganotti et al.*******2013Moon et al.******2011Sohn et al.*&#8722;***).

Six groups from 5 studies were evaluated. The MAS grade was\nsignificantly improved after ESWT compared with the baseline values (standardized mean\ndifference [SMD], &#8722;0.792; 95% CI, &#8722;1.001 to &#8722;0.583; p<0.001) (Fig. 2Fig. 2.Forest plot of the effect assessed immediately after extracorporeal shock wave\ntherapy. Std diff = standard difference; CI = confidence interval; PF = plantar\nflexor; WF = wrist flexor; FF = finger flexor). Significant inter-study heterogeneity was not found (&#967;2 = 2.53, p= 0.77,\nI2 = 0.0%). Begg&#8217;s test (p=0.09) and Egger&#8217;s test (p=0.06)\nsuggested that some bias source might be included in this sample of studies, but the classic\nfail-safe N was 83. Therefore, we concluded that the selected studies were not biased.\nFunnel plot analysis was also performed (Fig.\n3AFig. 3.Funnel plots to assess for publication bias at the time immediately (A) and 4 weeks\n(B) after extracorporeal shock wave therapy. MAS = Modified Ashworth Scale; ESWT =\nExtracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy; Std diff = standard difference). We also performed a subgroup analysis based on the tested muscles, and it did not\nshow any different results (Fig. 4AFig. 4.Forest plot of the subgroup analysis to assess for heterogeneity depending on muscle\ngroups assessed immediately (A) and 4 weeks (B) after extracorporeal shock wave\ntherapy.

Five groups in 4\nstudies were evaluated. The MAS grade was significantly improved after ESWT compared with\nthe baseline values (standardized mean difference [SMD], &#8722;0.735; 95% CI, &#8722;0.951 to &#8722;0.519;\np<0.001) (Fig. 5Fig. 5.Forest plot of the effect assessed 4 weeks after extracorporeal shock wave therapy.\nESWT = Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy; Std diff = standard difference; PF = plantar\nflexor; FF = finger flexor; WF = wrist flexor). Significant inter-study heterogeneity was not found (&#967;2 = 4.706, p=\n0.319, I2 = 14.994%). Begg&#8217;s test (p=0.05) and Egger&#8217;s test\n(p=0.009) suggested that some bias source might be included in this sample of studies.\nHowever, the classic fail-safe N was 59. Therefore, we concluded that the selected studies\nwere not biased. Funnel plot analysis was also performed (Fig. 3B). We also performed a subgroup analysis based on tested muscles, and it\ndid not show any different results (Fig. 4B).\nDISCUSSION\nSpasticity, as defined by Lance in 1980, is a motor disorder characterized by a\nvelocity-dependent increase in tonic stretch reflexes (&#8220;muscle tone&#8221;) with exaggerated\ntendon jerks, resulting from hyperexcitability of the stretch reflex, as one component of\nupper motor neuron syndrome24). The\npathophysiology of spasticity and hypertonus is complex and not clearly understood yet.\nDifferent spinal and supraspinal pathways contribute to it, and multiple neuronal mechanisms\nlead to increased reflex excitability. Even though spasticity and hypertonus provide some\nbenefits to patients25), most of the\nresult of the spasticity may be detrimental. Spasticity can cause discomfort and stiffness\nand limitations in physical activities such as walking, transferring, picking up objects,\nwashing, dressing, or sexual activity26).\nFour of the studies included in this meta-analysis evaluated the reduction of spasticity in\nankle plantar flexors because it has a major functional implication in gait in patients with\ncerebral palsy or stroke27,28,29,30). Poorly managed spasticity of the plantar flexors is\nresponsible for muscle shortening and the development of tendon and soft tissue\ncontractures, leading to an impaired swing phase of gait. One of the studies evaluated\nspasticity of wrist and finger flexors in patients affected by stroke because it may\nseriously impair hand functions and activities of daily living31).A number of pharmacological agents and non-pharmacological treatments such as physical\ntherapy, orthoses, and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) have been tried\nfor the treatment of spasticity and hypertonus32). Chemodenervation also called neurolysis or neuromuscular blockade\nare used to prevent nerve-muscle transmission with perineural injection of phenol33, 34)\nor ethyl alcohol35) and intramuscular\ninjection of botulinum toxin36,37,38,39,40,41). More invasive treatment options such as rhizotomy42,43,44) and intrathecal baclofen45,46,47,48)\ncould be another choice for patients who are resistant to conventional treatments or have\nintractable spasticity. Treatment of spasticity needs to be performed with a stepped care\napproach that begins with simple and reversible treatments that have few side effects and\nproceeds to irreversible treatments that have more side effects.Botulinum toxin injection has been tried in many studies and proven to be effective on\nimproving muscle spasticity36,37,38,39,40,41). However, the efficacy of botulinum toxin injection has\nbeen challenged by several reasons. The formation of neutralizing antibodies after botulinum\ntoxin injection happens in more than one-third of dystonic patients who are labeled as\n&#8220;nonresponders&#8221;49). Other reasons for\nthe lack of response to botulinum toxin injections are inappropriate dosing, changes in the\npattern of muscle involved, incorrect injection sites, reconstitution, and/or storage\nfailure50).The indications for ESWT, which was first applied for lithotripsy7), have expanded to a variety of orthopedic diseases over the\nlast decades. Two different mechanisms of the effect of ESWT are noted; one mechanism of\neffect is the high positive pressure and short rise time, which are responsible for the\ndirect shock wave effect, and the other is the tensile wave for the cavitations, which is\ncalled the indirect shock wave effect51).\nHowever, the mechanism of how the ESWT affects spasticity remains uncertain. Nitric oxide\nhas a very important physiological function in the central nervous system and in the\ntransmission of the nerve impulse in the neuromuscular junction52). A number of studies have investigated the effect of ESWT\nby inducing enzymatic and nonenzymatic nitric oxide synthesis17, 53). Although, it has been\nsuggested that nitric oxide plays an important role in regulating inflammatory events,\nbiomechanical mechanisms underlying these effects have yet to be elucidated19).Although the etiology of spasticity is central, secondary changes in peripheral nerves and\nmuscles are critical factors in producing spasticity. Therefore, most of therapeutic\ninterventions are focused on these secondary changes. There are structural and functional\nchanges in spastic skeletal muscle. Most published micrographs of muscle from spastic\npatients showed abnormalities such as increased fiber size variability, increased number of\nrounded fibers, moth-eaten fibers, and increased extracellular space. In addition, spastic\nmuscles present increased joint stiffness, and this is presumably due to fibrosis within the\nmuscle tissue or an increase in the number of crossbridges attached during contraction.\nMoreover, muscle contractures occur secondary to spasticity due to a reduction in muscle\nfiber length and a decrease in the number of serial sarcomeres within muscle fibers54). One possible effect of ESWT is the\nimprovement in connective tissue stiffness acting on fibrosis of chronic hypertonic muscles.\nThese considerations are consistent with recent studies assessing the advantages of ESWT for\nseveral orthopedic and traumatic indications including problematic soft tissue wound55,56,57).When analyzing the results of ESWT for treatment of spasticity and hypertonus, adopting a\nreliable method for assessing spasticity is challenging. The Ashworth scale, first developed\nin 196458), is the best known scale for\nmeasuring the degree of spasticity26).\nAmong the clinical evaluation tools, the MAS which has a good interrater reliability, was\nadopted for comparing pre- and posttreatment changes in severity of spasticity in this\nmeta-analysis. The meta-analysis indicated that ESWT improved the MAS grade significantly\ncompared with the baseline values. In all studies, the MAS grade decreased in a\nstatistically significant manner at the time immediately after ESWT and at four weeks after\nESWT, and the SMDs and 95% CIs were &#8722;0.792 and &#8722;1.001 to &#8722;0.583 (p<0.001) and &#8722;0.735 and\n&#8722;0.951 to &#8722;0.519 (p<0.001), respectively.There were some limitations to this study. The MAS, even though it is the most frequently\ncited rating scale for measurement of spasticity, does not evaluate the velocity of passive\njoint movement and the angle of contraction outbreak or potential tendon retraction59, 60). Also, even if this scale seems to measure the resistance adequately,\nthe reduced range of joint motion due to contracture might limit its reliability61).Therefore, the MAS does not substantially reflect spasticity according to Lance&#8217;s\ndefinition, that is, a motor disorder characterized by a velocity-dependent increase in\nmuscle tone24). On the other hand, the\nModified Tardieu Scale does take into account the velocity of passive joint movement and\nassess the angle of catch and the speed at which the catch was obtained forms the basis of\nthe measure of spasticity. In addition, the Modified Tardieu Scale is more sensitive in the\ndetection of posttreatment changes because it measures muscle resistance as well as the\nvelocity of the movement that induces muscular contraction62).Another limitation of the present study was that the MAS does not include clinical features\nincluding pain, spasm, and impact of function that could be associated with spasticity. The\nclinical impacts of spasticity that discourage patients include spasm or pain accompanied by\nhypertonicity; functional deterioration of activities of daily living such as walking,\ntransferring, dressing and washing; and burden placed on caregivers. Therefore, other\nclinical assessment scales such as the visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain assessment,\nspasm frequency scale (SFS) or clonus score, daily functional assessment scales, and\npatient/caregiver goal assessment scale should be included in future studies.A third limitation is the short follow-up periods in the included studies. The average\nfollow-up duration was only 4 weeks in two studies and was 12 weeks in two other studies;\nthe final study evaluated immediate effects of ESWT only. Therefore, it is difficult to\nsuggest the optimal treatment interval from this meta-analysis. Long-term follow-up studies\nare needed in future studies.", "pmid": "25364134", "title": "Effects of Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy on Spasticity in Patients after\nBrain Injury: A Meta-analysis", "journal_title": "Journal of Physical Therapy Science", "authors": "Jin-Youn Lee;Soo-Nyung Kim;In-Sik Lee;Heeyoune Jung;Kyeong-Soo Lee;Seong-Eun Koh", "doi": "10.1589/jpts.26.1641", "score": "0.009138545"}, {"keywords": "", "abstract": "Background\nThere is an increasing focus on the use of patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures to improve the quality and effectiveness of health care.

PRO is a measurement based on a report that comes directly from the patient about the status of that patient&#8217;s health condition [2]. In Denmark, since 2016, PRO-systems are being implemented on a large scale, based on national initiatives [3]. However, we know little about what happens when ideas on a macro level hit the clinical practice arena [4].What we know is that PROs have potential for allowing patients to actively participate in their own care [5&#8211;7]. Studies indicate that management of symptoms may be improved by the use of PRO measures in clinical practice and increase symptom-related actions by both patients and clinicians [8, 9]. A number of studies suggest that the use of PRO measures in clinical practice can improve patient-clinician communication, given that PRO data can be an incentive to patient-centred communication [10&#8211;14]. A systematic review of the impact of routine collection of PRO data found strong evidence that well-implemented PRO measures improved patient-provider communication and patient satisfaction but found only weak evidence for the impact of PRO measures on changes regarding patients&#8217; self- management, health outcomes and health behavior [10].The patient perspective has received little consideration when it comes to PRO measures in routine clinical practice and as a means of self-management support. In spite of the promising benefits, research has also emphasized that PRO measures cannot be considered a self-acting mechanism that necessarily leads to patient involvement [7, 15]. Specifically, a systematic review of the experiences of professionals&#8217; use of PRO data to improve the quality of health care documented barriers to implementing PRO measures such as skepticism about the validity of patient self-reported data and preferences for physiological measurements [6]. Thus, a series of conditions and mechanisms may influence the use of PRO measures in clinical practice as a method for self-management support.Self-management is defined as &#8220;the individual&#8217;s ability to manage symptoms, treatment, physical and psychosocial consequences and life style changes inherent in life with long term conditions&#8221; [16]. As the lives of patients with epilepsy not only include endurance of a predisposition to generate epileptic seizures but also neurobiological, cognitive, psychological and social consequences of this condition [17], we considered epilepsy to be an appropriate case exemplar for this study.We aimed at exploring how patients with epilepsy experience PRO-based follow-up used in three outpatient clinics in the Central Denmark Region, where PRO data is used as the basis for demand driven outpatient follow-up. We also sought to explain how these experiences related to self-management in PRO-based follow-up.\nMethods\n\nInterpretive description\nWe chose Interpretive Description (ID) [18] as the methodological approach. ID is an applied, inductive research strategy stressing the importance of conducting research arising from and with the aim of improving clinical practice [18]. ID differs from other methodologies as it draws on elements derived from phenomenology, grounded theory and ethnography but refrains from formalizing specific techniques and procedures as ultimate standards and goals of research [18]. Thus, ID does not prescribe an exact way to carry out the study, but rather represents an operating logic within which qualitative studies can be designed and enacted [18]. In accordance with ID we gathered and analyzed data concurrently, and thus let the preliminary data analysis guide the subsequent data collection. Preliminary analyses were noted in an audit trail throughout the research process to provide transparency.\nSetting\nAmbuFlex is a generic web-administered PRO-system which aims to improve quality of care, increase the patient-centeredness of care, and reallocate health care resources by using PRO measures as the basis for follow-up [19, 20]. This is termed PRO-based follow-up. Thus, AmbuFlex differs from the traditional use of PRO measures in clinical practice, where PRO measures often just compose a supplement to the patient&#8217;s follow-up. PRO-based follow-up represents a new model of service delivery where the patient&#8217;s PRO measures are used as the very basis for outpatient follow-up. In PRO-based follow-up, regularly scheduled follow-ups are substituted with regular diagnosis-specific questionnaires filled in by the patient at home. The patients&#8217; PRO-data are used by clinicians as a decision aid to identify those who need clinical attention based on an automated PRO-algorithm [21]. The patients can in all cases request a contact and thereby overrule any automated decision of no visit needed.AmbuFlex/Epilepsy was implemented in 2012 in three different hospitals in The Central Denmark Region, and is standard follow-up for approximately 70% of all epilepsy outpatients in these clinics [20]. As of December 2017, 5181 epilepsy outpatients have been referred to AmbuFlex/Epilepsy, based on a clinical assessment of the patient&#8217;s health status and their ability to fill in questionnaires. The questionnaire encompasses information about health-related quality of life, seizures, other symptoms, information specific to aspects of daily life with epilepsy and the patient&#8217;s perception of well-being (Additional&#160;file&#160;1). At the time of the data collection patients were not able to access their PRO measures once they had submitted their response, thus the patient&#8217;s PRO measures were only fed back to the clinicians.\nSampling and data collection\nData collection was conducted by the first author and consisted of in-depth semi-structured interviews with 29 patients (Table&#160;1). Interviews were conducted from December 2015 to June 2017 and were carried out in the patients&#8217; home, except three interviews which, on patients&#8217; requests, took place at the hospital. The inclusion criteria were patients referred to AmbuFlex/Epilepsy who had completed at least two PRO questionnaires. Using general questions and prompts designed to release patient narratives, participants were invited to share their personal experiences of AmbuFlex. The sampling was planned as purposive. Prior to the interviews we aimed to include patients representing a diversity in duration of epilepsy, gender and age. In accordance with the ID strategy of maximal variation associated with an evolving analysis, we supplemented our purposive sampling strategy with theoretical sampling [18]. Thus, when hunches about patterns and themes emerged during data collection and analysis, we sought to include specific types of participants to check if what we saw was an artifact of some unexplained characteristics of our current sample. For example, in the preliminary analysis we found great differences in patients&#8217; experiences of feeling safe or abandoned in PRO-based follow-up. To be sure that these experiences could not be ascribed to patients&#8217; established relation (or the lack of such) with the clinicians, we sampled participants with no or only minimal follow-up experiences prior to their enrolment into PRO-based follow-up. A diversity of experiences related to feeling safe or abandoned was identified amongst these participants, thus theoretical sampling helped us refine our claim about contrasting experiences. Although we had initially anticipated that a sample of 15&#8211;20 participants would be sufficient to yield thematic patterns within the dataset, the various nature of the documented experiences led us to continue recruitment. After 29 interviews had been completed, we concluded that sufficient common aspects were apparent in the dataset and the thematic patterns were sufficiently substantial to permit a comprehensive conceptual description of the whole.Table 1Participant profileN&#160;=&#8201;29 (%)Gender&#8195;Female15 (52)&#8195;Male14 (48)Age&#8195;20&#8211;3510 (34)&#8195;36&#8211;504 (14)&#8195;51&#8211;657 (24)&#8195;>&#8201;658 (28)Duration of epilepsy (years)&#8195;&#8201;453 (10)Cohabitation&#8195;Living with a partner24 (83)&#8195;Living alone5 (17)Occupational status&#8195;Working16 (55)&#8195;Not working13 (45)\nAnalysis\nAll interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim by the first author. Data management was facilitated by the qualitative software program NVivo&#8482; [22]. In accordance with ID concurrent data collection and analysis were performed [18]. Thus, preliminary analysis of the data influenced the consequent data collection. For example, an initial analysis revealed signs that some patients made different lifestyle choices due to PRO-based follow-up. Thus, a focus on PRO measures&#8217; influence on health behavior was incorporated into the interview guide.The first author conducted the initial rounds of analysis identifying patterns and subsequently themes, which were discussed and adjusted in close cooperation with the last author supported by discussions with co-authors. Once all data was gathered we conducted the final analysis with the first author being responsible of digging into the full data material. After carefully having read all the transcripts we organized data segments together that seemed to reflect similar properties, increasingly arranging the data in terms of patterns. Next, more formal coding was conducted, starting with a broad-based coding in order to avoid premature interpretations. As our data was organized in groups that might be thematically related, the specific dimensions of patients&#8217; experiences were increasingly clustered into recurring themes. These tentative groupings allowed us to consider the patterns and variety within those groups across the whole material. As the analysis process developed and possible relationships between the groups of data became more apparent, we could finally conceptualize the findings by extracting thematic patterns that represent the potential of PRO-based follow up as a means of self-management support.\nResults\nPotential participants were identified and approached by nurses from the three outpatient clinics and all agreed to participant in the interview, thus the final sample consisted of the 29 contacted patients (Table 1).In general, our analysis revealed diverging attitudes toward PRO-based follow-up. For some patients, PRO-based follow-up was perceived as a quality improvement of the outpatient service. In particular, they valued the increased influence they could have on their follow-up. For other patients, PRO-based follow-up was experienced as a deterioration of the outpatient service. We found considerable variation in the influence of PRO-based follow-up on capacity for self-management. For some patients, signs that PRO measures were increasing their self-management capacity were clear. For others, we found equally clear indications that the procedure was impeding their follow-up experience and contact with the outpatient clinic. These contrasting experiences could explain both the supportive and inhibiting mechanisms relative to self-management. In representing experiences from opposite sides of a spectrum that covers significant variation in the documented experiences regarding PRO-based follow-up as a means of self-management support, the observed complexities can be illuminated. Illustrative quotations appear in Table&#160;2.Table 2Examples of participants&#8217; quotesSupporting mechanisms&#8195;Increasing awareness of psychosocial problemsAt least the questionnaire is more profound than the usual how-are-you-questions. It seems as if they take you a bit more seriously now than they did before (68&#160;years old man).&#8195;Improving communicationWell, I think it is very nice. The questions are much more everyday questions. That makes it much easier to explain and describe how your epilepsy actually is. Because you try and you try to explain how it is and how it feels to your close ones and to the doctors, but it is so hard to explain in a way that normal people can imagine how your body experiences it (28&#160;year old woman).&#8195;Increasing understanding of symptoms and diseaseIt gets you thinking. It makes you consider things. Because I actually didn&#8217;t know that you could lose your sexual drive because of the medicine and that stuff. I surely didn&#8217;t know that before I saw the questionnaire (56&#160;year old woman).Before I start to fill it in, I stop and think carefully about why the questions are there in the first place. They must be linked to the epilepsy. It isn&#8217;t like you have to find five errors [as in an intelligence test] or something like that. So, all the questions must have something to do with the epilepsy, right? And that makes you aware of symptoms that you must be attentive to (60&#160;year old man).&#8195;Facilitating change in health behaviorThere are things you do that you don&#8217;t link to the epilepsy by yourselves, but they can actually have an influence. So, in that way it can actually kind of guide you. [For example], maybe I should try and sleep a bit longer (28&#160;year old woman).I actually think that just filling in the questionnaire and just by ticking those boxes made me more conscious, and then I said to myself &#8220;okay now I need to take on responsibility, because it is my life.&#8221; (48&#160;year old man).&#8195;Strengthening autonomy, flexibility and freedomI really think it is very very good alternative. I especially appreciate the fact that I actually get to control it myself (&#8230;). I really like the part that I can control my follow-up by saying &#8220;Do you know what? Now I need help.&#8221; (24&#160;year old woman).I actually think it is all right [the fact that there is no routine visit anymore]. Because, I really don&#8217;t feel that I suffer from epilepsy. I actually don&#8217;t feel like that. I feel well in my everyday life, so I kind of forget that I have epilepsy. And sometimes I try to tell myself, that it is just something that they have made up. I don&#8217;t like the epilepsy, and this makes me feel less ill (66&#160;year old man).Inhibitors for self-management&#8195;Inducing feelings of rejection and disconnectionWhen you write that you have lost your libido and you have gained weight, then what happens? Well, if I had been sitting in front of the nurse, then I would expect that she maybe could help me in some way (&#8230;) But if I just write it in the questionnaire, then what happens? &#8211; Nothing. Because I have never heard anything back, and I have been writing these things time after time (56&#160;year old woman).I demand to know how my disease is developing! I want to know, is it okay? I would also like to have the possibility to ask some questions (&#8230;) I would really like to have the opportunity to tell how I feel and how I experience the side effects, and I don&#8217;t think that I have those opportunities now (23&#160;year old woman).They never [expletive] react to it. So, I wonder, why do they ask about it in the first place? Honestly, why do they ask? Well, they don&#8217;t care about it at all. The only thing they react to is the medicine stuff. Why the [expletive] should I fill it in, then? It is nothing but a waste of time (58&#160;year old woman).But I really think they ought to react to it - to follow up on the problems. Otherwise it is just like you disappear (47&#160;year old woman).You somehow feel that you are abandoned from the system when you only have this [lays his hand on the questionnaire] (60&#160;year old man).&#8195;Incomprehension of purpose of PRO-based follow-upIt is a survey. (&#8230;) I see it as some kind of data collection, a method for some nurses and doctors to become smarter on the disease (63&#160;year old man).Well, they can&#8217;t use my part in itself. I think it is more in general that they use it. To see if people who take these medicines and who have epilepsy, to see if they have a direction, I think. So, I don&#8217;t think, that they use exactly my questionnaire, except as one in many (32&#160;year old man).&#8195;PRO measures are perceived as being too standardized and negativeBut I really don&#8217;t think all those things have anything to do with how I have epilepsy (23&#160;year old woman).There are questions or areas that I personally think the questionnaire is lacking (&#8230;) In that way it can be difficult to fill it in, because I don&#8217;t think it fits 100% to my person (39&#160;year old man).P: It is terrible, just terrible. Honestly, I must say, it is terrible to fill in. Because I don&#8217;t want to have anything to do with it any more.I: Do the questionnaire remind you of your epilepsy?P: Yes, it does, and the fact that it has been much worse, and it make me think; what if it gets worse again? (&#8230;) I really feel like they start to pull something up, and for some of the questions I think; why is it their concern? (67&#160;year old woman).There are so many negative questions, so many around depression and suicide thoughts and that sort of stuff. It is very negative. And I think; what shall I do with that? Because I didn&#8217;t think I had those troubles, but when they are presented in that way in questionnaire, you actually come to be a bit negative yourself (32&#160;year old man).&#8195;Lack of confidence in own ability to assess health status and need of contactWho is to say that I&#8217;m right in my responses? (26&#160;year old woman).Well, we are not supposed to be doctors, we are not supposed to assess our own health, because there are some people who are professionally educated to do that (39&#160;year old man).It is hard to assess, because do I have a need to be contacted? Well, it is really difficult to assess, because I&#8217;m not the expert in this game (60&#160;year old man).I thought to myself; well, is this really a proper reason for asking for contact. Because you do know that there is a need for cost-savings, so I wouldn&#8217;t want to intrude or be demanding. So, I feel that there must really be a proper reason, but you can be very insecure if the reason is proper enough, and that is hard. (26&#160;year old woman).\nSupportive mechanisms\n\nIncreasing awareness of psychosocial problems\nOn account of PRO questions related to wellbeing and everyday life, patients who experienced the process favorably reported it as having a positive focus on psychosocial problems. These &#8216;soft&#8217; questions were interpreted as a signal from the outpatient clinic that these were important areas for consideration and that the clinicians were interested in the whole person, not just the medical management. These patients thought of PRO-based follow-up as more personal and profound than the traditional follow-up, because previously the consultation focus was always limited to information about medicines and seizures. In addition, the comprehensive questionnaire and the weighting of the patient&#8217;s view and opinion on their own health status were understood as the clinicians taking patients more seriously. This awareness about potential psychosocial problems was valued by these patients and could potentially make it easier to handle psychosocial impact of epilepsy on everyday life.\nImproving communication\nPRO-based follow-up also resulted in an experience of improved communication for many patients. They stated that it provided them with a disease-specific vocabulary that allowed them to explain to the clinicians and to their relatives how they felt, and what it was like to live with epilepsy. They felt that the questionnaire prompted them to discuss psychosocial issues in relation to the disease with their relatives. These patients also found that the questionnaire &#8216;allowed&#8217; them to initiate discussions with clinicians concerning problems like sadness, anxiety or problems with sexuality. Thus, PRO measures were perceived as a legitimization of conversations on a range of topics they might otherwise have avoided.\nIncreasing understanding of symptoms and disease\nThis group of patients felt that the PRO questionnaire could give rise to personal reflection. When reflecting on symptoms, they became more aware about the link between specific symptoms and the disease process, which resulted in a better understanding of the disease and its manifestations. Filling in the questionnaire made it easier for them to assess their need for contact, because PRO measures gave them a good understanding of their health status. The PRO questions could also clarify that epilepsy is an aspect in their everyday life and thus not restricted to seizures and medicine. In this manner, they reported that filling in the PRO questionnaire could lead to an increased acceptance and sense of security, because now they could legitimately relate their symptoms to epilepsy.\nFacilitating change in health behavior\nFilling in the PRO questionnaire further prompted some to take stock of their way of living with epilepsy. It made them pause to think carefully about the way in which their epilepsy was developing and reflect on their health-related actions. Thus, PRO measures gave rise to reflection and the reflection then led to acting differently when it came to sleeping patterns, dietary habits, medication management and alcohol intake. Many of the patients therefore felt it resulted in making different choices, choices that were more in line with recommendations from the outpatient clinics regarding health behavior and epilepsy. Thus, the PRO-based follow-up mediated processes by which some patients believed they were handling the epilepsy in a healthier way.\nStrengthening autonomy, flexibility and freedom\nMany patients valued assessing their own health status and need for contact, as it gave them a feeling of being in charge and a positive feeling of taking responsibility for their own disease. They appreciated the fact that they were given a choice as to whether or not they wanted a consultation. In this way, the PRO-based follow-up strengthened their autonomy, as it provided them with an actual influence on their follow-up. In addition, the fact that there were no routine consultations any more was highly valued, as it made follow-up more flexible. This flexibility had an impact on the patient&#8217;s everyday life, including work life. When they were no longer obligated to come to a routine visit, they reported that they felt less ill. They did not have to arrange to get off from work because they could fill in the questionnaire whenever it best suited them, and that gave them a sense of flexibility and freedom. The strengthened autonomy and the increased sense of flexibility and freedom signified that the epilepsy had to some extent faded into the background, and allowed their &#8216;patient identity&#8217; to become less dominant.\nInhibiting mechanisms\n\nInducing feelings of rejection and disconnection\nA substantial barrier for PRO-based follow-up to support self-management for some of the patients in this study was an experience of feeling intercepted by the approach and therefore rejected by the health care system and the clinicians. For the most part, the experience associated with this rejection was lack of response. Even though these patients had stated problems in the PRO questionnaire, some reported that they had not received a response. Because questions were posed about wellbeing and problems such as with sexuality, they expected a response if they had indicated a problem in these areas. In such instances, they often found that the response given to their PRO data was overly superficial. As a result, they developed the clear conception that it was only those PRO measures that were related to seizures or medicine that the clinicians would respond to, and were thus convinced that different PRO questions rank differently. When these patients experienced no response to the problems they reported, their motivation for filling in the PRO measures decreased. Lack of response or the experience of a superficial response could leave such patients with a feeling of being abandoned and alone. In this way, they concluded that the PRO-based follow-up had intercepted their capacity to benefit from the expert and the experts&#8217; assessment of the disease.\nIncomprehension of the purpose of PRO-based follow-up\nAnother barrier some patients reported occurred in situations in which they missed or misunderstood the purpose of PRO-based follow-up. Some thought of the questionnaire strictly as the clinician&#8217;s work tool to collect data or as a cost saving tool for the healthcare system. They were not even aware that their PRO data were handled individually, and thought of the questionnaire as a survey for research purposes. Furthermore, when the questions made no sense, or patients could not see the link between the questions and the epilepsy, they wondered why the clinicians wanted information on all these areas.\nPRO measures are too standardized and negative\nSeveral patients pointed out that the PRO measures did not reflect the way their own epilepsy was manifest. In such situations, patients could not recognize themselves in the questionnaire. They found it too standardized and rigid and therefore demanded better possibilities to elaborate upon their answers. Thus, some of these patients found that the PRO measures restricted their communication about their epilepsy with the clinicians, as the questionnaire only allowed for patients to communicate on certain issues. In some instances, PRO measures were seen as a painful reminder of the severity of the disease. Certain questions in the PRO questionnaire, such as whether they had considered suicide, made some patients worry about what the future might bring. These patients emphasized that such questions were very negative, and explained that such questions negatively influenced their mood. Where they felt that the questions were particularly intrusive, some patients reported filling out the answers in a superficial manner in order to avoid feeling uncomfortable.\nLack of confidence in own ability to assess health status and need of contact\nSome patients found it difficult to fill in the PRO questionnaire because they had a hard time distinguishing between symptoms related to epilepsy and more general symptoms or sensations. Where they lacked confidence in their own ability to assess their symptoms and health status, these patients emphasized that they had been given too much responsibility, and that made them feel insecure and unsafe. Several reported that they would prefer the clinicians doing the assessment. Furthermore, some found it difficult to assess their own need for contact, given that they did not see themselves as experts. Some also found it hard to request a contact if they had not stated any problems in the PRO measures. In this manner, patients had a clear sense of a PRO hierarchy, in that not all PRO questions legitimized a wish for contact. For the most part, questions related to seizures or medicine were viewed as more important than questions related to psychosocial problems.\nSense of ownership\nIn searching for possible understandings of the conditions under which inhibiting and supporting mechanisms arose, we propose a sense of ownership towards PRO-based follow-up as a possible explanatory mechanism (Fig.&#160;1). When we looked at cases in which PRO measures&#8217; supporting mechanisms had been realized and in those in which the experiences were negative, we could see a difference in terms of the active agency of the patient in engaging with the system. Patients for whom the PRO-based follow-up seemed to increase their capacity for self-management were, for example, more likely to use possessive pronouns when they were referring to the PRO measures or the follow-up. Furthermore, these patients were more likely to express positive reflections regarding their role in the follow-up, and they described themselves as feeling comfortable with making the active choice regarding need for contact. Other patients, on the contrary, seemed to verbally distance themselves from PRO-based follow-up by emphasizing that it was the clinicians&#8217; work tool, not their own. These patients furthermore tended to focus on what the healthcare system gained from PRO-based follow-up. In those cases, the patients tended to express experiences of PRO-based follow-up as a rigid and simplistic system, with no room for influence. Given that we interpret these differences in the active agency as related to differences in sense of ownership towards PRO-based follow-up, it seemed that ownership towards PRO-based follow-up created the conditions under which supporting mechanisms for self-management development could be realized.Fig. 1PRO-based follow-up&#8217;s influence on capacity for self-management. The figure represents inhibiting and supporting mechanisms for patients&#8217; capacity for self-management. The double-arrow illustrates differences in experiences of ownership towards PRO-based follow-up on a spectrum from lack of ownership to sense of ownership as a possible explanatory mechanism\nDiscussion\nIn this interpretive description study we found signs of PRO-based follow-up leading to an increased capacity for self-management for some patients whereas, for other patients, PRO-based follow-up had no influence on their ability to manage the epilepsy or, in some instances had a negative influence on their perception of their follow-up and their contact to the clinic. For the most part, the supporting mechanisms for self-management found in our analysis reflect the general patterns that have been reported in the literature. For example, the improvement in communications is in line with findings reported in several other studies of PRO measures in clinical practice [7, 8, 11, 23]. The increased awareness of psychosocial problems and an increased understanding of the disease has also been recognized in previous research [7, 24, 25]. Accordingly, some of the inhibiting mechanisms we found have also been recognized in prior reports [7, 23]. The patients experienced that it was only PRO questions about seizures or medicines that the clinicians would respond to. This is in line with prior research in relation to the use of PRO measures in cancer care, which highlights that high score PRO data might not be explored further if health care providers do not relate them to the disease or the treatment [23]. Furthermore, there seems reason to consider if some of the inhibiting mechanisms found in our study are linked to elements of the PRO system not being designed to optimize patient or clinician engagement. Perhaps, one way to optimize clinician engagement could be to train clinicians in deliberate use of PRO measures in the patient-clinician encounter. Such a notion is in line with conclusions from research in oncology, pediatrics, and lung transplant, which argue that there is a need to train clinicians in how to use PRO measures and for recommendations on how to respond to issues identified by PRO measures [26, 27].What stands out in our findings, compared to previous research in relation to PRO-based follow-up, are mechanisms related to patients&#8217; experiences of being responsible for the assessment of health status and need of contact. In our study, it became evident that patients had different attitudes towards the responsibility and activity induced by PRO-based follow-up. This variation in preferences for being active is in agreement with Roter&#8217;s [28] framework of different models of patient-centered communications and the associated expected roles, and with Riiskj&#230;r&#8217;s [29] distinction between active and passive patients based on their information-seeking behavior. Furthermore, this variation in preferences for being active accords with the constructs behind the Control Preferences Scale (CPS) [30]. CPS is designed to elicit consumers&#8217; preferences regarding participation in health-care decisions. Differentiating between different roles consumers can assume, the CPS offers an understanding of variations in the degree of control that different patients prefer in the context of treatment decision-making [30].In the CPS, three roles are described -- the active role, the collaborative role and the passive role -- representing patient preferences for participating in decisions. With the CPS, patients are hypothesized to have different preferences about keeping control over treatment (the active role), sharing control with their physician (the collaborative role), or relinquishing control to their physician (the passive role) [30]. These typologies can be reflected in the patients&#8217; experiences depicted in our study. In our findings, we saw both positive and negative attitudes towards the anticipated active patient participation that is embedded in PRO-based follow-up. For some patients, the embedded participation contributed to a strengthened autonomy and increased their sense of freedom, whereas for others, the embedded participation was accompanied with a feeling of rejection and disconnection to the clinicians. These negative attitudes can be interpreted as a preference for a passive role, whereas the positive experiences can be seen as preferences for a collaborative or active role in the follow-up. Thus, our findings give reason to consider if PRO-based follow-up will be most appropriate for patients who have an individual preference for holding an active or collaborative role in their follow-up.There are some limitations to our study. Concerning transferability, we acknowledge that although patients with epilepsy are used as an exemplar case in our study, there may be some characteristics associated with this seizure disease that are dissimilar to the characteristics of other long-term conditions. Given that epilepsy is a condition in which fear of seizure can perhaps influence the patients need for &#8216;being close to&#8217; the experts, further deliberation would be appropriate to determine whether the resistance towards the responsibility of assessing health status and need of contact identified in this population may be more extensive than with other patient populations. Another limitation to our study is the fact that the participants were all current users of the PRO-based follow-up. It could have been beneficial to also include patients who had dropped out of PRO-based follow-up. Thus, further research should both include other long-term conditions and attention to the group of patients that for some reason are not able to remain in PRO-based follow-up. Nonetheless, we expect these findings may have relevance for other contexts where patients with long-term conditions enter PRO-based follow-up, as they shed light on supporting and inhibiting mechanisms in PRO-based follow-up to support self-management.In order to enhance the potential of PRO measures to increase patients&#8217; capacity for self-management, we suggest bringing a clinical awareness to the issue of the quality of the introduction to the PRO-based follow-up to the patients. By enhancing comprehension of the explicit purpose of PRO-based follow-up, the patient&#8217;s sense of ownership towards the follow-up could potentially increase. Additionally, we suggest that the decision regarding the individual patient&#8217;s participation in PRO-based follow-up could be a shared decision (between clinician and patient) possibly supported by a decision aid. Such a decision aid could be based on the various possibilities and inhibitors found in this study. Given the issues that patients raised about the inappropriateness and negatively of some PRO measures, careful considerations regarding the selection of specific PRO measures are recommended before starting routine monitoring.\nConclusion\nThis study draws attention to patients&#8217; experiences of PRO-based follow-up as a means of self-management support. The findings demonstrate broad variation in the influences of PRO measures on patient&#8217;s self-management in life with epilepsy. Sense of ownership may explain this variation. We suggest supplementary clinical initiatives in order to enhance the benefits from PRO-based follow-up, particularly on how patients are allocated to this health care service.\nAdditional file\n\nNone\n\nAdditional file 1:Epilepsy questionnaire.

The intermediate Reynolds number regime is particularly important, because the vast majority of organisms in the aphotic ocean (i.e. regions that are 200&#8201;m beneath the sea surface) are small (mm-cm) and their motion is governed by the balance of inertial and viscous forces. Our study shows that the mixing efficiency and the diapycnal eddy diffusivity, a measure of vertical mass flux, within a suspension of squirmers increases with Reynolds number. The mixing efficiency is in the range of O(0.0001&#8211;0.04) when the swimming Reynolds number is in the range of O(0.1&#8211;100). The values of diapycnal eddy diffusivity and Cox number are two orders of magnitude larger for vertically swimming cells compared to horizontally swimming cells. For a suspension of squirmers in a decaying isotropic turbulence, we find that the diapycnal eddy diffusivity enhances due to the strong viscous dissipation generated by squirmers as well as the interaction of squirmers with the background turbulence.", "body": "Numerical Framework\nWe performed a fully-resolved three dimensional direct numerical simulation of a suspension of squirmers. Although the squirmer model was originally proposed to study low Reynolds number swimming1819, it has been recently extended to the inertial regime202122. It effectively models the flow generated by a coordinated beating of cilia on the surface of organisms, such as ctenophora, living worldwide in marine environments23. Their sizes range from millimeters to centimeters, and their Reynolds number is on the order of O(102). For a spherical squirmer, an axisymmetric tangential surface velocity is given as18where &#952; is the polar angle measured from the swimming direction, &#946; scales with a&#969;/U, &#969; is the vorticity generated by the squirmer, U and a are the characteristic swimming velocity and the radius of the squirmer, respectively. For example, a&#969;/U for the copepod nauplii (Temora longicornis) is about two in a swimming mode (&#969;&#8201;~&#8201;70&#8201;s&#8722;1, a&#8201;~&#8201;300&#8201;&#956;m, U&#8201;~&#8201;10&#8722;2&#8201;m&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;s&#8722;1)24. &#946; is positive (negative) for the organisms generating trust in front of (behind) their body called puller (pusher). The puller brings fluid from front and back and expels it from the side, while pusher does the opposite. The flow generated by a squirmer in a stratified fluid strongly affects the density field and consequently, the squirmer&#8217;s motion25. Here, we investigate the mixing induced by a suspension of squirmers in stratified fluids in the absence and presence of the background turbulence. We should note, however, that the squirmer is only a reduced-order model for the locomotion of organisms. This reduced-order squirmer model has been broadly employed to examine various aspects of swimming at low Reynolds number, such as hydrodynamic interaction of two organisms26, swimming near a wall19, suspension dynamics27, and optimal feeding28.The governing equations for an incompressible viscous fluid under Boussinesq approximation are given aswhere u&#8201;=&#8201;(u, v, w) is the flow velocity,  is the density perturbation from the linear background density profile , p is the disturbance pressure, &#956; is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid,  is the gravitational acceleration,  is the unit vector along the direction of gravity, T is the temperature, and &#954; is the thermal diffusivity. The body force f in Equation (4) accounts for the hydrodynamic effect imposed by freely swimming squirmers29. The density &#961; and &#961;* can be written as &#961;&#8201;=&#8201;&#961;f&#8201;+&#8201;(&#961;p&#8201;&#8722;&#8201;&#961;0)&#934; and &#961;*&#8201;=&#8201;&#961;0&#8201;+&#8201;(&#961;p&#8201;&#8722;&#8201;&#961;0)&#934;, respectively, where &#961;f is the fluid density, &#961;0 is the volume-averaged density of the fluid, and &#961;p is the squirmer density. The phase indicator parameter &#934; is unity inside the squirmer and zero elsewhere in the computational domain. Equations (3, 4, 5) are derived from the conservation of mass, momentum, and energy for an incompressible fluid, respectively. The density variation across thermocline occurs due to the vertical variation in temperature, , where &#946;T is the thermal expansion coefficient,  is the temperature perturbation and  is the linear background temperature. The diffusivity coefficients are assumed to be uniform and the same for the squirmer and the background fluid30. In order to obtain a steady-state condition, we set , where  and  correspond to the thermal expansion coefficient of the squirmer and background fluid, respectively. Equation (5) can be rewritten in terms of temperature perturbation T&#8242; asThe density of the background fluid linearly changes with temperature, which is an appropriate assumption for centimeter size organisms. The magnitude of the stratification can be characterized by the Brunt-V&#228;is&#228;l&#228; frequency, . Considering both mild and strong density gradients in the ocean, the value of N is around 10&#8722;4&#8201;&#8722;&#8201;0.3&#8201;s&#8722;13132. The dynamics of swimming in a stratified fluid can be characterized by three independent dimensionless parameters. The buoyancy effects can be characterized by Froude number Fr&#8201;=&#8201;U/(Na). Reynolds number Re&#8201;=&#8201;Ua/&#957; characterizes the ratio of inertial to viscous forces. The Prandtl number Pr&#8201;=&#8201;&#957;/&#954; measures the ratio of the momentum diffusivity &#957; to the thermal diffusivity &#954;, and its value is about 7 for temperature stratified fluids. Equations (3), (4), and (6) are solved numerically, the details of which are given in the &#8216;Methods&#8217; section. Unless otherwise stated, squirmers are force-free, torque-free and neutrally buoyant (&#961;p&#8201;=&#8201;&#961;0) and they are initially oriented along the gravitational direction. The simulations are continued till the entire system reaches quasi-steady state when both kinetic energy and temperature perturbation satisfy12\nResults\nWe performed simulations for a swarm of pushers and pullers in the range of Reynolds number between 0.1 and 100 in a linearly stratified fluid in the absence and presence of background turbulence. The biogenic mixing process is quantified by calculating the mixing properties, such as mixing efficiency, diapycnal eddy diffusivity, and Cox number.Huntley and Zhou7 have provided the empirical relationship for the packing density of the organisms in the ocean. The volume fraction for escaping mode &#981;e and cruising mode &#981;c can be estimated asThe estimated volume fraction of organisms swimming at Re&#8201;=&#8201;10 is &#981;e&#8201;=&#8201;4.6% and &#981;c&#8201;=&#8201;1.34%. The volume fraction of marine organisms at an intermediate Reynolds number rarely exceeds 4%7. In this study, unless otherwise stated, we consider a volume fraction of 4% to obtain an upper bound of the biogenic mixing. Hydrodynamic interactions at this volume fraction, corresponding to a semi-dilute regime (<10%), are mainly pairwise27. Consequently, small number of squirmers can accurately capture the physics of the problem.\nMixing efficiency\nFor a swarm of squirmers in a linearly stratified fluid, the kinetic energy equation, in a quasi-steady state, is written aswhere S represents the squirmers&#8217; surfaces, n is the unit vector normal to the surface S, V is the entire fluid domain, and E is the strain rate tensor. The term on the left hand side of equation (10) is the total energy input generated by squirmers. The first and second terms on the right hand side of equation (10) represent the viscous dissipation and the rate of creation of gravitational potential energy in the entire fluid domain, respectively. The energy input is generated due to the fluid stress &#963; at the surface of the squirmers. Consequently, the disturbance induced by the freely moving squirmers is the main source of mechanical energy input to the surrounding fluid. On the other hand, turbulent mixing imports mechanical energy through the turbulent production term. For example, in a shear turbulence, the turbulent production term is , where  is the turbulent Reynolds stress tensor and &#8706;&#360;/&#8706;x is the mean shear of the turbulence. The efficiency of turbulent mixing, also called the flux Richardson number, has been defined as the ratio of the rate of removal of energy by the buoyancy forces to the total turbulent energy production3334. The total energy input balances the viscous dissipation and the buoyancy flux of the fluid. The efficiency &#915; for a biogenic mixing process is defined aswhere overbar denotes the averaged quantities over the entire fluid domain. Wagner et al. utilized equation (11) to estimate the mixing efficiency induced by a single micron-size microorganism which is on the order of 10&#8722;8 in an ocean environment12. The analytic solution was derived using solution of point force singularities in a stratified fluid13 for a visco-diffusive regime, where the inertial effects are neglected. For a suspension of squirmers in a linearly stratified fluid, we find that the mixing efficiency increases with inertia (Fig. 1a). For 10&#8201;<&#8201;Re&#8201;<&#8201;100 and |&#946;|&#8201;=&#8201;5, the mixing efficiency achieved by pushers is larger than pullers. The largest mixing efficiency produced by squirmers is (0.042&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.0036) for Re&#8201;=&#8201;100, &#946;&#8201;=&#8201;1 and Fr&#8201;~&#8201;5.2 which is a strong stratification (deeper estuaries have a typical value of N&#8201;~&#8201;0.132, leading to a Froude number in the range of 5&#8201;<&#8201;Fr&#8201;<&#8201;30). This value is smaller than the mixing efficiency in a typical turbulent mixing event (&#915;&#8201;~&#8201;0.17)33.\nDiapycnal eddy diffusivity\nThe diapycnal eddy diffusivity of density is defined as3133and quantifies the mixing due to vertical transport34. Kunze14 showed that K&#961; scales as (K&#961;/&#957;)&#8201;~&#8201;&#947;1Re2&#981;, where &#947;1(<1) is the correlation coefficient and &#981; is the volume fraction of the organisms in an aggregate. The eddy diffusivity obtained from the present simulations agrees well with Kunze&#8217;s scaling for Re&#8201;<&#8201;1 and &#946;&#8201;=&#8201;1 (blue line in Fig. 1b). The diapycnal eddy diffusivity for Re&#8201;&#8201;10 (Fig. 1b), pushers generate more effective mixing than pullers and the magnitude of diapycnal eddy diffusivity at Re&#8201;=&#8201;50 and &#946;&#8201;=&#8201;&#8722;5 exceeds that of the molecular diffusion. Noss and Lork35 experimentally evaluated the vertical mass flux generated by a freely swimming Daphina (Re&#8201;~&#8201;50, a&#8201;~&#8201;0.5&#8201;mm, U&#8201;~&#8201;1&#8201;cm&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;s&#8722;1, &#981;&#8201;~&#8201;1%) in a density stratified fluid, and showed its value to be about 0.8&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10&#8722;5&#8201;m2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;s&#8722;1 which is consistent with our numerical results for pushers swimming at Re&#8201;=&#8201;50. At Re&#8201;=&#8201;100 which resembles swimming of centimeter-sized organisms, the mixing is comparable to small scale turbulent mixing caused by internal wave breaking (10&#8722;5&#8201;m2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;s&#8722;1), a major contributor to the interior ocean mixing214.It would be illustrative to compare the values of diapycnal eddy diffusivity due to biogenic mixing to those generated by turbulent events. For shear turbulence in a stratified fluid, three distinctive regions can be identified based on the turbulent activity parameter &#949;/&#957;N234, the ratio of the destabilizing effect of turbulent stirring to the stabilizing effects originated from the combination of buoyancy and viscosity. Here, &#949;&#8201;=&#8201;2&#957;E&#8201;:&#8201;E. Strong mixing occurs for large values of &#949;/&#957;N2. Region I in Fig. 1c corresponds to the decaying turbulence in a stratified fluid for &#949;/&#957;N2&#8201;<&#8201;7; region II corresponds to the stationary turbulence which occurs when 7&#8201;<&#8201;&#949;/&#957;N2&#8201;&#8201;10034. Figure 1c shows that the majority of data points representing the biogenic mixing induced by squirmers lie above the scaling curve for the turbulent mixing. The dissipation generated by the squirmers in a stratified fluid corresponds to regions II and III. The mixing generated by the squirmers in local hot spots can generate eddy diffusivities as strong as turbulent mixing, but it occurs at larger values of energy dissipation compared to turbulent mixing.\nTemperature microstructure\nTo quantify the local temperature microstructure at thermocline, the Cox number3136 is used and is defined aswhere  is the mean temperature gradient. The Cox number provides a measure of the variance of the temperature gradient in the fluid. Gregg36 has reported the seasonal Cox number to be between 1 and 290 at North Pacific thermocline. For the mixing generated by the squirmers at an intermediate Reynolds number, the temperature microstructure is generated through the combination of the squirmer&#8217;s locomotion and the thermal diffusion of the fluid. The Cox number in a swarm of squirmers can be as large as O(100) (see Fig. 1d).\nEffect of swimming orientation\nUnless otherwise stated, the squirmers are initialized to swim in the vertical direction; however, their swimming orientation evolves over time due to their hydrodynamic interaction, collision as well as the background turbulence because they are modeled as force-free, torque-free swimmers. We have performed an additional simulation where the swimmers are constrained to swim in the vertical direction by applying an external torque. In this case, the mixing efficiency, diapycnal eddy diffusivity, and Cox number enhance for vertically swimming pushers (&#946;&#8201;=&#8201;&#8722;5, &#981;&#8201;=&#8201;4%, Re&#8201;=50, Fr&#8201;=&#8201;5.29) by a factor of 1.72, 1.88, and 3.00, respectively, compared to force-free, torque-free swimmers. The mixing efficiency, diapycnal eddy diffusivity, and Cox number enhance by a factor of 7.43, 7.98 and 8.26 for pullers (&#946;&#8201;=&#8201;5, &#981;&#8201;=&#8201;4%, Re&#8201;=50, Fr&#8201;=&#8201;5.29), respectively.The mixing induced by squirmers is sensitive to the initial swimming orientation &#945;, measured from the gravitational direction. For a regular array of squirmers, the ratio of mixing efficiency for vertically swimming cells (&#945;&#8201;=&#8201;0&#176;) to horizontally swimming cells (&#945;&#8201;=&#8201;90&#176;) increases with Reynolds number (see Fig. 2a). We should note that a regular array refers to a single squirmer in a periodic computational domain. Thus, the swimming orientation remains constant except for large enough Reynolds number (Re &#8805; 10) where inertial effects lead to instability in the swimming orientation of a puller. For Re&#8201;<&#8201;1, this ratio is below 10, which is close to the analytical results in a zero-Reynolds-number regime12. The distinction between values of both diapycnal eddy diffusivity and Cox number for vertically and horizontally swimming cells significantly increases with Reynolds number (see Fig. 2b,c).\nEffect of system size and volume fraction\nFor a given volume fraction, the effect of the system size has been tested for different number of squirmers, Ns&#8201;=&#8201;1, 8, 12, 27. The temporal evolution of the diapycnal eddy diffusivity K&#961; and Cox number are shown in Fig. 3a,b, where the dimensionless time is calculated as T&#8201;=&#8201;t&#957;/a2. The results are independent of the system size for Ns &#8805; 837. Unless otherwise stated, we use &#981;&#8201;=&#8201;4% and Ns&#8201;=&#8201;8.For a given system size, the effect of volume fraction has been evaluated by changing the number of squirmers in the computational domain. The mixing efficiency is almost independent of the volume fraction (Fig. 3c). Both the diapycnal eddy diffusivity and Cox number increase with the volume fraction (Fig. 3d,e).\nEffect of density stratification\nDensity stratification strongly affects the mixing efficiency generated by a suspension of squirmers in a stratified fluid. The mixing efficiency decreases with the Froude number (see Fig. 4a). For Re&#8201;=&#8201;10, the change of the mixing efficiency is about two orders of magnitude from Fr&#8201;=&#8201;3.6 to 52.9. On the other hand, the overall vertical mass flux and temperature microstructures are nearly independent of the density stratification for Fr&#8201;>&#8201;20. The values of diapycnal eddy diffusivity (Fig. 4b) and Cox number (Fig. 4c) slightly increase at small Fr (Fr&#8201;<&#8201;20). It has been noted by Ardekani and Stocker13 that the fundamental length scale of the stratification in aquatic environments is . When stratification length scale is larger than the swimmer size, i.e., L/a&#8201;~&#8201;1, the behavior is the same as the homogeneous-density fluid and is independent of stratification (L/a&#8201;~&#8201;1 corresponds to Fr&#8201;~&#8201;30). The local shear generated by swimming ctenophores is about U/a&#8201;~&#8201;0.5s&#8722;123, which corresponds to Fr&#8201;~&#8201;50 (N&#8201;~&#8201;0.01). Therefore, the vertical mass flux induced by organisms swimming across weak stratification is similar to the one in a homogenous fluid. On the contrary, the fluid stratification strongly reduces the turbulent mixing. The diapycnal eddy diffusivity of the turbulent mixing scales as &#949;/(&#957;N2) (see black circles in Fig. 1c). The dissipation of kinetic energy in a turbulent flow scales as &#949;&#8201;~&#8201;ut3/l where ut and l are the characteristic velocity and the integral length scale of the turbulence, respectively. Thus, the turbulent activity parameter can be written as . Consequently, turbulent mixing is suppressed in the region of strong vertical density gradient (e.g. pycnoclines), unlike mixing induced by swimming organisms.\nEffect of buoyancy\nHere, we consider the motion of negatively (&#961;p&#8201;>&#8201;&#961;0) and positively (&#961;p&#8201;<&#8201;&#961;0) buoyant swimming organisms. Figure 5 shows the role of buoyancy on the mixing efficiency, diapycnal eddy diffusivity and Cox number for Re&#8201;=&#8201;10, Fr&#8201;=&#8201;5.29, &#981;&#8201;=&#8201;4%, &#946;&#8201;=&#8201;&#8722;5. The squirmer&#8217;s buoyancy is characterized by b&#8201;=&#8201;(&#961;p&#8201;&#8722;&#8201;&#961;0)/&#961;0. The values of b&#8201;=&#8201;0.0067 and b&#8201;=&#8201;0.03 are selected based on the reported excess density for copepod relative to the ambient fluid which is in the range of 6.7&#8201;kg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;m&#8722;3 to 30&#8201;kg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;m&#8722;33839. Mixing parameters are enhanced for both positively and negatively buoyant swimmers compared to a neutrally buoyant case (b&#8201;=&#8201;0).\nEffect of marine turbulence\nTurbulent flows are prevalent in marine environments. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate how the organisms interact with the background turbulence40. We will show that the biogenic contribution to the total mixing is determined by the magnitude of dissipation of kinetic energy introduced by the organisms. Even though Gregg and Horne&#8217;s41 studies were designed to answer this question, isolation of the effects of the organisms&#8217; swimming from turbulence is difficult, if not impossible, in a natural environment. Direct numerical simulations performed here allow us to separately consider both effects of turbulence and flow disturbances generated by squirmers. We investigate the hydrodynamic interaction of a suspension of swimmers in a decaying stratified turbulence. The initial stratified turbulent flow is generated using direct numerical simulations with a direct forcing approach4243, the details of which have been elaborated in the &#8216;Methods&#8217; section. The Taylor Reynolds number for the turbulence is Re&#955;&#8201;=&#8201;urms&#955;/&#957;&#8201;~&#8201;49 and &#949;/(&#957;N2)&#8201;~&#8201;126, where urms is the root-mean-square of the turbulent velocity and &#955; is the Taylor length scale. The corresponding mixing parameters are calculated as K&#961;/&#957;&#8201;=&#8201;20.56&#8201;&#177;&#8201;4.82, COX&#8201;=&#8201;149.28&#8201;&#177;&#8201;29.87, and &#915;&#8201;=&#8201;0.139&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.027. The value of diapycnal eddy diffusivity agrees well with the curve suggested by Shih et al.34 (see hollow orange square in Fig. 1c). Gregg and Horne took modular microstructure profilers (MMPs) for measuring temperature and velocity microstructure within and outside aggregates of organisms41, and relevant mixing properties of our turbulence simulation are close to one of their MMPs (MMP15041) outside the aggregate (K&#961;&#8201;=&#8201;1.71&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10&#8722;5&#8201;m2/s, COX&#8201;=&#8201;120, &#915;&#8201;=&#8201;0.101). The squirmers&#8217; size is about a&#8201;~&#8201;1.07&#955; and a&#8201;~&#8201;14.69&#951;, where &#951; is the kolmogorov length scale. The squirmer Reynolds number is Re&#8201;=&#8201;Ua/&#957;&#8201;=&#8201;100, representing swimming of marine organisms of centimeter size and |&#946;|&#8201;=&#8201;3.To quantify the relative extent of the biogenic mixing (in the absence of background flow) with regards to the turbulent mixing, a &#8220;biomixing active parameter&#8221; is defined aswhere subscripts b and turb refer to biogenic mixing and turbulent mixing, respectively. The diapycnal eddy diffusivity can be expressed in terms of mixing efficiency &#915;, and equation (12) simplifies asFor biomixing, &#915;b&#8201;&#8810;&#8201;1941 and equation (15) is simplified as K&#961;&#8201;=&#8201;&#915;b&#949;b/(&#961;0N2). For general turbulent mixing in marine environments, &#915;turb&#8201;~&#8201;0.17 and K&#961;&#8201;~&#8201;0.2&#949;turb/(&#961;0N2)33. Therefore, biomixing active parameter can be expressed asIn our simulations, the temporal evolution of biomixing active parameter B is calculated for a suspension of squirmers, and its maximum value is about 0.9 (see Fig. 6d).The results reveal that pushers more strongly affect the overall mixing compared to pullers. For a decaying stratified turbulence without squirmers (black solid line in Fig. 6a), normalized K&#961;/&#957; is suppressed within two eddy turnover times, where Te&#8201;=&#8201;t/&#964;0 is the normalized time scale and &#964;0 is the initial eddy turnover time of the turbulence. With the entrainment of the squirmers of Taylor length-scale size, the dynamics of mixing can be characterized by two distinct stages. In stage I, the value of B for both pushers and pullers is above 0.2 (see Fig. 6d), due to the hydrodynamic interactions between the turbulence and the squirmers&#8217; disturbances. In stage II, the turbulent structure decays away and the flow that is induced by the squirmers is strong. During stage I when Te&#8201;<&#8201;2, pushers (blue solid line in Fig. 6a) significantly affect the mixing, while the pullers (red solid line in Fig. 6a) do not affect the mixing generated by the decaying turbulence. This is consistent with the results of squirmers in a quiescent flow where pushers (red dotted line in Fig. 6a) are able to generate larger mixing in a stratified fluid than pullers (blue dotted line in Fig. 6a). The dissipation of kinetic energy is also larger for pushers compared to pullers, where &#949;/&#949;0 in Fig. 6c is the normalized dissipation of kinetic energy and &#949;0 is the initial dissipation of the decaying turbulence. Similarly, pushers (blue solid line in Fig. 6b) strengthen temperature microstructures in a stratified decaying turbulence, as shown by the dramatic increase of the Cox number compared to the case corresponding to the decaying turbulence in the absence of swimmers (black solid line in Fig. 6b). During stage II, the fine structure of the turbulence decays away. Both the eddy diffusivity and Cox number decrease to their values for a suspension of squirmers in a quiescent flow.The strong mixing of fluids generated by pushers compared to pullers can be explained by their swimming trajectories. Pushers (Fig. 6g) rectilinearly swim with infrequent changes in their swimming direction due to the squirmer-squirmer interactions, while pullers (Fig. 6f) swim in helical pathes. Even though the slip velocity is axisymmetric for both pushers and pullers, pullers swim in helical trajectories due to their hydrodynamic interactions as well as inertial effects. Our previous results44 show that even a single puller at large enough Reynolds number becomes unstable and will not swim on a straight line due to inertial effects. This is not the case for a pusher in the range of Reynolds number investigated in this work. Our previous results for two squirmers moving toward each other in a relatively large computational domain44 shows that pullers move on circular trajectories after the collision, whereas swimming direction of a pusher does not change. Over a duration of 4Te, pushers are much more dispersed compared to pullers (see Fig. 6f and 6g). Consequently, pushers create larger disturbances in stratified fluids. The extent of biogenic mixing depends on the swimming mode of organisms during their migration.\nConclusions\nWe have numerically studied the hydrodynamic interactions of swimmers with each other, background stratification as well as turbulence. For swimming at Re&#8201;<&#8201;1, the diapycnal eddy diffusivity is generally below the value of molecular diffusion. Therefore, the biogenic mixing at low inertial regime is negligible. Our results show that the mixing efficiency, diapycnal eddy diffusivity, and temperature microstructure increase with inertia. The mixing efficiency induced by vertical swimming can be two orders of magnitude larger than horizontal swimming. Vigorous kinetic dissipation generated by a suspension of swimmers enhances the mass transport as well as the temperature microstructure in the presence of background turbulence. Pushers induce larger mixing compared to pullers, which is due to their rectilinear swimming behaviour as opposed to helical motion of pullers. The values of diapycnal eddy diffusivity and Cox number at Re~O(100) are on the same order as the ones caused by turbulent mixing.\nMethods\n\nModeling squirmers in a quiescent background flow\nThe simulations are conduced in a fixed frame of reference. Equations (3), (4), and (6) are solved in a cubic box of 2&#960;&#8201;&#215;&#8201;2&#960;&#8201;&#215;&#8201;2&#960;. The boundary conditions for u, p, and T&#8242; are periodic in all three directions. Convection and diffusion terms in Equation (4) are discretized using QUICK (Quadratic Upstream Interpolation for Convective Kinetics)45 and central difference schemes, respectively. Both convection and diffusion terms in equation (6) are solved using central difference schemes to conserve perturbation temperature T&#8242;2 in space. The temporal discretization is performed using the first-order forward Euler method. The projection method is utilized to enforce the continuity condition in equation (3). The resultant Poisson equation for the pressure is solved using the Hypre library46. The tangential squirming motion v&#952; on the surface of the spherical particle is satisfied by using a distributed Lagrange multiplier (DLM) technique as explained in our previous publication2947. The DLM technique has been broadly utilized to study a suspension of inert particles37 as well as squirmers1929. A short-range repulsive force is used to model squirmer-squirmer collision, the details of which are given in our previous work29.\nModeling background turbulence\nTurbulence ubiquitously occurs in marine environments. In order to study the hydrodynamic interactions between the turbulence and the disturbances induced by squirmers, a statistically steady stratified turbulence is numerically generated and treated as the initial background flow. Equations (3), (4), and (6) are solved. Instead of calculating the body force using the DLM technique, however, f is a direct forcing term which is given as . The initial temperature field linearly varies with depth. The initial velocity field is generated using an open source code (NTMIX-3D) provided by Centre de Recherche sur la Combustion Turbulente48. The initial velocity profile has the following energy spectrum E(k) suggested by Passot and Pouquet (1987)49,where k is the wave number, ke represents the most energetic wave number and . The stratified turbulence reaches a statistically stationary state as both  and &#949; reach a quasi-steady value43. Once the statistically stationary state is achieved, the direct forcing is no longer required and the stratified turbulence decays. The kolmogorov scale is well resolved in the simulations and &#951;kmax&#8201;=&#8201;5.23&#8201;>&#8201;1, where kmax&#8201;=&#8201;&#960;Ng/L, Ng&#8201;=&#8201;256 is the number of grid points, and L&#8201;=&#8201;2&#960; is the length of the computational domain.\nAdditional Information\nHow to cite this article: Wang, S. and Ardekani, A.

We have investigated whether species with different spur morphology had similar spur anatomy and nectary trichome structure.

The nectary spur has been of interest to researchers for a very long time; e.g. after analysing of the spur of orchid Angraecum sesquipedale, Darwin (1862) proposed the coevolution of the length of a nectar spur and its pollinator&#8217;s tongue. Nectary spur characters are strongly associated with a type of pollinator, and this organ has evolved multiple times across flowering plants (Hodges 1997). After a phylogenetic analysis of the pollination evolution syndrome in Aquilegia, Whittall and Hodges (2007) proposed a significant evolutionary trend for increasing the nectary spur length during directional shifts to pollinators with longer tongues. According to Box et al. (2011), spurs could have evolved in angiosperms by changes in regulatory KNOX gene expression. Changes in spur characters are the true evolutionary innovations underlying the rapid radiation of some genera or families including Lentibulariaceae (e.g., Hodges and Arnold 1995; Hodges 1997; Puzey et al. 2012).Most Utricularia species (Lentibulariaceae family) have well-developed spurs which are outgrowths of the lower corolla lip (Taylor 1989). However, in some species, the spur may be reduced in size compared to that of other corolla parts (as in U. dunlopii; P&#322;achno et al. 2016) or the spur region may be only shallowly saccate as in U. rigida Benj. and U. tetraloba P.Taylor (Taylor 1989). In contrast to other Utricularia species, Utricularia simmonsii Lowrie, Cowie & Conran, which is probably the smallest species in the genus, lacks a spur entirely (Lowrie et al. 2008).Observations of nectar production in Utricularia are scare. Hobbhahn et al. (2006) were the first to prove nectar production in three terrestrial Utricularia species belonging to the subgenus Bivalvaria and presented detailed data on nectar volumes and sugar concentrations. Vogel (pers. comm. in Hobbhahn et al. 2006) observed nectar in some South American Utricularia species. However, according to J&#233;r&#233;mie (1989), the autogamous Utricularia alpina does not produce nectar. In contrast, Abrahamczyk et al. (2017) not only recorded nectar in this species but also estimated nectar sugar concentrations. Nectar was recorded in the spurs of Utricularia reniformis A.St.Hil. (Clivati et al. 2014; Abrahamczyk et al. 2017), Utricularia nephrophylla Benj. (Abrahamczyk et al. 2017) and U. nelumbifolia (P&#322;achno et al. 2017b). Hobbhahn et al. (2006) pointed out that further research was needed to determine the frequency of nectar occurrence within the genus as well as the possible correlations of nectar production with the reproductive system.This study aimed to examine the structure of the flower nectary trichomes in four Utricularia species from the section Utricularia using light microscopy and scanning and transmission electron microscopy. We investigated whether species with different spur morphology have similar spur anatomy and nectary trichome structure. To proper understanding Utricularia flower function in relation to its morphology and nectar secretion, additionally, we investigated flower visitors and potential pollinators.\nMaterial and methods\n\nPlant material\nThe species used in this study included Utricularia vulgaris L., U. bremii Heer, U. australis R.Br. and U. foliosa L. Utricularia vulgaris was kept in the collection of aquatic carnivorous plants in the Institute of Botany of the Czech Academy of Sciences at T&#345;ebo&#328;, S Bohemia, Czech Republic. Cultivation conditions are detailed by Adamec and Poppinga (2016). Open flowers were observed in outdoor conditions in order to record flower visitors or pollinators during various seasons (2012, 2017). The insects were photographed using a Nikon D810 and an Olympus SP-510UZ digital camera. Trapped insects were analysed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to check if U. vulgaris pollen grains occurred on insect surfaces.Flowers of U. bremii were collected from a shallow sand-pit Cep I in Suchdol nad Lu&#382;nic&#237;, S Bohemia, Czech Republic, in 2016 and 2017. Flowers of U. australis were collected from populations in Silesia, Poland, in 2010 and also from the shallow sand-pit Cep I in Suchdol nad Lu&#382;nic&#237; in 2016 and 2017. Flowers of U. australis originating from N.S.W, Australia, were taken from the collection of the Institute of Botany at T&#345;ebo&#328;. Utricularia foliosa flowers were collected from a natural site in Mogi das Cruzes Municipality, S&#227;o Paulo State, Brazil. The herbarium voucher is deposited at the JABU Herbarium (Universidade Estadual Paulista UNESP/ FCAV). Plants with flowers were observed under field conditions to record flower visitors or pollinators during all the seasons (January to December) and at least in 2&#160;months of a season. The insects were photographed using a camera Sony Cyber-shot DSC-HX1. Trapped insects were again analysed using SEM to check whether Utricularia pollen grains were present.\nFloral structure and histochemical investigations\nThe distribution of the secretory glandular trichomes was determined by examining whole flowers (corollas) using a Nikon SZ100 stereoscopic microscope. Floral parts, namely the spurs, were examined using light microscopy (LM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) as follows. Firstly, the tissue of the spurs was examined during anthesis (in U. vulgaris also in young closed flowers). Pieces of the floral tissues (spurs) were excised and fixed in a mixture of 2.5% glutaraldehyde with 2.5% formaldehyde in a 0.05&#160;M cacodylate buffer (Sigma; pH&#160;7.2) overnight or for several days, washed three times in a 0.1&#160;M sodium cacodylate buffer and post-fixed in a 1% osmium tetroxide solution at room temperature for 1.5&#160;h. Dehydration using a graded ethanol series, infiltration and embedding using an epoxy embedding medium kit (Fluka) followed. Following polymerisation at 60&#160;&#176;C, sections were cut at 70&#160;nm for TEM using a Leica ultracut UCT ultramicrotome, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate (Reynolds 1963) and examined using a Hitachi H500 transmission electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 75&#160;kV.Semi-thin sections (0.9&#8211;1.0&#160;&#956;m thick) were prepared for LM and stained for general histology using aqueous methylene blue/azure II (MB/AII) for 1&#8211;2&#160;min (Humphrey and Pittman 1974) and examined with an Olympus BX60 light microscope. Some material for semi-thin sections was fixed in ethanol/acetic acid (3:1 v/v). For each species (U. vulgaris, U. bremii), the 10 trichomes were measured. The mean values for trichomes of these species were given in the &#8220;Results&#8221; section.For SEM, the representative floral parts were fixed (as above or in ethanol/acetic acid 3:1 v/v) and later dehydrated and subjected to critical-point drying using liquid CO2. They were then sputter-coated with gold and examined at an accelerating voltage of 20&#160;kV using a Hitachi S-4700 scanning electron microscope (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan), which is housed in the Institute of Geological Sciences, Jagiellonian University in Krak&#243;w).\nResults\n\nNone\n\nGeneral flower morphology and nectary trichome structure\nThe corolla of U. vulgaris was yellow with reddish-brown nectar marks on the palate. The lower corolla lip formed a platform, but its margins were U-shaped deflexed. The lower lip was not firmly appressed to the upper lip, there was a slit and generative structures were visible (Fig.&#160;1a). The spur was oriented directly downwards from the lower corolla lip at an acute angle. Nectar was observed inside the spur, forming micro-droplets (Fig. 1b). Nectar trichomes occurred on the internal abaxial side of the spur (Fig. 1c), and nectary stomata were absent.Fig. 1General floral morphology of Utricularia vulgaris. a Floral morphology of U. vulgaris from the collection of aquatic carnivorous plants in the Institute of Botany at T&#345;ebo&#328;&#8212;visible generative structures (arrow). b Opened spur, nectar forms micro-droplets. c Section through the spur; nectar trichomes (star); bar&#8201;=&#8201;1&#160;mmFig. 2Morphology and anatomy of Utricularia vulgaris spur. a Part of the section through the spur with glandular trichomes and papillae; bar&#8201;=&#8201;100&#160;&#956;m. b General structure of the glandular trichome; note that the head cells of the trichomes stain intensely with MB/AII: terminal&#8201;=&#8201;head cells (H), pedestal cell (Pc), basal cell (Bc), parenchyma cell (Pa), intercellular spaces (star); bar&#8201;=&#8201;20&#160;&#956;m. c Part of the section through the spur showing vascular bundle: xylem elements (x), phloem (Ph); bar&#8201;=&#8201;20&#160;&#956;m. d, e Trichomes with two-celled stalk consisting of the basal cell and the additional cell (Ad), pedestal cell (white arrow) and separated cuticle from the head cells (black arrow); bar&#8201;=&#8201;50&#160;&#956;m (d) and 20&#160;&#956;m (e). f Part of longitudinal section through basal cell and pedestal cell (Pc), note numerous plasmodesmata (arrows) between these cells; thickened impregnated anticlinal wall of a pedestal cell (star); bar&#8201;=&#8201;1.15&#160;&#956;mFig. 3Ultrastructure of a glandular trichome from the spur of Utricularia vulgaris. a Ultrastructure of pedestal (Pc) and terminal cells (Hc); note the well-developed labyrinth wall (arrows) in the pedestal cell, plastids (P), mitochondria (m), endoplasmic reticulum (Er), nucleus (N); bar&#8201;=&#8201;1.2&#160;&#956;m. b Ultrastructure of terminal cells; note the paracrystalline protein inclusion (star) in the nucleus (N), dense cytoplasm with numerous plastids, mitochondria (m).

The parenchyma cells were non-glandular. Relatively large intercellular spaces occurred between the parenchyma cells. The parenchyma cells had numerous plastids with large starch grains. Collateral vascular bundles occurred in the ground parenchyma (Fig. 2c), each containing both xylem and phloem elements. Internal epidermis formed papillae, which were unicellular with a smooth surface (Fig. 2d). They were highly vacuolated and had numerous plastids in their cytoplasm.Glandular spur trichomes were composed of a single basal cell which formed a unicellular stalk (length 21&#160;&#956;m), pedestal cell (barrier cell, mean length&#8201;=&#8201;17&#160;&#956;m, n&#8201;=&#8201;10) (Fig. 2b) and a multi-celled head (mean length&#8201;=&#8201;21&#160;&#956;m, n&#8201;=&#8201;10, mean diameter&#8201;=&#8201;47&#160;&#956;m, n&#8201;=&#8201;10; Figs.&#160;2b and 3a). However, part of the trichomes had a two-celled stalk, which consisted of a basal cell and an additional cell (Fig. 2d, e). The pedestal cell and the head cells were different in vacuolisation and the degree of cytoplasm density from the stalk cells (Fig. 2b, e).The basal cell was highly vacuolated and most of the cytoplasm with the usual organelles was located in the upper part of the cell near the pedestal cell or the additional stalk cell. The nucleus of the basal cell was surrounded by numerous plastids. The lateral wall of the basal cell developed a cuticle in the place where it was not connected with other cells. Similarly, the lateral wall of the additional stalk cell developed a distinct cuticle. The additional stalk cell was more or less cylindrically shaped. Numerous plasmodesmata occurred in the transverse walls between the stalk cell and the pedestal cell as well as between the additional stalk cell and the pedestal cell (Fig. 2f). The pedestal cell had a thick radial wall, which was impregnated with cutin (Figs. 2f and 3a). Most of the cytoplasm, with the nucleus and the usual organelles (mitochondria, plastids, and endoplasmic reticulum), were located in the upper part of the cell near the head cells (Fig.&#160;3a). Numerous plasmodesmata occurred in the transverse walls between the pedestal cell and the terminal cells. The protoplasts of the head cells were electron-dense and had a prominent nucleus containing a paracrystalline protein inclusion (Fig. 3b). The cell wall ingrowths arose from the inner surface of the outer cell walls (Fig. 3b) as well as from the inner walls between the head cells. Plastids were numerous and were dumbbell- or cube-shaped (Fig. 3a) There were also multivesicular bodies (MVBs) present. Flocculent electron-dense material was present in the vacuoles (Fig. 3b). Mitochondria with well-developed cristae and profiles of rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) were common in the cytoplasm of the head cells. Dictyosomes were small and not hypertrophied. The thick cuticle (Fig. 3b) frequently became distended and separated from the cell walls of the head cells on the apex of the head (Fig. 2e). Small cuticle pores together with micro-droplets of secretions were observed (Fig. 3c).\nFloral visitors and pollinators\nFlowers of Utricularia vulgaris were visited by females of a Common Drone Fly Eristalis tenax (Linnaeus, 1758); family Syrphidae (Fig.&#160;4a&#8211;c) and a small bee Lasioglossum sp.; family Halictidae (Fig.&#160;5a, b). Inside the flowers, undetermined members of Thysanoptera were observed. Aphids (Rhopalosiphum nymphaeae L.) occurred mainly on the external parts of inflorescences, and sometimes, aphids also were seen in the flowers (not shown).A specimen of the large fly Eristalis tenax used the lower lip as a landing platform and later forced open the two corolla lobes. It entered the corolla tube with the front of its body and fed on the nectar in the spur. During this process, the fly was holding its leg on the expanded-swollen part of the lower lip (limb&#8212;the term sensu Taylor 1989, a part of palate sensu us) (Fig. 4a). SEM analysis revealed that Utricularia vulgaris pollen grains occurred on the surface of the Eristalis head and thorax&#8212;both on the lateral parts as well as on the insect&#8217;s back (Fig. 4d, e). Eristalis tenax cleaned its surface after penetrating the flower (Fig. 4c). The Lasioglossum bee penetrated the palate (Fig. 5a), studied the surface of the palate using antennae (Fig. 5a) and later penetrated the corolla tube (Fig. 5b). In contrast to Eristalis tenax, Lasioglossum was not using its strength to penetrate the flower and also did not deform the corolla shape during the visit. Under SEM, we did not observe U. vulgaris pollen grains on the surface of the Lasioglossum head and thorax.\nNone\nThe corolla of U. australis was yellow with reddish-brown nectar marks on the prominent palate (Fig. 6a). In the transverse section, the wall of the spur was composed of several cell layers: internal epidermis, a few layers of parenchyma cells and outer epidermis (Fig. 6b). The parenchyma cells were non-glandular. Very large intercellular spaces occurred between the parenchyma cells (Fig. 6b). Two collateral vascular bundles occurred in the parenchyma, each containing both xylem and phloem elements (not shown). Nectar trichomes occurred on both the abaxial and adaxial spur side (Fig. 6c). These glandular trichomes were composed of a single basal cell which formed the unicellular stalk, the pedestal cell (barrier cell) and a multi-celled head (Fig. 6b). However, part of the trichomes had the two- or three-celled stalk, which consisted of a basal cell and one or two additional cells (Fig. 6d). Epidermal cells sometimes formed a pedestal for the trichome (Fig. 6d). The inner epidermis formed short unicellular papillae with a smooth surface (Fig. 6d). They were highly vacuolated, not glandular.Fig. 6General floral morphology and spur structure of Utricularia australis. a Floral morphology of U. australis (Australian population) from the collection of aquatic carnivorous plants in the Institute of Botany at T&#345;ebo&#328;: spur (arrow). b Part of the section through the spur with glandular trichomes and papillae: pedestal cell (arrow), basal cell (Bc), papilla (p), parenchyma cell (pa), intercellular spaces (star), external epidermis (ep); bar&#8201;=&#8201;20&#160;&#956;m. c Nectar trichome distribution inside the spur; bar&#8201;=&#8201;1&#160;mm. d Morphology of nectar trichomes and papillae; note that one trichome had a three-celled stalk; additional cell (arrow), swollen cuticle of the head cells (star); bar&#8201;=&#8201;50&#160;&#956;m\nNone\nThe spur was shortly conical. In the lateral view, it was about as wide as long. Glandular trichomes densely covered the internal ventral spur surface (Fig. 7a, b). There was glandular continuity between the palate and the spur (Fig. 7a). In the transverse section, the wall of the spur was composed of several cell layers: the internal epidermis, a few layers of parenchyma cells and the outer epidermis (Fig. 7c). The parenchyma cells were highly vacuolated and non-glandular. Intercellular spaces occurred between the parenchyma cells. The parenchyma cells contained numerous plastids with large starch grains. Collateral vascular bundles occurred in the ground parenchyma (Fig. 7c, d), and each contained both xylem and phloem elements. The inner epidermis formed short unicellular papillae with striations on the surface (Fig. 7b). The papillae had rounded tips. They were highly vacuolated and contained plastids with starch.Fig. 7General morphology and anatomy of Utricularia bremii spur. a General morphology of the lower corolla lip: palate (P), throat spur (S); bar&#8201;=&#8201;1&#160;mm. b Morphology of nectar spur trichomes and papillae; bar&#8201;=&#8201;30&#160;&#956;m. c General anatomy of the spur: vascular bundle (Vb); bar&#8201;=&#8201;50&#160;&#956;m. d Part of the section through the spur showing structure of trichome and vascular bundle: separated cuticle from the head cells (black arrow), pedestal cell (Pc), basal cell (Bc), xylem elements (x), phloem (Ph); bar&#8201;=&#8201;20&#160;&#956;m. e, f Ultrastructure of head cells; note the paracrystalline protein inclusion (star) in the nucleus (N), dense cytoplasm with mitochondria (m).

The basal cell was highly vacuolated, and the lateral wall of this cell lay partly embedded in the epidermis. Its outer part, which formed a short &#8220;stalk&#8221;, created a well-developed cuticle that was continuous with that of the epidermal cells and the cuticular deposits of the pedestal cell. The head cells were transfer cells. Cell wall ingrowths (reticulate type) occurred on the inner surface of the outer wall of the terminal (head) cells, but also on the inner walls between the terminal cells (Fig. 7e, f). The cytoplasm of the head cells of the glandular trichomes stained deeply with methylene blue/azure II (Fig. 7d). The protoplasts of the head cells were electron-dense and had a prominent nucleus containing a paracrystalline protein inclusion. Their vacuole contained myelin-like figures and flocculent electron-dense material (Fig. 7e, f). Plastids were common and contained an electron-dense stroma; some of them were cube- or amoeboid-shaped (Fig. 7e). Mitochondria with well-developed cristae (Fig. 7f) and profiles of rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) occurred in the cytoplasm. The thick cuticle frequently became distended and separated from the cell walls of the head cells, especially in the apical part of the cells in response to the subcuticular accumulation of the nectar.\nNone\nThe spur was narrowly conical, nearly parallel with the lower lip (Fig.&#160;8a). Nectariferous trichomes occurred mainly in two patches (Fig. 8b). Trichomes were also rarely scattered on the opposite spur surface. In the transverse section, the spur wall was composed of several cell layers: the internal epidermis, a few layers of parenchyma cells and the outer epidermis (Fig. 8c, d). The parenchyma cells were highly vacuolated and non-glandular. Intercellular spaces occurred between the parenchyma cells. Six collateral vascular bundles were found in the parenchyma. Groups of glandular trichomes occurred between the places where vascular bundles were localised (Fig. 8c), but they were sometimes found above the vascular bundle (Fig. 8e). The sessile glandular spur trichomes were composed of a single basal cell, a unicellular short pedestal cell (barrier cell with a thick radial wall impregnated with cutin) and a multi-celled head. The head cells were transfer cells (not shown). The inner spur epidermis formed conical papillae with cuticular striations (Fig. 8f).Fig. 8General floral morphology and spur structure of Utricularia foliosa. a Floral morphology of U. foliosa: spur (arrow). b Nectar trichome distribution inside the spur; bar&#8201;=&#8201;500&#160;&#956;m. c General anatomy of the spur: vascular bundle (Vb); bar&#8201;=&#8201;100&#160;&#956;m. d Part of the section through the spur showing structure of trichome: pedestal cell (Pc), basal cell (Bc); bar&#8201;=&#8201;20&#160;&#956;m. e Occurrence of a nectar trichome near the vascular bundle; bar&#8201;=&#8201;10&#160;&#956;m. f Morphology of nectar trichomes and papillae; bar&#8201;=&#8201;50&#160;&#956;mFig. 9Pollination of Utricularia foliosa. a&#8211;c Behaviour of bees on U. foliosa flowers; note pollen grains on the bee thorax. (Credit of images: Dasmili&#225; Cruz)\nFloral visitors and pollinators\nUtricularia foliosa flowers were visited by two species of small Halictidae bees (Fig.&#160;9a&#8211;c) which penetrated the palate and the corolla tube (Fig. 9b). Utricularia pollen grains were visible on the surface of the bee thorax (Fig. 9a).\nDiscussion\nSpur trichomes of Utricularia have been analysed for a long time&#8212;mainly for the potential taxonomic use (e.g. Farooq 1963; Farooq and Siddiqui 1966; Thor 1988; Taylor 1989). To date, however, no data have been published on the ultrastructure of spur nectary trichomes of Utricularia. All species examined here had the capitate trichome type with the single-barrier cell in the spur. The interspecific differences included the stalk length (these trichomes were sessile in U. foliosa, in U. bremii nearly sessile in contrast to well-stalked trichomes in U. vulgaris and U. australis) and the occurrence of the additional cell or cells in the stalk (U. vulgaris, U. australis). P&#322;achno et al. (2017b) suggested that the general structure of the nectar-secreting trichomes in the genus Utricularia were very conservative in evolutionary terms, and results obtained here also corroborate this hypothesis. In all examined species in this study, the spur epidermis completely lacked nectary stomata and papillae were not glandular, either. Thus, the only source of nectar is the glandular capitate trichomes. Trichome head cells have ultrastructure typical for nectary glandular cells (see e.g. Fahn 1979a, b; Durkee 1983; Razem and Davis 1999; Wist and Davis 2006; Nepi 2007). However, it should be underlined that the most published observations were performed on the non-trichome nectarines, and data about trichome nectary ultrastructure are scarce and based on a few taxa only (Lonicera&#8212;Fahn and Rachmilevitz 1970; Abutilon&#8212;Robards and Stark 1988; Hibiscus&#8212;Sawidis et al. 1987, 1989; Platanthera&#8212;Stpiczy&#324;ska et al. 2005; Cyclanthera&#8212;Nepi 2007; Adenocalymma&#8212;Gama et al. 2016). In nectar-secreting trichromes, e.g. in Abutilon or Hibiscus, granulocrine secretion type was suggested (Kronestedt-Robards et al. 1986; Sawidis et al. 1987, 1989; Robards and Stark 1988; Kronestedt-Robards and Robards 1991). In head cells, we observed neither a &#8220;secretory reticulum&#8221; nor a hypertrophied Golgi apparatus. Moreover, the occurrence of cell wall ingrowths in the head cells may be evidence that the nectar is transported via an eccrinous mode of secretion (see L&#252;ttge 1971; Nepi 2007).The ultrastructural characters of the examined trichomes are very similar when compared with the scent glands from the palate of U. bremii (P&#322;achno et al. 2017a) and the corolla appendages of U. dunlopii (P&#322;achno et al. 2016). In all Utricularia species examined here, the nectary trichome had a barrier cell (pedestal cell) with a thick radial wall, which was impregnated with a lipophilic material. The endoderm-like element is typical for extranuptial nectaries devoid of stomata (see Paiva 2017 and literature therein). According to Cardoso-Gustavson and Davis (2015), cells impregnated with lipophilic compounds in the anticlinal walls not only act as a barrier to reduce an apoplastic route of outflow, but also control the inflow from the extracellular environment into actively secreting nectary tissues in floral trichome nectaries. However, it should be added that the barrier cell is the common character of various secretory trichomes of Lentibulariaceae (e.g. Fineran and Lee 1975; Fineran and Gilbertson 1980; Fineran 1985; P&#322;achno et al. 2007, 2017a).Based on our anatomical and ultrastructural observations and recent knowledge of the functioning of the nectaries (for details see Nepi 2007), we propose a way of nectar formation and secretion in Utricularia. Carbohydrates produced in tissues other than the spur are transported via vascular bundles to the spur parenchyma and epidermis cells and stored as starch. After starch hydrolysis, this pre-nectar is transported via the apoplast and the symplast from parenchyma and epidermis cells to the basal cell of the trichome. If there is an additional cell, this cell mediates the transport between the basal and barrier cells. The pre-nectar is transported between the basal and pedestal cell only via symplast as the radial wall of the barrier cell is impregnated and acts as a hydrophobic barrier. Also, the pre-nectar has to be transported only via symplast from the pedestal cell to the head cells. The pre-nectar is then transformed into nectar in the head cells. As these cells are transfer cells, the nectar secretion should be eccrine. Then, the nectar is accumulated in the subcuticular space and released via cuticle pores.Even though the spur of U. bremii had a different size and shape (see Taylor 1989) from the other examined species of the same Utricularia section, the general anatomy of the spur was the same. However, there were some differences between species in the internal spur epidermis microsculpture, which may relate to specialisation for insect visitors/pollinators. All examined species were different from each other in the nectary trichome distribution at the spur surface: U. vulgaris (on the internal abaxial side of the spur), U. australis (on both the abaxial and adaxial side), U. bremii (on the internal abaxial side) and U. foliosa (in two oblong patches; Thor 1988; Taylor 1989 and our observations). The close localisation of the nectar trichomes near the vascular bundles in U. foliosa is probably due to shortening the route of sugar transport from the phloem to the nectary tissue or to an increased water demand for the nectar production. A similar connection between nectar trichome localisation and vascular tissue was recorded in the U. nelumbifolia spur, where the trichome distribution in some parts of the spur coincided with the position of the vascular bundles (P&#322;achno et al. 2017b: Fig.&#160;12A). According to Silva et al. (2018), the generic section Utricularia is subdivided into two major clades, one formed by U. floridana, U. gibba and U. striata (clade I) and the other one (clade II) by the remaining species including those analysed here. However, U. foliosa is phylogenetically the most distant species within clade II, nesting outside the core of the section Utricularia. Utricularia vulgaris is most related with U. australis, and this fact is also reflected in the nectar trichome structure.We found that the examined species differed in the micromorphology of papillae in the spurs. Papillae with striations occurred in U. bremii and U. foliosa, whereas only smooth papillae were observed in U. australis and U. vulgaris. Also, U. bremii had papillae with rounded tips in contrast to other species. Unfortunately, there is only scarce literature information on the micromorphology of papillae in Utricularia spurs; papillae with striations were recorded in U. dunlopii and U. dichotoma (section Pleiochasia; P&#322;achno et al. 2016), U. reniformis (Clivati et al. 2014), U. nelumbifolia and U. cornigera (P&#322;achno et al. 2017b; formerly sect. Iperua, now included in sect. Orchidioides, see Rodrigues et al. 2017). Thus, it is difficult to draw any evolutionary conclusions. Various papillae sizes and surface morphology (with smooth surface versus papillae with striations) may provide &#8220;tactile information&#8221; for particular pollinators. According to Kevan and Lane (1985), honeybees are able to detect, learn and discriminate between the microsculptured epidermis of flower petals. The microsculptural patterns can be used as nectar guides by foraging insects. Bell et al. (2009) proposed that the occurrence of papillae in spurs of deceit-pollinated orchids may improve pollination because papillae satisfy the tactile expectation of pollinating insects. The occurrence of papillae in Utricularia spurs may also have another explanation. Papillae form a hydrophobic surface and so, plants may produce less nectar. This explanation is in an agreement with the observation of Hobbhahn et al. (2006) who recorded extremely small volumes of nectar in spurs of some terrestrial Utricularia species. These authors also observed that nectar did not accumulate in the tip of the spur but adhered in small droplets to the inner spur walls. We have made a similar observation in U. vulgaris. Thus, these micro-droplets are formed on a single trichome head or a group of trichomes. However, Clivati et al. (2014) observed that in the U. reniformis spur, nectar occurred as droplets but it also reached down to the spur tip.Taylor (1989) mentioned Hymenoptera, Diptera, Lepidoptera and hummingbirds as visitors to Utricularia flowers. Hobbhahn et al. (2006) observed that more than 50 species of bees, butterflies, moths, hawk moths and dipterans visited and pollinated the flowers of three terrestrial Utricularia species belonging to the subgenus Bivalvaria.Even though Utricularia vulgaris is not only far-ranging but also one out of the best known Utricularia species, the literature is lacking both pollination biology studies and reports of pollinator observations. In general, observations of pollinators or flower visitors of Utricularia species from the section Utricularia are scarce. Araki and Kadono (2003) mentioned that Japanese Utricularia australis (probably this was U. tenuicaulis Miki) was pollinated &#8220;by small insects, such as aphids or small dipterous species&#8221;. However, these authors did not add any details or documentations, which might prove that these insects were pollinators. An aphid Rhopalosiphum nymphaeae was recorded as a pest on Utricularia spp. by various authors (see e.g. Center et al. 1999), but we have observed that aphids mainly occupy external parts of inflorescence. Honda (2007) observed that flowers of Utricularia macrorhiza (closely related to U. vulgaris) were visited and pollinated by a member of the Syrphidae family, which was determined as Helophilus intentus (see http://pollinator.org/shop/poster-15). Helophilus behaviour on the U. macrorhiza flower reminds that instead one of Eristalis tenax on U. vulgaris flowers. Westerkamp and Classen-Bockhoff (2007) and later also Clivati et al. (2014) classified Utricularia as having gullet-shaped flowers. In this type of flower, reproductive structures are located in the upper side of the corolla and, consequently, the pollen grains become attached to the pollinator&#8217;s back&#8212;nototribic transfer (Faegri and van der Pijl 1971). We documented the nototribic transfer in U. vulgaris because we found Utricularia pollen grains at the Eristalis back. However, pollen grains were also found at other insect parts (e.g. near eyes) and this is due to that the fly cleaned its body surface after penetrating the flower.Salmon (2001) mentioned small honey bees as pollinators of Utricularia gibba L., however, without any details on the pollination biology. P&#322;achno et al. (2017a) observed that small Hymenoptera (members of families Mymaridae and Braconidae) were flower visitors of U. bremii. They suggested that these Hymenoptera might also be pollinators of U. minor, which has a similar size and flower structure to those of U. bremii.Both U. vulgaris and U. foliosa flowers were visited by small Halictidae bees. As we did not observe U. vulgaris pollen grains on the surface of the Lasioglossum bee head and thorax, we propose that this bee is only a flower visitor in contrast with the true pollinator Eristalis tenax fly. However, in U. foliosa, the small Halictidae bees seem to be pollinators of this species.\nConclusions\nNectar in Utricularia flowers is produced by capitate spur trichomes and despite the various spur morphology, the trichomes have similar architecture and ultrastructure.

Introduction\nA substantial proportion of people show increased susceptibility to foodborne illness compared with healthy adults. This susceptibility can result from chronic or acute illness, medication and/or age. The extent of this increased susceptibility differs according to the cause. In order to protect vulnerable people, who may be in hospitals, care homes or in the community, safeguards are needed in the production and supply of meals, and advice should be publicised to vulnerable people on the avoidance of certain foods.\n2. Importance and Main Hazards of Foodborne Disease\nIn the United States it is estimated that each year major pathogens cause over 9 million cases of domestically acquired foodborne illness, over 55,000 hospitalizations and over 1000 deaths [1].The estimated greatest numbers of cases of foodborne disease in the USA due to known pathogens in 2011 were caused by Norovirus, Salmonella spp., Clostridium perfringens, Campylobacter spp., and Staphylococcus aureus, but the greatest numbers of deaths were caused by Salmonella, Toxoplasma gondii, Listeria monocytogenes, Norovirus and Campylobacter [1] (Table 1).Estimates in Canada showed that norovirus, C. perfringens, Campylobacter spp. and non-typhoidal Salmonella accounted for 90% of the pathogen-specific, total cases of foodborne disease [2].In the UK the estimated number of cases and hospitalizations associated with major foodborne pathogens in 2009 [3] are shown in Table 2.In the EU in 2013 the majority of reported cases of gastrointestinal disease were associated with Campylobacter spp., but the greatest number of deaths were caused by L. monocytogenes, with a case-fatality rate of 15.6% [5] (Table 3). The importance of norovirus as the cause of foodborne disease in the EU is illustrated by the report that the largest reported foodborne outbreak in the EU in 2012 was a norovirus outbreak in which 10,950 people were affected [6].The higher hospitalization rates in Table 3 than in Table 1 and Table 2 occur because the cases in Table 3 are reported, confirmed cases, whereas those in Table 1 and Table 2 are estimates, allowing for underreporting of cases which would include many cases that were not hospitalized.In the Netherlands T. gondii and Campylobacter spp. were assessed as the foodborne pathogens with the highest disease burden, in terms of Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), on a population basis, while the burden per case was highest for perinatal listeriosis and congenital toxoplasmosis [7].According to these reports, major foodborne pathogens in these countries include, Campylobacter spp., Salmonella spp., Norovirus, C. perfringens, shiga-toxin-producing E. coli (STEC, E. coli O157 and similar bacteria), L. monocytogenes and T. gondii. The last 2 organisms are particularly important because of their high case-fatality rate. The effects of other foodborne pathogens on vulnerable people have been discussed previously [8,9,10]. For the majority of foodborne pathogens serious disease and deaths are associated particularly with vulnerable populations and people with underlying disease [3].\n3. Groups of Vulnerable People\nPeople who are particularly susceptible to foodborne disease include the very young, the elderly, and the immune compromised. These people may form nearly 20% of the population in the United States and the United Kingdom [8].Factors that lead to increased susceptibility are shown in Table 4 and discussed by Acheson [11]. Solid organ transplant patients are particularly susceptible to infections [12].The extent to which vulnerability is increased differs greatly between these groups. An estimate of the relative susceptibility of groups to listeriosis, based on incidence in France has been published [13] (Table 5.). Goulet et al. [14] estimated that patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia were the most vulnerable to listeriosis, with an incidence more than 1000 times greater than that in the population with no risk factors, and listed 14 underlying conditions associated with greater than 100-fold increase in susceptibility.Vulnerable groups may show a similar range of susceptibility to other pathogens.The number of susceptible people will increase with the increase in number of elderly people, many of whom are affected by chronic illnesses, and also with the increasing sophistication of treatments. Many people with increased susceptibility to foodborne disease will be in hospitals, nursing or residential homes. Others will be living in their own homes, and with increasing emphasis on movement of care from hospitals to the community (care in the community) the number of susceptible people in the community is likely to increase.\n4. Main Foods Associated with Hazards\nBased on estimated disease burden, in terms of Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QUALYs), the top 50 pathogen-food combinations in the USA were ranked by Batz et al. [15], the top 14 of which are shown in Table 6. An estimate of the main pathogen-food combinations, based on studies in the literature [3], is shown in Table 7.While foods of animal origin are associated with the major proportion of cases of foodborne illness, foods of non-animal origin are also associated with many outbreaks and cases. Studies in the US and the EU have identified top-ranking risk groups of non-animal foods as E. coli O157:H7 and leafy greens, Salmonella enterica and tomatoes, S. enterica and leafy greens, S. enterica and melons, and pathogenic E. coli and fresh pods, legumes and grains [16,17].Information from outbreaks and from sporadic cases shows that foods likely to pose a risk of causing foodborne infection, include ready-to-eat foods (i.e., foods intended for consumption without further preparation or heating), that are produced or processed in such a way that does not kill pathogens.\n5. Main Factors Leading to Foodborne Disease\nMain factors leading to foodborne disease include: food from unsafe sources; inadequate cooking; improper holding temperatures, contaminated equipment and cross-contamination and poor personal hygiene.In the light of these factors, foods that are of particular concern to vulnerable people have been outlined [9]. Examples of outbreaks that have resulted from these factors are shown in Table 8.Outbreaks of toxoplasmosis are rarely reported, as immune competent people infected usually show mild or no symptoms. A range of outbreaks were described by Smith [18], of 17 outbreaks 13 were associated with consumption of raw or rare meat or raw goat&#8217;s milk. Several outbreaks have been associated with drinking water [19].\n6. Prevention of Foodborne Disease in Vulnerable People\n\n6.1. Control of Food Provision\nThe EU regulation on the hygiene of foodstuffs [20] and Food Hygiene (England) Regulations 2006 and similar regulations in Scotland and Wales, include a requirement that food business operators should put in place, implement and maintain a permanent procedure or procedures based on hazard analysis and critical control point principles (HACCP) [21].This applies to meals supplied in hospitals and institutions as well as other food businesses. In order for a HACCP system to be effective, prerequisite programs must be in place to control factors such as Good Manufacturing Practice, raw material control, production control, pest control, sanitation and maintenance, use of approved suppliers and supplier auditing schemes.It is particularly important that food for vulnerable groups of people is obtained from reputable suppliers who comply with legal requirements, have in place an appropriate food safety management system based on HACCP principles, and use safe food-handling techniques.\n6.2. Avoid Food from Unsafe Sources\nAvoidance of food from unsafe sources is particularly important in the case of foods that will not receive further processing, such as cooking, before consumption. Such foods include raw or unpasteurized milk, soft or mould-ripened cheese made with unpasteurized milk, unpasteurized fruit and vegetable juices, raw salad vegetables and fruit, shellfish harvested from unclassified areas, raw vegetable sprouts.\n6.3. Ensure Adequate Cooking\nConditions advised for cooking foods (Table 9) are based on a requirement to inactivate vegetative foodborne bacterial pathogens, including Campylobacter spp., STEC, Salmonella spp. and L. monocytogenes, the most heat-resistant of this group.\n6.4. Ensure Control of Holding Temperature\nClostridium perfringens forms spores that are heat-resistant and are not inactivated by cooking. Meals, particularly meat dishes, that are not eaten immediately but are prepared in advance, should be cooled within two hours from 57 &#176;C to 21 &#176;C and within 6 hours from 57 &#176;C to 5 &#176;C [53] and not allowed to remain at temperatures between 12 &#176;C and 50 &#176;C, which can allow the spores to germinate and the vegetative bacteria to multiply to numbers that can cause food-poisoning after consumption of the meal. Meals that are prepared and stored should be reheated to at least 74 &#176;C for 15 sec before consumption [53].Chilled foods should be maintained in a refrigerator at <5 &#176;C to reduce growth of food-poisoning bacteria and maintain the safety and quality of the food. Listeria moncytogenes can grow slowly at temperatures as low as 3 &#176;C&#8211;5 &#176;C.\n6.5. Prevent Cross-Contamination of Foods\nRaw foods and ready-to-eat foods should be well-separated. Food-contact surfaces and equipment, including meat slicers, should be cleaned thoroughly. Separate equipment and utensils should be used for each item of raw food and for cooked food.\n6.6. Maintain Good Personal Hygiene\nGuidance in the UK specifies that staff who show symptoms of illness such as diarrhoea and/or vomiting must be excluded from working with or around open food, usually until at least 48 h after symptoms stop naturally [54]. In the case of people with symptoms caused by S. Typhi, S. Paratyphi, shiga-toxin-producing E. coli, and Hepatitis A virus more stringent requirements apply, and clearance by a medical professional is needed before a return to work. In the case of infection with norovirus, because of the ease with which the virus can be spread, it is advised that symptomatic food handlers should be excluded from the entire food business site, and remain away until at least 48 hours after symptoms stop.Comparable directions are given in the FDA Food Code [53], with similar conditions applied to Shigella and STEC infections. More stringent requirements are given for employees working in a food establishment that serves a highly susceptible population than for those not working in such an establishment.Persons who are asymptomatically infected may excrete small numbers of bacteria or viruses for weeks or more, those who show symptoms may continue to excrete the pathogen after they have recovered from symptoms of infection. Effective hand washing and good hygienic practices are important to prevent risk of infection.\n6.7. Low\u2014Microbial Diets\nFor clearly identified, vulnerable groups of people low-microbial diets or neutropenic diets have been advised by many organizations [9].The neutropenic diet prescribed by dieticians in the UK varies greatly [55]. According to Silk et al. [56] &#8220;evidence for the problem of unsafe food preparation and service for immune compromised and elderly patients is not only widespread, but also underestimated and can be expected to grow&#8221;. They proposed that professional organizations should promote, and large healthcare systems should establish, policies to prepare safe food for immune compromised patients and not serve them higher-risk foods, and that such practices could be implemented as the standard for hospital care. With the increase in vulnerable people in residential care and in the community, adherence to HACCP principles and policies for avoidance of higher&#8212;risk foods are needed in the supply of meals in these circumstances. It is important that general agreement be reached on recommendations for provision of safe food for vulnerable people and that arrangements should be made to review such recommendations in the light of new information and developments in the microbiological safety of food.\n7. Conclusions\nThe number of people in the population with increased susceptibility to foodborne illness is significant and is expected to increase. Many vulnerable people will be in hospitals, nursing or care homes, others will be living in the community. It is particularly important that businesses who supply food to vulnerable people in all these situations should have in place food safety management systems based on Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point principles and safe food-handling techniques. For clearly identified vulnerable people generally agreed advice should be given on avoidance of higher-risk foods and the use of lower-risk alternatives.", "pmid": "26308030", "title": "Microbiological Food Safety for Vulnerable People", "journal_title": "International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health", "authors": "Barbara M.

While it is estimated that 47 million people worldwide are presently living with dementia, it has been projected to escalate to 76 million by 2030. Currently there is no definitive diagnosis or effective treatment for AD. Understanding the molecular changes occurring from the preclinical stage of the disease, may present a better chance to ameliorate AD related pathogenic changes prior to them becoming irreversible.Given that fatty acids are essential components of cell membranes, playing a vital role in normal cellular functioning, several studies have reported altered brain fatty acid composition in AD1&#8211;3. Substantial evidence also presents an association between altered blood fatty acid concentrations and, cognitive impairment and dementia risk, particularly to that of AD4&#8211;6. Further, an increasing number of studies suggest that omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), primarily docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) are protective against cognitive impairment and dementia7&#8211;11, whereas arachidonic acid (AA), an omega-6 (n-6) PUFA, contributes towards AD pathogenesis12&#8211;15.The protective and deleterious effects of fatty acids have been explored with respect to cognitive impairment and clinical AD, however alterations in fatty acid profiles in individuals within the preclinical stage of AD, prior to any apparent cognitive impairment, have not been investigated before.Since aberrant accumulation of neocortical beta-amyloid load (NAL) has been reported to begin 15&#8211;20 years prior to the clinical manifestation of AD16, therefore serving as a preclinical feature of the disease, we compared the erythrocyte fatty acid composition of cognitively normal participants with high NAL (Standard uptake value ratio or SUVR&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;1.35) versus those with low NAL (SUVR&#8201;<&#8201;1.35), to evaluate alterations in fatty acid metabolism that manifest in the periphery, in the asymptomatic preclinical phase of AD, within this exploratory study.\nResults\n\nCohort characteristics\nParticipant demographics, serum cholesterol and hormone levels, APOE&#949;4 carrier status, MMSE scores and neuroimaging data including NAL and hippocampal volume have been presented in Table&#160;1.Table 1Characteristics of study participants.Low NALHigh NALpGender (M/F)19/4613/220.419Age (years, mean&#8201;&#177;&#8201;SD)77.61&#8201;&#177;&#8201;5.5579.22&#8201;&#177;&#8201;5.380.165BMI (mean&#8201;&#177;&#8201;SD)27.38&#8201;&#177;&#8201;4.4728.05&#8201;&#177;&#8201;4.730.486Education (years, mean&#8201;&#177;&#8201;SD)14.86&#8201;&#177;&#8201;3.3113.66&#8201;&#177;&#8201;2.840.078Total cholesterol (mmol/L, mean&#8201;&#177;&#8201;SD)4.82&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.984.35&#8201;&#177;&#8201;1.190.045Triglycerides (mmol/L, mean&#8201;&#177;&#8201;SD)1.34&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.701.10&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.420.071HDL cholesterol (mmol/L, mean&#8201;&#177;&#8201;SD)1.64&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.551.52&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.480.292LDL cholesterol (mmol/L, mean&#8201;&#177;&#8201;SD)2.39&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.852.34&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.880.794Testosterone (nmol/L, mean&#8201;&#177;&#8201;SD), males14.43&#8201;&#177;&#8201;6.1611.66&#8201;&#177;&#8201;3.770.160Testosterone (nmol/L, mean&#8201;&#177;&#8201;SD), females1.45&#8201;&#177;&#8201;2.551.26&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.810.738Oestradiol (pmol/L, mean&#8201;&#177;&#8201;SD), males113.16&#8201;&#177;&#8201;47.83117.23&#8201;&#177;&#8201;35.170.795Oestradiol (pmol/L, mean&#8201;&#177;&#8201;SD), females91.22&#8201;&#177;&#8201;118.7173.90&#8201;&#177;&#8201;28.970.523\nAPOE &#949;4 carriers (%)7.6945.710.00000848MMSE (mean&#8201;&#177;&#8201;SD)28.50&#8201;&#177;&#8201;1.1628.80&#8201;&#177;&#8201;1.100.225FBB-PET SUVR (mean&#8201;&#177;&#8201;SD)1.15&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.081.71&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.26&#8212;HV% (left; right lobes, mean&#8201;&#177;&#8201;SD)0.195&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.020; 0.199&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.0210.194&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.019; 0.199&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.0180.805; 0.890Baseline characteristics including gender, age, body mass index (BMI), education, serum cholesterol, hormone levels, APOE &#949;4 status, mini mental state examination (MMSE) scores, neocortical amyloid load (NAL) represented by the standard uptake value ratio (SUVR) of the ligand 18F-Florbetaben (FBB) in the neocortical region normalised with that in the cerebellum and hippocampal volume (HV) normalised by the intracranial volume, have been compared between study participants with low NAL (SUVR&#8201;<&#8201;1.35) and high NAL (SUVR&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;1.35). Chi-square test or linear models were employed as appropriate. HDL: high density lipoprotein, LDL: low density lipoprotein.\nAll participants had a MMSE score &#8805;26, indicating absence of cognitive impairment. While no significant differences in demographic data, hormone levels, MMSE and hippocampal volume were observed between low and high NAL, the frequency of APOE&#949;4 carriers was significantly higher in participants with high NAL compared to those with low NAL (p&#8201;<&#8201;0.0005).\nErythrocyte fatty acids and demographic characteristics\nAmong the erythrocyte FA measured, linoleic acid (C18:2n-6, &#946;&#8201;=&#8201;&#8722;0.228, p&#8201;=&#8201;0.022) and DHA (C22:6n-3, &#946;&#8201;=&#8201;&#8722;0.184, p&#8201;=&#8201;0.066) were observed to be inversely associated with age (Supplementary Table&#160;S1).Further, myristic acid (C14:0; p&#8201;<&#8201;0.01), arachidic acid (C20:0; p&#8201;<&#8201;0.05) and DHA (p&#8201;<&#8201;0.05) were observed to be significantly lower in males (n&#8201;=&#8201;32) compared to females (n&#8201;=&#8201;68), while DPA (C22:5n-3; p&#8201;<&#8201;0.01) was higher in males compared to females with and without adjusting for appropriate covariates. Furthermore, after adjusting for covariates, palmitoleic acid (C16:1; p&#8201;<&#8201;0.05) was significantly higher in females compared to males (Supplementary Table&#160;S2).\nErythrocyte fatty acids in \nOn comparing erythrocyte FA measured between APOE&#949;4 non-carriers (n&#8201;=&#8201;79) and carriers (n&#8201;=&#8201;21), linoleic acid (C18:2n-6; p&#8201;<&#8201;0.01) and eicosadienoic acid (C20:2n-6; p&#8201;<&#8201;0.05) were observed to be higher in the non-carriers with and without adjusting for appropriate covariates. Additionally, dihomo-&#947;-linolenic acid also appeared to be higher in the non-carriers after adjusting for appropriate covariates (Supplementary Table&#160;S3).Further, categorising participants into subjective memory complainers (n&#8201;=&#8201;76) and non-complainers (n&#8201;=&#8201;24), myristic acid was observed to be significantly higher (p&#8201;=&#8201;0.006) in memory complainers compared to non-complainers, with and without adjusting for covariates age, gender, APOE&#949;4, years of education and NAL (Supplementary Table&#160;S4).\nErythrocyte fatty acids and neocortical beta-amyloid load\nWhen erythrocyte FA measured in the current study were compared between low and high NAL, no significant differences were observed in saturated fatty acids (SFA) and mono unsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) between the two groups, with and without adjusting for covariates. Within the n-6 PUFA measured, linoleic acid (C18:2n-6; p&#8201;<&#8201;0.05) was significantly lower and AA (p&#8201;<&#8201;0.05) significantly elevated in high NAL compared to low NAL; however, after adjusting for covariates, only AA remained significant (p&#8201;<&#8201;0.05). Among the n-3 PUFA measured, linolenic acid (C18:3n-3) was significantly lower in high NAL (p&#8201;<&#8201;0.05), however after adjusting for covariates the significance in linolenic acid disappeared while docosapentaenoic acid (DPA, C22:5n-3, p&#8201;<&#8201;0.05) was observed to be significantly lower in high NAL (Fig.&#160;1). Additionally, a trend of lower EPA concentrations (p&#8201;=&#8201;0.063) and higher stearic acid levels (p&#8201;=&#8201;0.062) was observed in high NAL compared to low NAL (Table&#160;2).Figure 1Altered fatty acid levels in cognitively normal individuals with low and high NAL. Elevated erythrocyte arachidonic acid levels and decreased docosapentaenoic acid (n-3) levels were observed in individuals with high NAL (N&#8201;=&#8201;35) compared to those with low NAL (N&#8201;=&#8201;65), based on standard uptake value ratio cut off score of 1.35.

Low NAL was defined as SUVR&#8201;<&#8201;1.35 while high NAL was defined as SUVR&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;1.35. pa indicates p values adjusted for age, gender, years of education and APOE &#949;4 status; pb indicates p values adjusted age, gender, years of education, APOE &#949;4 status, body mass index, fatty acid supplement intake (cod liver oil, flaxseed oil), hormone replacement therapy. &#8216;&#8224;&#8217; indicates p-values obtained from variables transformed to the logarithmic scale for analyses. SFA: saturated fatty acids; MUFA: monounsaturated fatty acids; PUFA: polyunsaturated fatty acids; omega-3 index: sum of eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid, expressed as a percentage of total erythrocyte fatty acid measured.\nOn investigating associations between NAL and erythrocyte fatty acids measured, a positive trend between AA concentrations and NAL (&#946;&#8201;=&#8201;0.197, p&#8201;=&#8201;0.050) was observed, while an inverse trend was seen for linoleic acid (&#946;&#8201;=&#8201;&#8722;0.172, p&#8201;=&#8201;0.088).\nErythrocyte fatty acids and hippocampal volume\nFurther an inverse though non-significant association was observed between oleic acid and the left hippocampal volume (&#946;&#8201;=&#8201;&#8722;0.184, p&#8201;=&#8201;0.073), while DHA (&#946;&#8201;=&#8201;0.170, p&#8201;=&#8201;0.098) was seen to have a positive though non-significant association with the left hippocampal volume. Interestingly, within the subjective memory complainer group, these associations between hippocampal volume and oleic acid (&#946;&#8201;=&#8201;&#8722;0.264, p&#8201;=&#8201;0.023), and DHA (&#946;&#8201;=&#8201;0.229, p&#8201;=&#8201;0.050) became stronger.\nDietary intake of arachidonic acid and docosapentaenoic acid\nFurther, to explore whether dietary FA intake directly attributed to the alterations we observed in erythrocyte fatty acid concentrations, we assessed the dietary intake of fatty acids that were observed to be significantly different in erythrocytes of participants with high NAL against those with low NAL (primarily AA, DPA) and between APOE&#949;4 carriers and non-carriers (linoleic acid, eicosadienoic acid, dihomo-&#947;-linolenic acid), employing data from the CCVFFQ. No significant difference was observed in the dietary intake of AA and DPA between high NAL and low NAL with and without adjusting for covariates age, BMI, years of education and gender (Supplementary Table&#160;S5). Further, while lower dietary intake of eicosadienoic acid and dihomo-&#947;-linolenic acid were noted based on data from the CCVFFQ in APOE&#949;4 carriers compared to the non-carriers with and without adjusting for covariates age, BMI, years of education and gender, no significant difference in linoleic acid dietary intake was observed between APOE&#949;4 carriers and non-carriers (Supplementary Table&#160;S5).\nRatio of AA:DPA as a biomarker for predicting high neocortical beta-amyloid load\nFinally, given the observations of higher AA and lower DPA concentrations in high NAL compared to low NAL, we also evaluated the ratio of AA:DPA as a potential biomarker, by generating a &#8216;base&#8217; model comprising age, gender, APOE&#949;4 allele status and education, and compared it with &#8216;base&#8201;+&#8201;AA:DPA&#8217; model, wherein the ratio of AA:DPA was added to the &#8216;base&#8217; model. After adjusting for age, gender, APOE&#949;4 allele status and education, the ratio of AA:DPA was significantly associated with low and high NAL (p&#8201;=&#8201;0.02). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for the above mentioned models have been presented in Fig.&#160;2, such that the AUC of the &#8216;base&#8201;+&#8201;AA:DPA&#8217; model (AUC&#8201;=&#8201;0.836, 80% sensitivity, 73.8% specificity) was observed to outperform the &#8216;base&#8217; model (AUC&#8201;=&#8201;0.794, 80% sensitivity, 52.3% specificity).Figure 2Receiver operating characteristic curves for the prediction of high neocortical amyloid load. Receiver operating characteristic curves of logistic regression modelling shows that the specificity of the &#8216;base&#8217; model comprising major risk factors age and APOE &#949;4 allele status, and gender and education (a) was enhanced by adding the ratio of AA:DPA i.e. &#8216;base&#8201;+&#8201;AA:DPA&#8217; model (b) at 80% sensitivity. AUC: area under the curve; AA: arachidonic acid, DPA: Docosapentaenoic acid n-3.\n\nDiscussion\nThe current study reports erythrocyte fatty acid alterations, primarily in, AA and DPA, in elderly individuals with high NAL against those with low NAL, prior to cognitive impairment and significant differences in hippocampal atrophy (Table&#160;1).Elevated levels of erythrocyte AA were observed in high NAL, a feature of preclinical AD, compared to low NAL. Interestingly, several studies provide evidence to support the contributory role of increased AA to AD pathogenesis12&#8211;14, 17&#8211;19. AA and its pro-inflammatory eicosanoid metabolites such as prostaglandins, thromboxanes, and leukotrienes have been reported to promote beta-amyloid secretion13 and therefore not surprisingly AA metabolism is increased in AD brains12, 14. Furthermore, the depletion of an enzyme responsible for the release of AA (cytosolic phospholipase A2), has been reported to be protective against deficits in memory and learning in a transgenic AD mouse model17. AA has been shown to trigger apoptotic pathways in neurons20 and in vitro studies further suggest that AA promotes tau polymerization18, 19. The above studies consistently demonstrate that AA is positively associated with AD neuropathology and our findings, further show that an elevation in AA in the blood at a preclinical stage reflects preclinical-AD related pathogenic changes in the brain.On the other hand, a decline in erythrocyte DPA (n-3) levels, an intermediate between EPA and DHA, was observed in high NAL participants compared to low NAL. Given that AA and DPA (n-3) compete for the elongase enzyme21, it may be posited that elevated AA levels contribute to the declining levels of DPA (n-3) in high NAL. Interestingly, decreased erythrocyte DPA (n-3) concentrations have been reported in another neurological condition; patients with schizophrenia were observed to have 22% lower erythrocyte DPA (n-3) concentrations compared to healthy controls22. Conversely, DPA (n-3) supplementation has been observed to have neuroprotective and restorative effects on neuronal function in aged rats which acts through its ability to decrease age related oxidative stress and microglial activation23, therefore highlighting the anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties of DPA.DPA (n-3) levels were observed to be significantly lower in females compared to males. We therefore investigated DPA (n-3) levels after categorising participants based on gender and while we continued to find a significant decline in DPA (n-3) concentrations in high NAL males compared to low NAL males (p&#8201;<&#8201;0.05) with and without adjusting for covariates, this significance disappeared in females; however, this could be attributed to the modest sample size available for the observed effect size.However, in contrast to the significant associations often reported between lower blood DHA (and EPA) concentrations and increased risk to AD in participants with early symptomatic24 or clinical dementia6, 10, 11, significant alterations in erythrocyte DHA levels were not apparent between high and low NAL participants within the current study wherein all participants were cognitively normal. Given that previous findings suggest decreased blood DHA and EPA concentrations are linked with cognitive decline or impairment6, 25, may explain the absence of significantly declined erythrocyte DHA and EPA observations in high NAL compared to low NAL within the present study which only comprised participants who were within the cognitively normal range; however, this observation may also be attributed to the modest sample size employed within the study. Investigating whether participants falling within the lowest quartile of DHA at baseline (time point used in current study), become symptomatic at their one year follow-up visit, will provide further insight to our current report. However, the current findings indicate that alterations in AA and DPA manifest in the asymptomatic stage of the disease, and are not a direct result of dietary intake, and therefore may shed light on early disease mechanisms that may serve as beneficial therapeutic targets.Additionally, an inverse association between oleic acid and hippocampal volume was observed; given that hippocampal atrophy is a pathological hallmark of AD, and that elevated oleic acid concentrations feature in the more advanced stages of AD pathogenesis26 our findings in subjective memory complainers indicate that oleic acid may be an early marker for hippocampal atrophy.DHA has also been shown to be associated with hippocampal volume in early symptomatic dementia24 and clinical AD wherein participants with erythrocyte DHA levels in the first quartile, had lower total brain volumes compared to the upper 3 quartiles27. Similar to findings in our study, a trend of association between DHA and hippocampal volume has been highlighted previously by Pottala et al. in an elderly cohort that was free of dementia28. Furthermore, on categorizing participants into quartiles based on their erythrocyte DHA levels as employed by Tan et al., we also observed significantly higher hippocampal volume in participants with erythrocyte DHA levels in quartile 3 (mean&#8201;&#177;&#8201;SD: 0.20&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.02) compared to quartile 1 (mean&#8201;&#177;&#8201;SD: 0.18&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.01, p&#8201;=&#8201;0.002) and a trend in quartiles 2 (mean&#8201;&#177;&#8201;SD: 0.19&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.01, p&#8201;=&#8201;0.068) and 4 (mean&#8201;&#177;&#8201;SD: 0.19&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.01, p&#8201;=&#8201;0.058) compared to quartile 1.In addition, since the &#949;4 allele of APOE is a well-established risk factor for AD, we also investigated FA differences between non-carriers and carriers of the &#949;4 allele. Interestingly, significantly lower n-3 PUFA linolenic acid, and n-6 PUFA, linoleic acid and eicosadienoic acid, were observed in the APOE&#949;4 carriers compared to the non-carriers. These differences in linoleic acid and eicosadienoic acid remained significant following adjustment for covariates NAL, age, gender, BMI, education, supplement intake and hormone replacement therapy. Given that the dietary intake of linoleic acid from the CCVFFQ data did not indicate differential dietary intake between the two groups, it may be posited that an altered metabolism of linoleic acid occurs in APOE&#949;4 carriers29. Additionally, lower linoleic acid concentrations in APOE&#949;4 carriers along with the inverse trend observed between linoleic acid and NAL, may suggest that decreased linoleic acid may be indicative of an increased risk to AD; this decreased level of linoleic acid could be a result of increased metabolism of linoleic acid to arachidonic acid and its metabolites. Our findings in APOE&#949;4 carriers together with several other studies29&#8211;33, indicate the presence of a differential responsiveness to PUFA metabolism.The erythrocyte FA alterations observed between males and females, and between memory complainers and non-complainers, did not appear to be traceable to their dietary intake as assessed from the CCVFFQ (Supplementary Table&#160;S5). However, the authors acknowledge that data from food frequency questionnaires do not necessarily reflect an accurate evaluation of the dietary intake of FA but rather serve as a suitable reflection of exposure to certain food and nutrient types over a period of time, compared to the erythrocyte FA composition that reflects fatty acid intake or metabolism of approximately 120 days.To conclude, while it is acknowledged that the current study employs a modest sample size and that further longitudinal studies with larger sample sizes are required to validate the current novel observations, findings from the present study may imply that elevated AA and decreased DPA erythrocyte concentrations are an early event in the AD pathogenesis trajectory. Further, several studies have presented fatty acid alterations associated with cognitive decline and clinical AD, however the current study, using PET beta-amyloid imaging, is to our knowledge, the first to report fatty acid alterations associated with the preclinical phase of AD prior to cognitive impairment and disease related neuronal atrophy. In addition to highlighting the need for a re-evaluation of AA supplementation as an early therapeutic approach for AD34, 35, given the urgent need for early diagnosis and intervention strategies, our findings also provide insight on a potential early diagnostic candidate as well as alternative preventative targets for AD. Our findings of elevated AA and decreased DPA in subjects with high NAL indicate that inflammation and oxidative stress are early features of preclinical AD, and highlights the importance of evaluating anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative approaches to combat AD pathogenesis at its earliest.\nMethods\n\nParticipants\nParticipants belonged to the McCusker Kerr Anglican Retirement Village Initiative in Ageing Health (KARVIAH) study cohort, at baseline. Participants were residents of Anglicare (formally known as Anglican Retirement Villages), aged 65&#8211;90 years, living within retirement living accommodations in Sydney, Australia. Among the 206 volunteers, 143 met the set inclusion and exclusion criteria (refer to supplementary material) and were deemed eligible for the KARVIAH cohort. One hundred and five participants, out of the 143 volunteers meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria, at the screening phase for this study, progressed to undertake neuropsychological testing, blood collection and neuroimaging, since the remaining either withdrew from the study or declined undergoing positron emission tomography.Following the screening assessment, among the 105 participants, 100 participants were recorded to have a Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score &#8805;26 at baseline, and were therefore selected for the current study. Within these 100 participants (of which four reported oral fatty acid supplement intake and two participants were undergoing hormone replacement therapy), 65 were categorised as low NAL and 35 as high NAL, based on their neocortical beta-amyloid load assessed via positron emission tomography (PET). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. The Bellberry Human Research Ethics Committee Australia provided approval for the study and all methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations.\nPhysical examination and sample processing\nOvernight fasted participants underwent a brief physical examination measuring weight, height, pulse and blood pressure, followed by blood draw. Subsequently, erythrocytes were isolated from the blood collected and fractionated as previously described36 and were stored at &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C, until used for further analyses. Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype was determined from 0.5&#8201;ml whole blood employing standard PCR methodology37.\nErythrocyte fatty acid analysis\n\nFatty acid derivatisation and gas chromatography\nErythrocyte samples underwent transesterification prior to gas chromatography38. Briefly, 2&#8201;ml of methanol-toluene (4:1, v/v) containing 20&#8201;&#181;g/ml of C19:0 as internal standard was added to 200&#8201;&#181;l of the thawed sample, followed by the addition of 200&#8201;ul acetyl chloride while vortexing, after which the tubes were heated for 1&#8201;hour at 100&#8201;&#176;C. The tubes were then cooled in water for 5&#8201;min following which 5&#8201;ml of 6% K2CO3 was added to the tubes prior to centrifugation at 3000&#8201;g for 5&#8201;min at 4&#8201;&#176;C. The upper toluene phase was collected and stored in a gas chromatography (GC) vial at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C until GC analysis was performed.Fatty acid methyl esters were analysed by gas chromatography (Shimadzu GC-2010 Plus system) using a 30&#8201;m&#8201;&#215;&#8201;0.25&#8201;mm ID Restek Famewax (Shimadzu Scientific) fused silica capillary column. Ultra-pure hydrogen was used as a carrier and the oven temperature was programmed from 130&#8201;&#176;C to 225&#8201;&#176;C at a rate of 6&#8201;&#176;C per min. Injector and detector temperatures were set at 220&#8201;&#176;C and 230&#8201;&#176;C, respectively. A split ratio of 1:30 and an injection volume of 1&#8201;&#181;l were used. Internal standard methylnonadecanoate (19:0; cat. no. N-5377, Sigma-Aldrich) and a fatty acid mixture (cat. no. 18919-1AMP SUPELCO, Sigma-Aldrich) were used to compare analysed samples to identify peaks according to retention time. Calibration curves for each fatty acid were built using a range of concentrations of a mixture of authentic fatty acid standards. Chromatography data were recorded and integrated using LabSolutions software (Version 5.81 SP1). Individual fatty acid concentrations were reported as a percentage of total erythrocyte fatty acids measured.\nDietary fatty acid intake\nThe dietary intake of specific erythrocyte FA observed to be altered between high and low NAL, and APOE&#949;4 carriers and non-carriers, were investigated to establish whether diet attributed to the observations made, employing data from the Cancer Council of Victoria Food Frequency Questionnaire (CCVFFQ)39. The CCVFFQ is a paper-based semi-quantitative seventy-four item questionnaire. The CCVFFQ was optically scanned to obtain nutrient intakes in gram/day. Participants filled out the CCVFFQ when they attended the research centre for their baseline assessment.\nNeuropsychological tests\nStudy participants underwent a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests, measuring episodic memory, executive function, attention, visuospatial abilities, language, processing speed and working memory, however, for the current study only MMSE (range 0&#8211;30, indicating severe impairment to no impairment) scores40 were employed to confirm no cognitive impairment, and the Memory Assessment Clinic - Questionnaire (MAC-Q) scores41 were considered to differentiate between subjective memory complainers (range 25&#8211;35) from non-complainers (range &#8804;24).\nNeuroimaging\nAll participants within the current study underwent PET imaging using ligand 18F-Florbetaben (FBB) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within three months of blood collection, at the Macquarie Medical Imaging located within Macquarie University Hospital, Sydney, Australia. Participants were administered an intravenous bolus of FBB slowly over 30&#8201;s, while in a rested position. Images were acquired over a 20&#8201;min scan beginning 50&#8201;min post injection. NAL was calculated as the mean standard uptake value ratio (SUVR) of the frontal, superior parietal, lateral temporal, lateral occipital, and anterior and posterior cingulate42, 43. An SUVR cut-off value of 1.35 was utilised to categorise participants into high and low NAL.In addition, participants underwent a sagittal 3D T1 spoiled gradient recalled acquisition in steady state and 3D T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery with axial dual echo Turbo spin echo PD/T2 weighted sequences and axial T2 star gradient sequence scans, performed on a General Electric 3 Tesla scanner (GE, Model 750&#8201;W), utilising a 24 channel head coil. Hippocampal volume was calculated from the images acquired and was normalized by dividing with the total intracranial volume consisting of the sum of the cerebrospinal fluid, gray matter and white matter volumes. Due to MRI exclusion criteria and related health conditions, 4 of the 100 were unable to undergo the MRI imaging component of the study.\nStatistical Analyses\nDescriptive statistics were calculated for low and high NAL groups. Chi-square tests were employed to compare gender and APOE&#949;4 carrier status between low and high NAL groups. Linear models were utilised to compare continuous parameters between groups of interest, with and without adjusting for covariates age, gender, APOE&#949;4, education, body mass index, supplement intake and hormone replacement therapy, and to investigate associations between fatty acid measures and age and, neuroimaging data. All continuous parameters were checked for normality, and those that deviated were transformed appropriately prior to conducting analyses. The receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves and the area under the curve (AUC) were derived from the predictive probabilities of the logistic regression models. No correction for multiple comparisons was made, due to the exploratory nature of the current study. All analyses were carried out using IBM&#174; SPSS&#174; Version 20, except for the ROC curves, which were generated using package, Deducer on R (version 3.2.5).\nElectronic supplementary material\n\nNone\n\nSupplementary material\n", "pmid": "28386119", "title": "Alterations in erythrocyte fatty acid composition in preclinical Alzheimer&#8217;s disease", "journal_title": "Scientific Reports", "authors": "Kathryn Goozee;Pratishtha Chatterjee;Ian James;Kaikai Shen;Hamid R.

Dengue epidemics are still occurring around the world, indicating an urgent need of prophylactic vaccines and antivirals. In recent years, a great deal has been learned about the mechanisms of dengue virus genome amplification. However, little is known about the process by which the capsid protein recruits the viral genome during encapsidation. Here, we found that the mature capsid protein in the cytoplasm of dengue virus infected cells accumulates on the surface of ER-derived organelles named lipid droplets. Mutagenesis analysis using infectious dengue virus clones has identified specific hydrophobic amino acids, located in the center of the capsid protein, as key elements for lipid droplet association. Substitutions of amino acid L50 or L54 in the capsid protein disrupted lipid droplet targeting and impaired viral particle formation. We also report that dengue virus infection increases the number of lipid droplets per cell, suggesting a link between lipid droplet metabolism and viral replication. In this regard, we found that pharmacological manipulation of the amount of lipid droplets in the cell can be a means to control dengue virus replication. In addition, we developed a novel genetic system to dissociate cis-acting RNA replication elements from the capsid coding sequence. Using this system, we found that mislocalization of a mutated capsid protein decreased viral RNA amplification. We propose that lipid droplets play multiple roles during the viral life cycle; they could sequester the viral capsid protein early during infection and provide a scaffold for genome encapsidation.", "body": "Introduction\nThe genus Flavivirus comprises a large group of emerging and re-emerging pathogens capable of causing severe human diseases. It includes yellow fever (YFV), dengue (DENV), West Nile (WNV), tick borne encephalitis (TBEV), and Japanese encephalitis (JEV) viruses. DENV is the most significant mosquito borne human viral pathogen worldwide. It infects more than 50 million people each year, resulting in around 25,000 deaths. The lack of vaccines and antivirals against DENV leaves the 2 billion people at risk, mainly in poor countries, in a constant state of alarm [1].The replication cycle of different members of the Flavivirus genus is fundamentally similar. The viral genome is a single plus-stranded RNA molecule that serves as messenger for viral protein synthesis, template for RNA amplification, and substrate for encapsidation [2]. In recent years, a number of cis-acting RNA elements have been identified in the coding and uncoding regions of the flavivirus genomes as promoters, enhancers, and cyclization signals necessary for efficient amplification of the viral RNA (for review see [3]). A mechanism by which the viral polymerase specifically recognizes and copies the viral genome has been recently proposed [4]. In contrast, little is known about the recognition of the viral RNA by the capsid (C) protein. For flaviviruses, it is still unclear how, when, and where the C protein recruits the viral RNA during viral particle morphogenesis. In this work, we used DENV to investigate how the C protein usurps cellular organelles to facilitate viral replication.The flavivirus genomes contain a long ORF encoding a polyprotein that is cleaved into three structural proteins (C, prM, and E) and seven nonstructural proteins (NS1-NS2A- NS2B-NS3-NS4A-NS4B-NS5) [5]. The proteins C and prM are connected by an internal hydrophobic signal sequence that spans the ER membrane and is responsible for the translocation of prM into the ER lumen. The first cleavage is accomplished by the viral NS3/2B protease, which resides in the cytoplasmic side of the ER membrane and separates the mature C protein from its membrane anchor sequence [6]&#8211;[8]. It has been proposed that the mature form of the C protein remains associated to intracellular membranes via an internal hydrophobic region conserved in all flaviviruses [9].In flavivirus infected cells, the C protein was detected both in the cytoplasm and the nucleus [10]&#8211;[13]. Inside the nucleus it has been shown to accumulate in the nucleolus. The cytoplasmic fraction of the C protein of kunjin virus (KUNV) was found near structures called convoluted membranes in close association with vesicle packets, which are the sites of RNA replication [11],[14],[15]. A recent report has demonstrated a complex membrane architecture that links flavivirus genome replication and viral assembly [16]. A coupling between RNA synthesis and RNA encapsidation has been also suggested [17]. It was shown that viral RNAs were not encapsidated if they were not actively synthesized in the replication complexes. Interestingly, a complex connection between the encapsidation process and proteins of the RNA replication machinery is emerging. Specific amino acids changes in NS2A and NS3 were found to impair particle formation [18]&#8211;[21]. Whether these NS proteins bind to the C protein, to the viral RNA, or to cellular components (proteins or membranes) is still unknown.The mature C is a highly basic protein of 12 kDa that forms homodimers in solution [22],[23]. The first 32 and the last 26 residues of the KUNV C protein were proposed to interact with the viral RNA [24]. The tridimensional structures of DENV and WNV C proteins were recently solved by NMR and crystallography, respectively [25],[26]. These studies indicated that the monomer contains four alpha helices (&#945;1 to &#945;4). The first 20 amino acids are unstructured in solution and were cleaved in the WNV C crystals [26]. The first 3 helices (&#945;1 to &#945;3) form a right handed bundle that comprises the monomer core. The different orientation of &#945;1 in WNV and DENV suggested that this helix is flexible. The &#945;4, the longest helix, extends away from the monomer core and has a high density of basic residues on the solvent accessible surface, which were proposed to interact with the viral RNA. On the opposite side of the molecule, the surface contributed by &#945;2&#8722;&#945;2&#8242; and &#945;1&#8722;&#945;1&#8242; is largely uncharged and is proposed to interact with membranes [25]. The originally described internal hydrophobic region, residues 46 to 66 in DENV C, includes helices &#945;2 and &#945;3 [9]. Although the C protein is the least conserved of the flavivirus proteins, the structural properties are very similar and the charge distribution is well conserved.Here, we investigated the subcellular localization of the C protein in DENV infected cells and found that the cytoplasmic C accumulates around ER-derived organelles called lipid droplets (LDs). A novel reporter system was developed, which allowed us to dissociate cis-acting signals for RNA synthesis from the C coding sequence. Using infectious DENV RNAs and the new reporter system, specific residues in the &#945;2 helix of the C protein were identified as crucial determinants for LD localization and DENV particle formation. Furthermore, we report that pharmacological inhibition of LD formation greatly decreases DENV replication, providing new ideas for antiviral strategies.\nResults\n\nLipid droplet localization of DENV C protein in infected cells\nLocalization of the C protein in the cytoplasm and the nucleus of DENV infected cells has been previously reported. The nuclear localization was carefully analyzed by several groups [12],[13]. In contrast, there is limited information regarding the distribution of the C protein in the cytoplasm of the infected cell, which is the place of viral encapsidation. To investigate the subcellular localization of the C protein during viral replication, DENV2 was used to infect BHK cells. As previously described, when cells were fixed with methanol and used for indirect immunofluorescence, the C protein was found in the nucleus and accumulated in the nucleolus (Fig. 1A, left panel). Methanol fixation is known to extract cellular lipids. Therefore, in order to preserve the membranous structures induced by viral infection, and to investigate the distribution of C in the cytoplasm, DENV infected cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with a low concentration of Triton X-100. Remarkably, in these conditions, all the infected cells showed C protein accumulation in defined spherical structures (Fig. 1A, right panel). Higher magnification of the images using confocal microscopy revealed that the C protein was organized in a ring-like pattern (Fig. 1A). Co-localization of DENV C with ER or Golgi markers was not observed in these conditions (data not shown). The images of C labeling after DENV infection resembled the distribution of the core protein reported for hepatitis C (HCV), which accumulates on the surface of lipid droplets (LDs) [27]&#8211;[29]. To analyze whether DENV C associates to these organelles, infected cells were labeled with antibodies against C and incubated with BODIPY, which stains neutral lipids in LDs. These studies revealed that most of the C protein observed was present around LDs (Fig. 1B). Localization of the C protein surrounding LDs was observed in different DENV infected human cells such as HepG2 and HeLa (Fig. 1B and data not shown). In addition, because DENV is a mosquito borne virus, we examined the localization of C in infected mosquito C6/36 cells. The cytoplasmic localization of C in these cells was also surrounding LDs (Fig. 1B).To further study the association of C with LDs, sucrose gradients were used to separate the LD fraction by flotation. The presence of C and the adipose differentiation-related protein (ADRP or adipophilin, LD marker) were detected by western blots. A fraction of C was detected together with ADRP in LDs (Fig. 1C). In this fraction the lactate dehydrogenase activity was not detected, indicating lack of cytosolic contamination. The amount of C observed in the LD fraction was lower than that expected according to the co-localization observed with BODIPY (Fig. 1C). It is possible that the viral protein partially dissociates during cell disruption and biochemical fractionation. In order to further analyze the localization of C in the cytoplasm of DENV infected cells, co-localization of C with ADRP was also determined. These studies showed the presence of C and ADRP on LDs (Fig. 1D). Early after infection, we observed single LDs carrying both proteins, C and ADRP. In addition, droplets containing either C or ADRP were also observed.LDs are ER-derived organelles that contain a core of neutral lipids enclosed by a monolayer of phospholipids and exhibit variable protein content [30]. The metabolism of LDs has attracted considerable attention due to its link with human diseases such as obesity, inflammation, and cancer [31],[32]. LDs are found in different cell types in normal conditions. However, it was noticeable that DENV infection increased the size and the amount of LDs per cell. Quantitative analysis showed a 3-fold increase in the amount of LDs in DENV infected cells as compared with mock infected cells (Fig. 1E). To investigate whether C was the viral factor responsible for the increase in the number of LDs, droplets were enumerated in cells expressing only the C protein. BHK cells were transfected with an expression vector encoding the mature form of C or a control vector. The level of expression of the C protein was slightly higher than that observed in DENV infected cells. Enumeration of droplets indicated that the viral protein increased about 2-fold the amount of LDs per cell (Fig. 1F). The higher increase of LDs observed after DENV infection in respect to that observed in cells expressing only C could be due to the different source of the protein when it is produced from the viral polyprotein. In addition, it is possible that other viral factors or the infection itself affects LD metabolism. Thus, we evaluated the amount of LDs in DENV replicon-expressing BHK cells. In this case, the amount of LDs was not significantly different to that observed in replicon-cured cells (data not shown).The accumulation of the viral C protein around LDs and the increased number of droplets observed in DENV-infected cells provide the first link between these organelles and DENV replication.\nThe mature C protein is targeted to LD in the absence of other viral proteins\nDuring flavivirus polyprotein synthesis, the C protein is targeted to the ER membrane by the anchor peptide, which is removed by the viral NS3/2B protease in the cytoplasm and the host signal peptidase in the ER lumen (Fig. 2A, left panel). To investigate whether the anchor peptide plays a role in targeting the C protein to LDs, a full-length genomic DENV cDNA was modified to include an artificial FMDV2A cleavage site at the C-terminus of the C protein (DENV-FMDV2A), which would release co-translationally the mature C protein. Transfection of DENV-WT or DENV-FMDV2A RNAs into BHK cells resulted in efficient translation and amplification of viral RNAs (data not shown). Appropriate cleavage of C by the FMDV 2A was demonstrated by Western blot analysis of cytoplasmic extracts obtained at 24 and 48 h post-transfection using anti-C antibodies (Fig. 2A, right panel). As expected, DENV-FMDV2A RNA produced a C protein about 2 kDa larger than the WT protein, corresponding to C plus 19 amino acids of the FMDV2A (Fig. 2A, C2A). Confocal microscopy analysis indicated that the prematurely processed C protein localized almost exclusively around LDs, indicating that the anchor peptide that targets the C protein to ER membranes during polyprotein synthesis is not required for protein C localization on LDs (Fig. 2B).To determine whether C association to LDs requires other viral components, the mature C protein was expressed using a plasmid under control of the CMV promoter in BHK cells. Cells were analyzed by immunofluorescence using anti-C antibodies and stained with BODIPY at 10, 24 and 48 h post-transfection. Although the level of mature C protein expressed in BHK cells was higher than that observed after DENV infection, most of the expressed C protein also accumulated around LDs (Fig. 2C). This analysis indicates that the mature C protein, in the absence of other viral components, is able to associate to LDs.\nSpecific amino acids in the \u03b12 helix are involved in C association to LDs\nThe molecular basis of C protein association to LDs was then investigated. To this end, we used the model proposed for DENV C interaction with cellular membranes based on the structural information previously obtained by NMR [25]. The model implicates a concave shaped hydrophobic cleft including amino acids of &#945;1 and &#945;2 helices and the connecting loop (Fig. 3A, left panel). We also considered the information provided in previous analysis describing a flavivirus conserved internal hydrophobic region, spanning amino acids 46 to 66 (&#945;2 and &#945;3) in DENV, which was proposed to interact with ER membranes [9]. Amino acids substitutions of residues around the hydrophobic cleft were designed in the context of the full length DENV genome as described in Fig. 3A, and localization of the C protein was followed by confocal microscopy after RNA transfection. Substitutions of uncharged amino acids in &#945;1 helix or in the &#945;1&#8211;&#945;2 connecting loop resulted in C proteins that accumulated in LDs, similar to that observed with the WT virus (Fig. 3B). In addition, deletion of the complete &#945;2 helix or substitution of hydrophobic amino acids within &#945;3 resulted in the synthesis of an unstable C protein that was barely detected by immunofluorescence (data not shown). Interestingly, a substitution of the two hydrophobic residues (L50 and L54) within &#945;2 that are facing outwards from the &#945;2&#8722;&#945;2&#8242; plane, rendered a C protein that was distributed throughout the cytoplasm without evident association to LDs (Fig. 3B, Mut &#945;2), providing evidence of an important role of these amino acids in C protein-membrane association.To better define the role of L50 and L54 on C targeting to LDs, we designed the individual mutants L50S (Mut &#945;2.1) and L54S (Mut &#945;2.2). Localization of C after RNA transfection showed a defect in the distribution of these proteins in the cytoplasm when compared with the WT (Fig. 3C). We observed the presence of Mut &#945;2.1 and Mut &#945;2.2 C proteins throughout the cytoplasm; however, in contrast to that observed with the Mut &#945;2, small patches of Mut &#945;2.1 and Mut &#945;2.2 C proteins were detected on LDs (Fig. 3C). These results indicate that both amino acids, L50 and L54, are necessary for proper targeting of C to LDs.\nMutant \u03b12 retains the ability to bind RNA and to dimerize in solution\nTo investigate whether the mutation L50S&#8211;L54S alters C protein folding, dimerization, or RNA binding, biochemical properties of the recombinant proteins were analyzed. The mature WT and mutated C proteins were cloned in an expression vector in the absence of a tag. Purification was performed by heparin columns and gel filtration. Expression and purification of the CL50SL54S mutant were indistinguishable from the WT protein (Fig. 4A). The oligomerization state of the proteins was determined by size exclusion chromatography and light scattering. Single picks corresponding to molecular weights of 23.8 and 24.9 kDa were obtained for the CWT and the CL50SL54S respectively, which are consistent with dimer formation.To determine whether the mutation could interfere with the ability of the C protein to bind RNA, mobility shift and filter binding assays were performed to estimate the dissociation constants. A radiolabeled RNA was used for titration with different concentrations of CWT or CL50SL54S. The dissociation constants were not significantly different, 22 nM and 20 nM for the WT and the mutant, respectively (Fig. 4B and 4C). The results indicate that the L50S&#8211;L54S mutation introduced in the C protein did not alter protein folding or other known properties of the protein.\nAssociation of C to LDs is necessary for DENV replication\nTo investigate the effect of mutating C on DENV replication, cells were transfected with WT or mutant RNAs that produce stable C proteins (Mut &#945;1, Mut &#945;1&#8211;&#945;2 loop, Mut &#945;2, Mut &#945;2.1, and Mut &#945;2.2). Viral replication in transfected cells was evaluated by immunofluorescence as a function of time and by assessing the production of infectious viral particles by plaque assay. Mut &#945;1 and Mut &#945;1&#8211;&#945;2 loop produced titers similar to the WT at 24, 48 and 72 h (Fig. 5A). After 96 h the titers decreased due to extensive cytopathic effect and death of the transfected cells. In contrast, the titers for Mut &#945;2.1 and Mut &#945;2.2 were about two orders of magnitude lower than that for the parental virus. In addition, no viral particles were detected in the supernatants of cells transfected with Mut &#945;2 up to 5 days post-transfection (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, the immunofluorescence assays indicated that while the WT, Mut &#945;1, and Mut &#945;1&#8211;&#945;2 loop showed the complete monolayer antigen-positive for DENV at day 3, Mut &#945;2.1 and Mut &#945;2.2 showed a propagation delay, and no viral propagation was detected in cells transfected with Mut &#945;2 until day 15 (data not shown). The results indicate that mutations that alter C targeting to LDs produced defects in viral replication.To investigate whether the viruses carrying the mutations in the &#945;2 helix produced viral particles that were not infectious, we determined the presence of the viral envelope (E) protein in the media. Western blot analysis indicated that the amount of the E protein released from cells transfected with Mut &#945;2.1 and &#945;2.2 was less than 5% of that observed with the WT (Fig. 5B). In addition, the E protein was undetectable in the media of cells transfected with Mut &#945;2 RNA. Moreover, viral RNA was quantified in the media of cells infected with WT, Mut &#945;2.1, and &#945;2.2 using real time RT-PCR (Fig. 5C). The amount of viral RNA detected for both mutants was about two logs lower than that for the parental virus, which correlated with the amount of infectious particles produced in Fig. 5A. These results indicate that the mutations in the &#945;2 helix of the C protein impair the production of DENV particles.\nDissecting cis-acting RNA replication signals from the C coding sequence\nWe have recently developed a DENV reporter system to evaluate each step of DENV replication [33]. To further characterize the defect of the DENV C mutants, we introduced the substitutions in the reporter virus (DV-R). Controls and mutated viral RNAs were transfected in BHK cells and luciferase activity was monitored as a function of time as previously reported [33]. Unexpectedly, transfection of Mut &#945;2 DV-R showed a delayed increase in luciferase activity during viral RNA synthesis (data not shown). Because flavivirus structural proteins do not participate in viral RNA amplification [34],[35], this observation was puzzling. It is possible that the substitution introduced in the &#945;2 helix alters RNA structures present in the C coding sequence that have been previously reported to be involved in genome cyclization and RNA amplification [3]. In fact, the presence of overlapping signals in the viral genome has been a limitation in studying the effect of mutations in the N-terminus of C on viral encapsidation. Thus, to properly analyze the defects in replication of DENV C mutants, we designed a new DENV reporter system dissociating the cis-acting signals from the C coding region. To this end, we introduced a duplication of the first 104 nucleotides of the C coding region, called here the cis-acting element CAE (including the previously described cHP and the cyclization sequence 5&#8242;CS) [36]&#8211;[38]. The CAE was fused to the luciferase coding region followed by the complete DENV ORF (Fig. 6A, monocistronic DENV reporter, mDV-R). Between the luciferase and the DENV structural proteins an FMDV2A protease was introduced to ensure the release of the reporter protein. In summary, the new reporter DENV contained a physical separation of the CAE sequences and the C coding region. Transfection of the mDV-R RNA resulted in efficient viral replication and production of infectious viral particles (Fig. 6B and C, WT).To investigate the replication of mutants in the &#945;2 helix that impair LD association without altering the cis-acting RNA elements, Mut &#945;2, Mut &#945;2.1, and Mut &#945;2.2 were introduced in the mDV-R. The RNAs corresponding to the mDV-R WT, the three mutants in the &#945;2 helix, the propagation impaired mutant containing the complete deletion of C coding sequence (Mut &#916;C), or the replication impaired mutant carrying a substitution in the polymerase NS5 (Mut NS5), were transfected into BHK cells (Fig. 6B). The Mut &#916;C mDV-R showed luciferase levels at 24 and 48 h post-transfection that were indistinguishable from the WT mDV-R levels, confirming that the C protein is dispensable for RNA synthesis and indicating that the duplication of the CAE was fully functional (Fig. 6B, compare Mut &#916;C with the positive and negative controls, WT and Mut NS5, respectively). Similarly, Mut &#945;2.1 and Mut &#945;2.2 translated and replicated the RNA efficiently. In contrast, while the Mut &#945;2 RNA was translated as the parental RNA (see luciferase activity at 4 h post-transfection), the luciferase levels detected at 24 and 48 h were reduced about 40 fold in respect to the WT control (Fig. 6B). These results indicate that while deletion of the complete C protein or the individual mutations L50S and L54S did not affect DENV RNA synthesis, the more drastic change that included both substitutions did, and this effect was not due to alteration of the cis-acting elements.To analyze the ability of the mutants in the C protein to produce reporter infectious particles, we collected the supernatants of the transfected cells as a function of time and used them to infect fresh BHK cells. As expected, the luciferase activity in cells infected with the media obtained from cells transfected with Mut &#916;C was undetectable (Fig. 6C). Similarly, the Mut &#945;2 failed to produce viral particles. After infection with the media of cells transfected with Mut &#945;2.1 or Mut &#945;2.2, between 50 and 200 fold lower luciferase activity than that with WT mDV-R was observed. These results confirm a direct role of amino acids L50 and L54 on viral particle formation.The decreased level of RNA amplification of Mut &#945;2 presented in Fig. 6B was unexplained; thus, we decided to further analyze this observation. Knowing that the C protein has high affinity for RNA molecules, a plausible explanation could be that a mistargeted C protein, which accumulates in the cytoplasm, prematurely binds the viral RNA or interacts with other factor involved in viral RNA replication. To analyze this possibility, we studied the RNA synthesis of WT DENV in cells producing the WT or mutated C proteins in trans. BHK cells expressing a mature form of CWT or CL50SL54S were transfected with the WT reporter DENV RNA, and luciferase activity was monitored as a function of time. Over-expression of CWT or CL50SL54S proteins was not toxic for BHK cells as determined by MTS assays. Cells expressing CWT showed accumulation of the viral protein in LDs, while the ones expressing CL50SL54S showed a cytoplasmic distribution without a significant accumulation in LDs (Fig. 6D, right panel). Luciferase activity was determined in cells at 4, 24, 48 and 72 h post-transfection (Fig. 6D). Cells expressing the CWT showed luciferase levels at 48 and 72 h about 10 and 30 fold higher, respectively, than those in cells expressing the CL50SL54S. These results suggest that the mutated protein expressed in trans was able to decrease the level of viral RNA amplification.Taken together, the new reporter DENV allowed us to dissociate the processes of RNA replication and encapsidation, demonstrated that C is dispensable for RNA synthesis, and confirmed an important role of amino acids L50 and L54 in viral particle formation. In addition, the results suggest that a mislocalized C protein could interfere with viral RNA synthesis, providing evidence for a possible role of LDs in coordinating different viral processes.\nLDs as target for DENV inhibition\nHere, we found that targeting C protein to LDs is necessary for DENV particles formation. In addition, we observed that viral infection increases the amount of LDs. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that interfering with LDs formation/metabolism could be a means for antiviral intervention. To prove this idea, we used a fatty acid synthase inhibitor (C75) that was previously designed for obesity control [39]&#8211;[41]. It has been reported that this drug reduces the amount of LDs in the cell and inhibits pre-adipocyte differentiation. First, we analyzed the effect of C75 on the amount of LDs in DENV-infected and non-infected cells. The concentration of drug used was determined to be non-toxic for BHK cells (data not shown). Quantitative analyses of LDs in BHK cells showed that concentrations between 10 and 20 &#181;M of drug decreased the amount of LD in DENV-infected and mock-infected cells (Fig. 7A). To determine the effect of C75 on viral replication, cells were treated with 10 and 20 &#181;M of compound, infected with DENV2 using a multiplicity of infection of 1, and viral titers were determined at 24 and 48 h post-infection by plaque assay (Fig. 7B). Using 20 &#181;M of C75, a drop in two orders of magnitude in the viral titer at 48 h and complete inhibition of viral replication at 24 h were observed. Similar results were obtained when C75 treated HepG2 cells were infected with DENV (data not shown). To determine how the drug affects each step of viral replication, the reporter DENV was used. Luciferase activity was measured in extracts of BHK cells infected with mDV-R in the presence or absence of C75. At 10 h post-infection the luciferase levels were unaffected by the inhibitor, suggesting that the drug was not interfering with viral entry or translation (Fig. 7C, left panel). At 24 and 48 h post-infection a reduction of luciferase levels of about 4-fold was observed, which corresponds to a decrease in RNA amplification. To investigate the effect of the drug on infectious viral particle formation, the media from cells subjected to each treatment was collected 48 h after infection and used to infect fresh cells in the absence of C75. At this time, an inhibition of more than 1000-fold was observed, indicating a profound effect of C75 on viral particle production (Fig. 7D). These results indicate that altering the LD metabolism can be a means to block DENV replication.\nDiscussion\nGenome packaging is one of the most obscure steps of the flavivirus life cycle. Here, we provide the first evidence linking DENV particle formation with ER derived LDs. We found that DENV infected cells accumulate the C protein around LDs and this localization is crucial for infectious particle formation. Specific hydrophobic amino acids were identified as key determinants for LD association. In addition, we developed a new genetic tool to exclude cis-acting RNA replication signals from the C coding sequence. Using this system, we found that mislocalization of a mutated C protein interferes with DENV RNA synthesis. Our studies support the idea that DENV exploits LDs for multiple purposes during DENV replication. Furthermore, relevant to the urgent need for antiviral strategies against DENV, we report that pharmacologic alteration of LD metabolism also inhibits DENV replication in cell culture.\nStructural features of \n\nFlavivirus is one of the three genera of the Flaviviridae family together with the Hepaci- and Pestivirus\n[2]. The C proteins of the three genera do not exhibit significant sequence homology or common domain organization. However, they are all dimeric, basic proteins with an overall helical fold, responsible for genome packaging. In addition, a recent report has suggested a common RNA chaperone activity for these C proteins [42]. Hepacivirus mature core proteins are about 170 amino acids in length and consist of two domains, a highly basic N-terminal domain (D1) and a hydrophobic C-terminal domain (D2) [43]. In contrast, pesti- and flavivirus C proteins are shorter, between 90 to 100 residues, lacking a D2 domain. Compelling evidence has been accumulated in recent years supporting the idea that HCV particle formation requires C protein association to LDs, and that the D2 domain is responsible for targeting C to this organelle [28], [29], [44]&#8211;[49]. Because the flavivirus C proteins lack a D2 domain, an association of DENV C protein to LDs was unexpected.Using DENV-infected cells, we found that the C protein accumulated on LDs. Hydrophobic residues in the &#945;2 helix of DENV C were defined as important determinants for LD association and viral particle formation. In contrast, mutations of uncharged residues in &#945;1 helix or in the connecting loop between &#945;1 and &#945;2 helices did not alter LD association or viral propagation. The importance of an internal hydrophobic region including the &#945;2 helix was originally described in DENV4, and more recently was reported to be necessary for efficient propagation of different flaviviruses [9], [50]&#8211;[52]. A recent study using WNV reported that deletions within the most hydrophobic section of &#945;2 helix (LALLAFF) impaired viral propagation [53]. However, pseudorevertants with extended deletions of C from amino acid 40 to 76 were recovered in culture. These results indicated that a large deletion of about 36 amino acids was better tolerated than 4&#8211;7 amino acid deletions in the hydrophobic region, suggesting that a short version of the C protein could form nucleocapsids by an alternative mechanism. A remarkable functional flexibility of the C protein was observed in TBEV, in which deletions from 19 to 30 residues were rescued by second site mutations increasing the hydrophobicity of the protein [51],[54]. Studies using a YF replicon trans-packaging system demonstrated that large deletions in the N and C terminal regions of protein C were tolerated [50]. In the same report, using a YFV infectious clone, it was shown that the C protein with deletions of the &#945;1 helix resulted in small plaque phenotypes, while deletions including &#945;1 and &#945;2 were lethal. Using DENV, we observed that mutations of amino acids L50 or L54 within &#945;2 helix of C greatly decrease viral particle formation. These results are in agreement with a previous study, in which a deletion of residues 42 to 59 in DENV C protein in &#945;2 impaired viral propagation [52].According to our findings, hydrophobic amino acids within the &#945;2 helix in the center of DENV C protein would function as the hepacivirus C- terminus D2 domain in targeting the protein to LDs. We conclude that hepaci- and flaviviruses use distinct structural features of the C protein for subcellular localization, suggesting a convergent evolution of these viral proteins. It remains to be examined whether the pestivirus C proteins also accumulate on LDs.\nBiological significance of LD in DENV replication\nViral infection could modulate a range of host cell functions and usurp the cellular organization to facilitate viral spread. Although viral translation, RNA amplification, and encapsidation must be temporally and spatially regulated in the cytoplasm of the infected cell, the mechanisms by which flaviviruses coordinate these processes are still unclear. Here, we constructed a new genetic tool to dissociate overlapping signals for DENV RNA replication and encapsidation (mDVR, Fig. 6A). This tool allowed us to confirm that complete deletion of the C protein did not alter viral RNA translation or RNA synthesis. The substitution L50S or L54S, which altered C targeting to LDs, resulted in viruses that translated and replicated the RNA efficiently but had defects in infectious particle production (Fig. 6B and C). These viruses released reduced amounts of viral E protein and viral RNA, supporting the idea that C association to LDs is necessary for viral particle formation (Fig. 5). The double mutant (L50S+L54S), which abolished protein association to LDs and impaired viral particle production, was also found to delay amplification of viral RNA (Fig. 6B, Mut &#945;2). It is possible that accumulation of this mutated C protein in the cytoplasm could interact with the viral RNA and interfere with genome amplification. A biological role of LDs as transient depots to store or sequester proteins that are in temporary excess has been previously reported [55]. Sequestration of histones on LDs that are released during development has been demonstrated [55]. Therefore, similarly to that observed with histones, LDs could temporally control viral processes by regulating the availability of the highly basic C protein in the cytoplasm of infected cells. Interestingly, localization of C on LDs was also observed in mosquito cells, suggesting a conserved function of these organelles in viral replication in different hosts.The place and the mechanism by which the C protein recruits the viral RNA to form the nucleocapsid in the infected cell are still unclear. Because a dynamic shift of proteins and lipids between the ER and the LDs has been reported (for review see [30]), it is possible that C is stored on LDs early during infection to be then mobilized to the ER membrane for particle morphogenesis. Alternatively, the genomic RNA could interact with C on the surface of LDs to form the nucleocapsids, which could be then transferred to the ER membrane for new viral particles formation.We observed that DENV infection increases the amount of LDs per cell (Fig. 1C). A recent functional genomic screen revealed a number of genes involved in LD formation and the regulation of their number, morphology, and distribution in the cell [56]. Thus, it will be important to investigate how DENV alters these pathways to increase the formation of new LDs or change the half life of the already existing ones. In addition, it will be interesting to examine the effect of the C protein on the enzymatic activities involved in lipid metabolism that have been found associated to LDs. In the case of HCV, interaction of the C protein with LDs was linked to increased lipid accumulation and hepatic steatosis in transgenic mice [57],[58]. Because liver steatosis has been also observed in DENV-infected mice and fatal cases of DHF in humans [59],[60], it is relevant to investigate a possible correlation between LD accumulation in infected tissues and DENV pathogenesis.The properties of LDs have attracted considerable interest because of the link between enhanced fat storage and human diseases such as obesity, inflammation, and cancer. In recent years different compounds that affect the accumulation and metabolism of LDs have been developed [61]&#8211;[63]. Here, we found that a fatty acid synthase inhibitor (C75) that decreased the amount of LDs in DENV-infected and uninfected cells, also inhibited dengue replication 100 to 1000 fold (Fig. 7B). Using a luciferase DENV reporter system, we observed that C75 did not alter viral entry or viral translation. Although the most pronounced inhibition was observed in the production of infectious viral particle, a low but significant reduction of RNA synthesis was also detected. This effect could be due to alteration of the metabolism of lipids, which are components of the replication complexes. In addition, the decreased amount of LDs observed with C75 could account for the large reduction in viral particles produced.Currently, dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever are a tremendous social and economic burden on the world population. We believe that uncovering molecular details of the DENV life cycle and understanding the host pathogen interaction will aid the search for novel anti-dengue strategies.\nMaterials and Methods\n\nEthics statement\nResearch involving animals was approved by the IACUC of the Leloir Institute fully complying with the National Institute of Health (NIH, USA) guidelines.\nCells and viruses\nBaby hamster kidney cells (BHK-21) were cultured in minimum essential medium alpha supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 &#181;g/ml streptomycin. Human hepatocellular liver carcinoma cell line (HepG2) was cultured in minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 &#181;g/ml streptomycin and 0.01% sodium pyruvate. C6/36 HT mosquito cells from A. albopictus, adapted to grow at 33&#176;C, were cultured in L-15 Medium (Leibovitz) supplemented with 0.3% tryptose phosphate broth, 0.02% glutamine, 1% MEM non-essential amino acids solution and 5% fetal bovine serum. Stocks of DENV serotype 2 16681 were prepared in mosquito C6/36 cells and used to infect the different cell lines as indicated in each case.\nConstruction of recombinant DENVs\nThe desired mutations were introduced in a DENV type 2 cDNA clone [64] (GenBank accession number U87411) by replacing the SacI-SphI fragment of the WT plasmid with the respective fragment derived from an overlapping PCR. The sequence of the oligonucleotides used as primers for all the PCR reactions are listed in Table 1. To generate the plasmids carrying the mutations L50S, L54S, L50S&#8211;L54S, L36S&#8211;L39S and V26S&#8211;L29S, common outside primers 101 and 239 were used. Mutation L50S was generated using the inside primers 1035 and 1036, mutation L54S using primers 1037 and 1038, mutation L50S&#8211;L54S using primers 833 and 832, mutation L36S&#8211;L39S with primers 1050 and 1049, and mutation V26S&#8211;L29S with primers 1054 and 1053.Bicistronic dengue virus reporter constructs (DV-R) containing the reporter Renilla luciferase was previously described [33]. The monocistronic DENV reporter construct was build using a previously described plasmid pD2/ICAflII [35] including an additional NotI restriction site at nucleotide 244 (pD2/ICAflII-NotI). To facilitate insertion of the Renilla luciferase gene (Rluc), we generated an intermediate plasmid derived from pRL-CMV (Promega). Using unique SacI and BstBI restriction sites, we introduced the complete DENV 5&#8242;UTR followed by the first 104 nucleotides of the coding sequence of C, using primers 101 and 7. The resulting plasmid was used to introduce downstream of Rluc the FMDV2A protease coding sequence (QLLNFDLLKLAGDVESNPGP) fused to the capsid protein. The fragment carrying FMDV2A fused to DENV sequences was generated by overlapping PCR using for the first PCR primers 273 and 516, and for the second PCR primers 517 and 241. The overlapping PCR product was digested with SacI-NotI restriction enzymes and introduced into homologous restriction sites within pD2/ICAflII-NotI. To generate mDV-R Mut L50S, mDV-R Mut L54S, and mDV-R Mut L50S&#8211;L54S an overlapping PCR was performed with the common primers 595 and 239. The sense and antisense primers used to generate each of the mutations were the same as described above. For mutant mDV-R &#916;C, a fragment carrying the deletion of mature C protein was generated by overlapping PCR using the following primers: PCR1 primer sense 595 and primer antisense 1030; and PCR2 primer sense 1031 and primer antisense 239. The overlapping PCR product was cloned into the mDV-R cDNA using the unique restriction sites SacI-SphI.\nRNA transcription, transfection, and viral recovery\nWild-type (WT) or mutant DENV plasmids were linearized with XbaI and used as templates for T7 RNA polymerase transcription in the presence of m7GpppA cap analog. RNA transcripts (5 &#181;g) were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) into BHK-21 or HepG2 cells grown in 60-mm-diameter tissue culture dishes. Supernatants were harvested at the indicated times post-transfection and used to quantify infectious DENV particles by plaque assays as previously described [35]. Quantification of viral RNA was performed by real time RT-PCR using TaqMan technology as previously described [35].\nImmunofluorescence assay\nBHK-21, HepG2, and C6/36 cells were seeded into 24-well plates containing glass coverslips. Twenty four hours after, they were infected with a DENV2 stock using a multiplicity of infection of 10. At the indicated times the coverslips were removed and the cells were fixed in paraformaldehyde 4%, sucrose 4%, PBS pH 7.4 at room temperature for 20 minutes. Alternatively, they were fixed in methanol for 20 minutes at &#8722;20&#176;C. Cells were then permeated with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 4 minutes at room temperature. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against C were obtained in our laboratory as describe below. A 1&#8758;1000 dilution of this anti-C antibody in PBS&#8211;0.2% gelatin was used. Goat anti-rabbit IgG Cy3 conjugated (Jackson Immuno Research) were used at 1&#8758;500 dilution. For lipid droplets staining cells were incubated with BODIPY 493/503 (4,4-difluoro 1,3,5,7,8 pentamethyl 4-bora 3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene) (Molecular Probes) at 1&#8758;500 dilution, 1 &#181;M. For detection of ADRP, a commercial mouse monoclonal antibody (ARP American Research Products, Inc) was used 1/100 in PBS-gelatine. Cy5 AffiniPure Donkey Anti-mouse IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoReserch) was used 1/500 in PBS-gelatine. Cells were mounted on glass slides and images were obtained with a Zeiss axioplant confocal microscopy. To maintain the consistency of the green color for the C protein, the color of BODIPY was changed to red. For immunofluorescence of transfected cells, the procedure was the same as the one described for infections.\nPurification of recombinant C protein in \nThe coding sequences of the mature C protein (amino acids 1&#8211;100) were obtained by PCR from the DENV type 2 cDNA clone [64] using the sense primer 487 carrying the restriction site NcoI and the antisense primer 489 with the restriction site BamHI. The PCR product was digested and cloned into the expression vector pET-15b (Novagen). Protein expression was performed in the E. coli strain BL21 Rosetta (DE3)pLysS (Novagen). The bacterial culture was grown at 37&#176;C until OD600&#8202;=&#8202;1, induced with 1 mM IPTG and incubated at 18&#176;C overnight. C protein from soluble fraction was first purified using heparin affinity chromatography, eluted with a gradient from 0.2 M to 2 M of NaCl in 50 mM NaH2PO4 (pH 7.5). Fractions containing the protein were collected and further purified by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 75 column (GE Healthcare). Highly purified fractions of C protein were aliquoted and stored at &#8722;70&#176;C in eluted buffer containing 200 mM NaH2PO4 (pH 6) and 500 mM NaCl. Polyclonal antibodies were obtained by inoculating rabbits three times with 0.2 mg of the purified C protein with Freund's adjuvant (SIGMA). Four days before sacrificing the animals, a booster of C without the adjuvant was injected. The antibodies obtained were evaluated for specificity using western blots and ELISA employing infected and non-infected BHK cell extracts and supernatants.\nEukaryotic expression of mature C protein\nThe coding sequences of the mature C protein (amino acids 1 to 100) derived from DENV type 2 were obtained by PCR using the sense primer 947 carrying the restriction site AflII and the antisense primer 489 with the restriction site BamHI. The PCR product was digested and cloned in the eukaryotic expression plasmid pcDNA6/V5-HisB (Invitrogen). Purified plasmid (2 &#181;g) was transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) into BHK-21 cells grown in 24-well plates containing a 1-cm2 coverslip. At different time points after transfection the coverslips were fixed and directly used for IFA.\nLipid droplet counting\nCells were fixed as described for the immunofluorescence assay and then treated as follows: rinsed in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, incubated with 1.5% OsO4 (30 min), rinsed in H2O, immersed in 1.0% thiocarbohydrazide (5 min), rinsed in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, incubated in 1.5% OsO4 (3 min), rinsed in distilled water, and then dried for further analyses. The morphology of fixed cells was observed, and lipid droplets were enumerated by light microscopy with &#215;100 objective lens. The total amount of lipid droplets was counted in 50 consecutive cells. For each determination the experiment was done in triplicates.\nIsolation of lipid droplets by subcellular fractionation\nLipid droplets were isolated by sucrose gradients as we previously described [41]. Briefly, DENV infected BHK cells in 20 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 100 mM KCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing a protease inhibitors cocktail were disrupted by nitrogen cavitation at 700&#968; for 5 min at 4&#176;C and collected in an equal volume of buffer containing 1.08 M sucrose. The homogenates were centrifuged to remove the nucleus and the supernatant were overlaid with 2 ml each of 0.27 M sucrose buffer, 0.13 M sucrose buffer, and top buffer (25 mM Tris HCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM EGTA). The gradient was centrifuged at 250,000 g 1 h at 4&#176;C. The fractions collected from the top contained LD, cytosol, microsomal fraction, and pellet. Proteins from these fractions were precipitated overnight with TCA, washed with cold acetone, and analyzed by western blot using anti-C and anti-ADRP (guinea pig anti- ADRP polyclonal antibodies, Research Diagnostics Inc., Flanders, NJ). The activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was measured using the CytoTox 96 kit (Promega) to discard cytosolic contamination in the LD fraction.\nRNA-binding assays\nThe interaction of the C protein with RNA was analyzed by filter-binding assays (FBA). Uniformly 32P-labeled RNA probe corresponding to the viral 5&#8242; terminal region (nucleotides 1&#8211;160) was obtained by in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase and purified on 5% poly-acrylamide gels&#8211;6 M urea. The binding reactions contained 50 mM NaH2PO4 (pH 6), 150 mM NaCl, 0.02% tween 20, 0.1 nM 32P-labeled probe, and increasing concentrations of C protein (0, 3.75, 7.5, 15, 30, 60, 125, 250, 500, and 1000 nM). For FBA, Nitrocellulose (Protran BA 85, Whatman-Schleider& Schuell) and Hybond N+ nylon (Amersham Bioscience) membranes were pre-soaked in binding buffer 50 mM NaH2PO4 (pH 6), 150 mM NaCl, 0.02% tween 20 and assembled in a dot-blot apparatus. A 20-&#181;L aliquot of each protein&#8211;RNA mixture was applied to the filters and rinsed with 100 &#181;L of binding buffer. Membranes were air-dried and visualized by PhosphoImaging analysis. The macroscopic binding constants were estimated by nonlinear regression (Sigma Plot), fitting Equation 1: Bound %&#8202;=&#8202;Boundmax&#183;[Prot]/(Kd+[Prot]), where Bound % is the percentage of bound RNA, Boundmax is the maximal percentage of RNA competent for binding, [Prot] is the concentration of purified C protein, and Kd is the apparent dissociation constant.\nDetermination of C protein molecular weight by Static Light Scattering (SLS)\nThe average molecular weight (MW) of the proteins was determined on a Precision Detector PD2010 light-scattering instrument tandemly connected to an FPLC system and a LKB 2142 differential refractometer. Five hundred &#181;l of C protein (1 mg/ml) were loaded on a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 (24 ml) column, size exclusion was performed at 0.4 mL/min with a running buffer of 200 mM NaH2PO4 (pH 6.0) and 500 mM NaCl. The 90&#176; light scattering, refractive index, and absorbance of the eluting material were recorded on a PC computer and analyzed with the Discovery32 software supplied by Precision Detectors. The 90&#176; light scattering detector was calibrated using BSA as a standard.\nStudies with the inhibitor C75\nThe compound C75, a fatty acid synthase (FAS) inhibitor, was purchased from Cayman chemicals. For lipid droplet enumeration in the presence of C75, 5.0&#215;104 BHK-21 cells were seeded per well in 24-well plates containing a 1 cm2 coverslip and allowed to attach overnight. Cells were mock-infected or DENV-infected (MOI of 10). The inoculum was removed 1 h post-infection and 0.5 ml of fresh medium supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum was added in the presence of 0, 5, 10, or 20 &#181;M of C75. At the indicated time points post-infection, the slides were fixed and directly used for lipid droplet enumeration. Cell viability in the presence of C75 was determined by MTS assay (Cell titer 96&#174;Aqueous Non-Radioactive Cell proliferation Assay, Promega). To evaluate the effect of C75 on DENV replication, the above protocol was used and the supernatants harvested at 24 and 48 h post-infection were used for virus quantification by plaque assay. For studies using the reporter virus carrying luciferase, a viral stock of mDV-R was first prepared by RNA transfection of BHK cells. This stock was used to infect cells in the presence of 0, 10, or 20 &#181;M of C75. Luciferase activity was evaluated at 10, 24 and 48 h post-infection. After 48 h of infection, the supernatant was collected and used to evaluate the release of mDV-R particles by infecting fresh BHK cells in the absence of C75. Luciferase activity was then measured 48 h after infection.", "pmid": "19851456", "title": "Dengue Virus Capsid Protein Usurps Lipid Droplets for Viral Particle Formation", "journal_title": "PLoS Pathogens", "authors": "Marcelo M.

Data were analyzed using the unpaired Student t test, with values of P<0.05 considered significant.Results:\nMean patient age was 39 years (range, 6 to 79) in Group I and 45 years (range, 13 to 77) in Group II. Total operative time was 151 minutes in Group I and 159 minutes in Group II (NS), estimated blood loss averaged 544 mm in Group I and 308mm in Group II (P=0.015).

Over the last decade, laparoscopic splenectomy (LS) has grown from novelty to the surgical procedure of choice for many diseases affecting the spleen. The response rates of hematologic diseases to LS are similar to those of historical controls who underwent open splenectomy.3,4 Compared with open splenectomy, however, LS is associated with decreased intraoperative blood loss, less postoperative pain, and a shorter hospital stay.5&#8211;7The first laparoscopic splenectomy at the University of Maryland was performed in early 1992, shortly after Delaitre and Maignien's initial report. Little long-term perioperative data are available for LS, because few institutions have performed the procedure for more than a few years. We examined the 10-year, single-institution experience with LS at a university teaching hospital to determine trends in the operative technique, patient outcome, and indications for laparoscopic splenectomy.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nLaparoscopic splenectomy has been performed at the University of Maryland since March 1992. Since the inception of LS, all patients were enrolled in a prospective, longitudinal database. Perioperative parameters were assessed, including patient age and sex, surgical indication for splenectomy, need for conversion to open splenectomy, estimated blood loss, requirement for blood product transfusion, spleen specimen weight, pre- and postoperative hematocrit and platelet levels, time to oral intake, length of hospital stay, and perioperative morbidity or mortality. Additional information was obtained by direct patient interview or review of medical records when necessary.Since the annual number of LS was relatively constant during the 10-year study period, patients were arbitrarily separated into 2 cohorts to study the effect of institutional experience on outcome. The first consecutive 55 patients (Group I) undergoing LS were compared with the subsequent 54 patients (Group II). The 2 groups were equally matched with respect to age, sex, and indication for splenectomy. Patient demographics are detailed in Table 1.Preoperative preparation was individualized. All patients received polyvalent Streptococcus pneumoniae vaccination before surgery. Some patients also received vaccination against Hemophilus influenzae. Transfusion of blood products, such as platelets, packed red blood cells, or gamma globulin, was performed at the discretion of the referring hematologist, attending surgeon, or anesthesiologist. Routine preoperative imaging to determine splenic size or the presence of accessory splenic tissue was not performed. Preoperative angiographic embolization was not used in any patient during the study.The operative technique of LS evolved over the 10-year period. The procedure was performed with the patient in the supine position in the first 27 patients, the so-called &#8220;anterior approach.&#8221;6 Gradual adoption of the lateral approach to LS occurred due to the institution's large and successful experience with laparoscopic donor nephrectomy. The lateral approach to LS has been used exclusively for the past 7 years.Briefly, the patient is positioned in the right decubitus position. Care is taken to ensure proper support and padding of the patient's head, neck, and lower extremities. Both the operating surgeon and camera operator stand on the right side of the operating table. Three or 4 operating ports are placed after a pneumoperitoneum is created (Figure 1). The initial 5-mm port (A) is placed lateral to the rectus sheath approximately 1 cm to 2 cm above the umbilicus. Port B (5 mm) is placed immediately below the left costal margin in the midclavicular line, and port C (15 mm) is placed 8 cm to 10 cm below the left costal margin in the anterior axillary line. An additional port (D, 5 mm) is often used to aid with retraction of the splenic hilum or suctioning the operative field in cases when significant splenomegaly is present. A 5-mm, 30-degree, angled laparoscope is placed into port B, and the operating surgeons left- and right-handed instruments are inserted through port A and port C, respectively. The operative dissection is determined to some extent by the size, configuration, and consistency of the spleen, as well as the indication for splenectomy. The first step is usually a thorough search for accessory splenic tissue, focused on the hilum, omentum, and lesser sac. Dissection generally begins with division of the splenocolic attachments and dissection of the medial aspect of the spleen in a cephalad direction. The inferior pole splenic vessels are clipped or divided with an ultrasonic scalpel. Blunt dissection on the anterior and posterior aspects of the hilum is undertaken to the extent the anatomy will allow. The hilar structures, including the splenic artery and vein are ligated en masse with an endoscopic linear stapler. The gastrosplenic ligament and short gastric vessels are then divided using either an ultrasonic scalpel or endoscopic linear stapler. Finally, the lateral attachments of the spleen are divided, and the spleen is placed into a large specimen retrieval sac inserted through the 15-mm port. Extraction of the spleen from the abdominal cavity is facilitated by use of a ringed forceps or other clamp to fracture and morcellate the specimen after the retrieval sac is partially exteriorized. Occasionally, it is necessary to enlarge the 15-mm skin excision.Postoperatively, patients are monitored for pain control, ability to resume oral intake, and the occurrence of complications. The hematologic response to splenectomy is also monitored, though it is usually too soon to determine whether a positive therapeutic response to splenectomy has occurred by the time of discharge. Patients are discharged when they are fully able to tolerate a liquid diet and their pain is adequately controlled with oral analgesics. All patients are followed in the surgeon's office 10 days to 14 days after discharge.\nRESULTS\nFrom March 1992 to November 2001, LS was performed in 109 consecutive, unselected patients with benign or malignant hematological diseases. The indications for splenectomy are listed in Table 2. Laparoscopic splenectomy was successfully performed in 48 of 55 patients (87%) in Group I and 53 of 54 patients (98%) in Group II. Conversion to open splenectomy (Figure 2) occurred in 7of 55 patients (13%) in Group I and 1 of 54 patients (2%) in Group II (P=0.03). Excessive bleeding was the indication for conversion of 6/7 patients in Group I and the single conversion in Group II. An additional patient in Group I with Hodgkin's disease undergoing a staging procedure required conversion to laparotomy. The laparoscopic procedure was converted to an open procedure to better facilitate mesenteric and periaortic lymph node dissection.Perioperative data are expressed in Table 3. Although the mean operative time did not decrease over the years, operative blood loss significantly decreased in patients in Group I compared with those in Group II (P=0.015). Splenic specimen weight significantly increased over the last decade. Mean specimen weight was 288&#177;44 g in Group I and 512&#177;74 g in Group II (P=0.03). No significant difference existed between Groups I and II with respect to time to resumption of oral intake or length of hospital stay.Postoperative morbidity was 13% in Group I and 9% in Group II (Table 4). Perioperative arrhythmia necessitating intensive care unit monitoring occurred in 4 patients (2 from each group). Additional complications included left lower lobe pneumonia (2 patients), superficial wound infection at the extraction site (2 patients), ileus (defined as no return of bowel function for >48 hours after surgery), subphrenic abscess, and an abdominal wall hematoma at the extraction site. No significant difference existed in morbidity between Groups I and II.Mortality occurred in 1/109 patient (1%), as a result of overwhelming postsplenectomy infection (OPSI). The patient was a 33-year-old female who underwent LS in 1994 (Group I) for refractory thrombocytopenia of an uncertain cause. Her past medical history was also significant for primary pulmonary hypertension. She developed a fever approximately 48 hours after an uneventful surgical procedure. Despite empiric broad-spectrum parenteral antibiotic therapy, clinical deterioration occurred with rapid onset of anuria and refractory hypotension. She succumbed on postoperative day 8. The cause of death was Staphylococcus aureus sepsis from a central venous catheter introducer through which a pulmonary artery catheter was placed for intraoperative hemodynamic monitoring.\nDISCUSSION\nLaparoscopic splenectomy has become the gold standard for the elective treatment of many diseases of the spleen. Although several studies document the safety and efficacy of LS, no large, single-institution analysis has been performed to date. Accordingly, several interesting observations can be drawn from this study.Most importantly, LS was performed with acceptable morbidity throughout the 10-year study period, despite the unselected nature of the series and inclusion of patients with significant comorbidities. The overall complication rate was 11% for the entire series and only 9% over the last 5 years (Group II). The nature of the complications was typical after splenectomy (wound infection, subphrenic abscess, left-sided pulmonary complications), though the incidence of arrhythmia was somewhat higher than anticipated. These data compare favorably with data from the largest series of LS published to date. Park examined 200 patients from 2 different institutions who underwent LS from 1993 through 2000. Overall morbidity was 9.3%, and no perioperative mortality occurred.8The 1 death in this series deserves special attention. The patient expired after a rapid, fulminant course of gram-positive bacterial septicemia, a clinical picture very consistent with overwhelming postsplenectomy infection (OPSI). This is one of the first deaths from OPSI reported after LS. The incidence of OPSI is typically quoted as approximately 3.2%, with an overall mortality of 1.4%.9 However, the mortality rate is as high as 17% when bacteremia occurs in an asplenic individual in the immediate postoperative period.10 Unfortunately, current data regarding the epidemiology of OPSI were generated during the era of open splenectomy. It is not clear whether the incidence of OPSI after LS in 2003 is equal to that after open splenectomy from 1960 to 1990. Perioperative care now includes widespread preoperative polymicrobial vaccination and improved antibiotic therapy. It is also not clear whether the lesser insult to the immune system seen after laparoscopic procedures translates into any clinical benefit. Further study in this area is necessary. In any case, it is important to realize that in asplenic individuals who are immunized against Streptococcus pneumoniae, the likelihood of identifying this pathogen as the cause of a septic process is unlikely.10Examination of intraoperative variables in this series reveals mixed results. A clear trend exists toward successful performance of LS in patients with larger spleens, lower blood loss, and acceptable morbidity. However, operative times were not significantly improved over the 10-year period. In addition, technical improvements did not seem to result in earlier discharge from the hospital or more rapid resumption of a diet. A number of possible explanations exist for these observations.Multiple factors influence the operative times during laparoscopic splenectomy, including surgeon experience, indication for the procedure, the presence of surgical trainees, and patient factors such as the presence of coagulation defects or prior upper abdominal surgical procedures. Examination of these variables may suggest why the mean operative times did not decrease over the last decade. First, referral patterns from surrounding hematologists changed over the 10-year period. As surgeons and referring physicians gained confidence, patients with increasingly larger spleens and more complex medical conditions were seen. The number of LS performed for idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (where spleen size is usually normal) has dramatically decreased, whereas the number of LS performed for secondary hypersplenism and hematological malignancies has increased. Secondly, operative times in teaching institutions tend to be cyclical. During the early University of Maryland experience with LS, 2 attending surgeons routinely performed the procedure. Surgical fellows and residents enjoyed an increased level of participation once the attending faculty had mastered the technique. Though operative times are decreased by improved surgical instrumentation and attending surgeon experience, these improvements tend to be offset by increased participation of trainees. Therefore, operative times at teaching institutions are not likely to change for the next several years.Despite the fact that specimen weight in this series increased over time, a concomitant decrease occurred in operative blood loss. Reasons for this observation are complex and include better instrumentation and operative technique, and increased surgeon experience. Data during open splenectomy suggest that spleen weight is directly proportional to blood loss.11 Operative data for LS in patients with larger spleens is particularly interesting. The average specimen in this series weighed 512 g (normal splenic weight, 150 to 300) during the past 5 years. Several specimens weighed more than 2000 g. Despite the increased technical difficulty posed by splenomegaly, LS was accomplished in a timely fashion in these patients (mean operative time, 159 minutes), with minimal blood loss (mean blood loss, 308 mL) and only 1 conversion to open splenectomy. Kercher et al12 recently reported similar results for LS in patients with massive splenomegaly. In their series, &#8220;massive splenomegaly&#8221; was defined as splenic weight greater than 600g. The mean operative blood loss was 114 mL, mean operative time was 171 minutes, and no conversions to laparotomy were necessary. When this same group of surgeons compared LS in patients with splenomegaly (defined as splenic weight greater than 500 g) to LS in patients with normal-sized spleens, they noted longer operative times and increased blood loss in patients with splenomegaly.13 A higher rate of conversion did not occur in their patients with splenomegaly. However, Terrosu et al14 noted that when LS was performed in patients with spleens larger than 2000 g, a higher rate of conversion to laparotomy, an increased amount of blood loss, and a longer hospital stay occurred compared with LS performed in patients with smaller spleens.The declining rate of conversion of LS to open splenectomy in this series is also multifactorial. Better equipment is partially responsible by allowing less operative hemorrhage through improved hemostasis and less tissue trauma during exposure and retraction. However, the institutional learning curve is probably the most important factor. As attending surgeons gain experience with LS, their operative decision-making and level of comfort is improved. Previous studies have correlated the likelihood of conversion of LS to open splenectomy with increasing blood loss and spleen size.15 During the first 5 years of our study, 13% of the procedures were converted to laparotomy, mostly due to excessive bleeding. However, over the past 5 years, only 1 conversion has been necessary (2%). Park8 noted a similar institutional trend. While his overall conversion rate was 3%, over his last 160 procedures, only 1.2% was converted to open splenectomy.\nCONCLUSION\nThese data represent a decade of experience with LS, which can be performed safely for a wide variety of indications. Over the last 10 years, the average spleen size has increased, yet a significant reduction in blood loss and conversion rate has been achieved.", "pmid": "15984703", "title": "A Ten-year, Single Institution Experience With Laparoscopic Splenectomy", "journal_title": "JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons", "authors": "Robert L.

Such data are needed to inform prevention and public health policy.Methods\nThis community-based, cross-sectional study combined oral fluid HIV testing with an electronic behavioral survey. Adopting a two-stage time location sampling HIV prevalence estimates for a representative sample of adult sub-Saharan African migrants in Antwerp, Belgium were obtained. Sample proportions and estimated adjusted population proportions were calculated for all variables. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis explored factors independently associated with HIV infection.Results\nBetween December 2013 and October 2014, 744 sub-Saharan African migrants were included (37% women). A substantial proportion was socially, legally and economically vulnerable: 21% were probably of undocumented status, 63% had financial problems in the last year and 9% lacked stable housing. Sexual networks were mostly African and crossed national borders, i.e. sexual encounters during travels within Europa and Africa. Concurrency is common, 34% of those in a stable relationship had a partner on the side in the last year. HIV prevalence was 5.9%(95%CI:3.4%-10.1%) among women and 4.2% (95%CI:1.6%-10.6%) among men. Although high lifetime HIV testing was reported at community level (73%), 65.2% (CI95%:32.4%-88.0%) of sub-Saharan African migrants were possibly undiagnosed. Being 45 years or older, unprotected sex when travelling within Europe in the last year, high intentions to use condoms, being unaware of their last sexual partners&#8217; HIV status, recent HIV testing and not having encountered partner violence in the last year were independently associated with HIV infection in multivariable logical regression. In univariable analysis, HIV infection was additionally associated to unemployment.Conclusions\nThis is the first HIV prevalence study among adult sub-Saharan African migrants resettling in a European city based on a representative sample. HIV prevalence was high and could potentially increase further due to the high number of people with an undiagnosed HIV infection, social vulnerability, high levels of concurrency and mainly African sexual networks. Given this population&#8217;s mobility, an aligned European combination prevention approach addressing these determinants is urgently needed.", "body": "Introduction\nMigrants from high endemic regions, including those from sub-Saharan Africa are the second largest group affected by HIV/AIDS in the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and a priority group for HIV prevention. In 2014, 13.8% of new HIV diagnoses in EU/EEA Member states were among sub-Saharan African migrants [1]. Since 2005, surveillance data show a decreasing trend of HIV diagnoses among this group [1, 2]. It is unclear how to interpret this trend. Potential explanations refer to a truly decreasing incidence, changes in migration flows or lower uptake of HIV testing as a result of toughening immigration laws and restricted access to health care and social rights [2]. Consequently, surveillance data provide little indications for prevention planning. While there is a pressing need for tailored and targeted interventions aiming to prevent new HIV infections since increasing evidence is showing that sub-Saharan African migrants are acquiring HIV in Europe [3].HIV prevalence estimates could serve as a complementary indicator of the HIV burden, besides the numbers of newly reported HIV diagnoses, and could guide prevention planning. Currently such HIV prevalence estimates are only available for the United Kingdom: mathematical modelling estimated that among 15&#8211;44 year old black heterosexual Africans 17.9 per 1,000 men and 43.7 per 1,000 women were living with HIV in 2014 [4]. For other European countries few HIV prevalence estimates are available, but they are not representative. The Mayisha II study, conducted in 2004 in London, Luton and the West-Midlands reported an overall prevalence of 14%, 15% among women and 13.1% among men. This study might have oversampled HIV positive people by using a convenience sample of recruitment sites [5,6]. In other prevalence studies, sub-Saharan African migrants were a sub-group amongst other target groups, such as migrant female sex workers [7], recently arrived migrants [8], attendees of a tropical medicine referral unit [9] or were studied in combination with other ethnic minorities [10].Several reasons may account for the lack of representative HIV prevalence estimates for sub-Saharan African migrant residing in Europe. First, sub-Saharan African migrant communities are small but heterogeneous in terms of their national, ethnic and cultural backgrounds, migration patterns, residence status, educational and socio-economic backgrounds, and religious beliefs [11]. These different communities all have their particular characteristics and distinct meeting places, which makes it difficult for obtaining a sound representative sample of sub-Saharan African migrants. Second, researchers and funders may have been reluctant to conduct such studies due to concerns of reiterating the persisting HIV related stigma and discrimination among these communities and further contributing to general xenophobia [11,12]. Finally, because the HIV epidemic among migrants in Europe was long considered an imported one, research and prevention efforts were mostly focused on early linkage to care through promotion of HIV testing and counseling [3, 12]. This perception recently changed with increasing evidence of HIV acquisition in Europe [3]. The aMASE study, conducted in nine European countries, showed that 31% of HIV infected Africans acquired HIV while living in European host countries, underlining the renewed need for primary prevention [13]. To inform interventions aiming to prevent new HIV infections among sub-Saharan African migrants in Europe, HIV prevalence studies are needed to understand the magnitude of the epidemic and the risk for onwards transmission.As for Europe in general, the HIV epidemic among sub-Saharan African migrants in Belgium, the country of our study, has not been well described. People with a sub-Saharan African nationality accounted for 29% of new HIV diagnoses reported in 2014, 30% less than in 2012 [14]. It is unclear whether this reflects a declining epidemic, reduced HIV testing uptake, or changing migration patterns [2]. HIV testing uptake may have been affected by the increased restrictions to access health care for undocumented migrants [15]. However, the number of late HIV diagnoses (at < 350 CD4/mm3) among patients with a sub-Saharan African nationality remained stable at around 50% in the last years [14]. The impact of restrictive migration laws on HIV surveillance trends [2], and the number of undiagnosed HIV are difficult to establish, since accurate population size estimates of sub-Saharan African migrants are not available. Officially 175,000 people who are born in a sub-Saharan African country are registered in Belgium. This is an underestimation, as people of undocumented status, sub-Saharan African migrants who obtained Belgian nationality, and second and third generation migrants are not included in this number. Also the increased mobility of migrants since the recent economic crisis is not accounted for in official population numbers [15]. Sub-Saharan African migrants who moved from other European countries to Belgium in search for job opportunities quickly become part of the local sexual networks [16], and this may also influence the Belgian HIV epidemic. Therefore, the present study&#8217;s objective was to obtain sound HIV prevalence estimates and to identify sub-groups that should be prioritized for HIV prevention through studying a representative sample of the heterogeneous sub-Saharan African migrant communities present in Antwerp city (i.e. the largest Flemish city\nMethods\nWe conducted a cross-sectional community-based survey combining biological and behavioral data using a two-stage time location sampling. The study design was informed by three formative sub-studies and adopted a community based participatory research approach [17,18,19].\nCommunity based participatory research approach\nTo assure acceptability, a Community Advisory Board was set up and a team of community researchers engaged. This team of nine lay people of sub-Saharan African origin reflected the communities&#8217; diversity in terms of origin, educational background and migration status. In line with GIPA principles [20], sub-Saharan African migrants living with HIV were also included in the team. They were involved in every step of the research process and received training and continuous coaching from the first author throughout the study to ensure data rigor [18].\nStudy population and sampling frame\nOfficially about 17,000 people of sub-Saharan African origin are living in Antwerp city, which, however, excludes people of undocumented status and mobile groups. About 11,000 of them are adults (i.e. 18 years or older) and almost half (47%) originate from three countries: The Democratic Republic of the Congo (18.8%), Ghana (17.5%) and Nigeria (10.7%). In addition, 43 other nationalities are living in the Antwerp city area.To include a representative sample of the diverse communities of sub-Saharan African migrants, including hard to-reach groups like undocumented migrants and mobile populations, we opted for time location sampling. This method takes into account that some hard-to-reach populations tend to gather and can be reached at certain types of locations [21]. To construct the sampling frame we conducted a formative study. Between June 2012 and June 2013, community settings frequented by sub-Saharan African migrants in Antwerp city were systematically mapped using an adaptation of the PLACE Method Approach [17]. The community researchers interviewed a total of 223 adults knowledgeable about the communities&#8217; social meeting places. After reaching saturation, community researchers visited all identified sites for a verification interview. We assessed the busiest moments, and the number of people usually present during these times per site to allow proportion-to-size sampling. The obtained sampling frame consisted of a list of 169 community settings: bars, churches, events and meetings of African organisations, public places (like squares, parks and street corners), hairdressing salons and shops.\nSample size and sampling method\nThe sampling size was calculated to detect an HIV prevalence of 4%, with a precision of 2% and a type I error (alpha) of 0.05. We assumed the study design effect of the cluster sampling to be 2, resulting in a required sample size of 714 sub-Saharan African migrants.A two-stage time location sampling was used to recruit the required number of study participants. First, 51 clusters or settings, were selected with a probability proportion-to-size from the sampling frame. If a selected setting was unavailable or declined, we documented this and selected the next setting on the list. In a second step we randomly selected 14 participants present at the setting at the time of data collection. If the target of 14 participants could not be reached at the first visit, up to three study visits were made to the same setting until the desired number of participants was achieved.\nInclusion criteria\nAll people socializing in a given setting at the time of the study visit were eligible for inclusion if they met the following criteria: (1) self-identified sub-Saharan African migrant, (2) age 18 years or above, (3) accepting to answer the questionnaire, (4) accepting to donate an oral fluid sample, (5) providing written informed consent. Each person could participate only once in the study.\nData collection procedures\nStandard Operating Procedures (SOPs) were developed in collaboration with the community researchers, the community advisory board and the AIDS reference laboratory at the Institute of Tropical Medicine. These SOPs were refined after two pilots. At pre-arranged moments the study team visited the settings and randomly selected 14 persons. The procedures were setting-specific depending on type of venue. For instance, in churches each community researcher was assigned randomly to a row of chairs and they invited everybody sitting in that row to participate. In bars or at meetings, tables were assigned at random. At parties, public events or in public places, randomly assigned walking lines were followed. In settings with few people present, everybody was selected.The community researchers presented themselves to potential study respondents, introduced the study, its objectives and methods stressing anonymity and voluntary nature of participation. Community researchers explicitly mentioned that everybody was invited to participate, regardless of their HIV status in order to avoid self-exclusion of HIV positive people.People interested to participate received more detailed information on the procedures and were asked to sign the informed consent form. Upon signing, they self-completed an electronic behavioral questionnaire (surveyTo Go, www.dooblo.net) on a 7-inch tablet. To build confidence and ensure data rigor, a short tutorial on how to handle the tablet was integrated. It gave special attention to anonymizing aspects of the data collection. If needed, community researchers offered discrete assistance to fill in the questionnaire. Next, participants were asked to self-collect an oral fluid sample for HIV testing. The collected samples were put in a dry tube and stored in a closed envelope together with the other data sources. A unique code linked the informed consent, questionnaire, oral fluid sample, and a result recollection letter. Participants could obtain their HIV test result by calling the study nurse and providing their unique study code if they wanted to learn their results.Finally, community researchers collected attendance data. They asked Participants in a uniform way how often they had visited the study setting in the last month. As a token of appreciation participants received free condoms, an information brochure on HIV testing and &#8364; 5,-. Those who refused received the same, except for the financial compensation. Limited data on decliners&#8217; sociodemographic characteristics and reasons of refusal were recorded. Since it was not feasible to ask decliners about their age or country of origin, these data were provided based on community researchers&#8217; assumptions.\nLaboratory methods\nThe main outcome measure was HIV status. It was established using the oral fluid specimens. Within seven days of collecting the sample, the AIDS reference laboratory performed the analysis according to a validated algorithm [22]. First, samples were tested with a Genscreen HIV &#189; v2&#174; (BioRad, Sensitivity = 100, 95% CI: 95.9&#8211;100; Specificity = 97.6, 95% CI: 94.5&#8211;99.0). If reactive, a second HIV ELISA test, Vironostika HIV Ag/Ab (BioM&#233;rieux, Sensitivity = 97.8, 95% CI: 92.3&#8211;99.4; Specificity = 100, 95% CI: 98.2&#8211;100) was performed. Only participants with two reactive test results were considered to be HIV infected. The quality of the oral fluid samples was measured for all negative samples using an IgG ELISA quantification kit (Human Total IgG ELISA, Immunology Consultants Laboratory, Inc., cat. No: E-80G). Samples with insufficient IgG were considered non-valid and excluded from analysis.\nStatistical analysis\nAll data were merged, cleaned and analyzed using SPSS Statistics 23 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, US). In a first step we calculated simple sample proportions of relevant variables. Next, we estimated adjusted population proportions [23] using the complex samples module of SPSS. This module allowed us to account for the design specifications of time-location sampling, e.g. unequal probability of selection and clustering (e.g. individuals selected from the same venue tend to behave in a similar way) [24]. To account for the unequal probability of selection, weighting factors were calculated taking into account the probability that a given participant was in the setting at the time of the study (calculated based on the attendance data, see above), the probability of accepting participation taking into account age and setting (obtained from a logistical model with participation as dependent variable and age and setting as independent variables) and the sampling fraction (e.g. number of participants/ total number of sub-Saharan African migrants present in the study setting at the time of the study) [24]. To account for the cluster design characteristics in the point estimates, variances of parameter estimates were computed according to the Taylor linearization method as presented by Binder [25]. The study venue was defined as the unit of clustering. Both weighting factors and clusters were included into the SPSS Complex samples plan file to estimate population proportions and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of socio-demographic characteristic, migration factors, sexual behavior and sexual health. For these variables, a Chi-square was calculated to analyze for differences in gender.The SPSS Complex samples module and plan file was also used to conduct a univariable and multivariable analysis. HIV status was considered the dependent variable. Independent variables included socio-demographic variables, migration, sexual behavior and sexual health factors. The strength of the association was measured by the Odds ratio. Variables associated in univariable analysis with p<0.1 were included in the multivariable logistic regression analysis. A p<0.05 in multivariate analysis was considered statistically significant.\nEthical approval\nEthical approval was obtained of the Institutional Review Board of the Institute of Tropical Medicine and the Ethical committee of the University Hospital Antwerp.\nResults\nBetween December 13th, 2013 and August 31st, 2014 we conducted 77 data collection visits to 51 cluster settings spread over nine districts of Antwerp city. This included fourteen activities of socio-cultural organizations of sub-Saharan African migrants, twelve churches, ten bars, seven public places, two shops, two hairdressing salons, an asylum center and a public library. In total, 1250 potential participants were approached, of whom 753 accepted (see Fig 1). A non-response analysis showed no differences regarding gender between those who participated and those who declined. People of older age were more likely to decline participation than those estimated to be 18&#8211;25; and those approached in churches or African organization meetings were more likely to participate when compared with those approached in public spaces. Not having time was the most frequently mentioned reason for non-participation. Below the population estimates of 725 participants are presented.\nSocio-demographic and migration related characteristics\nSelected background characteristics are shown in Tables 1 and 2. More men (63.1%) than women participated in the study. Participants were between 18 and 82 years old, with a mean age of 34.5 years. Seventy-nine percent were residents of Antwerp city.Sub-Saharan African migrants socializing in Antwerp city had diverse ethnic backgrounds, and reported different migration status and living situations. They originated from 35 different sub-Saharan African countries, with the largest groups being from Nigeria (24.9%), Democratic Republic of the Congo (16.9%), Cameroon (14.9%) and Ghana (12.0%). About one forth (24.1%) were recent migrants, and 37.5% were established migrants (living more than 10 years in Belgium or born there). One fifth (21.1%) did not have health insurance, which served as a proxy for an undocumented status. Many sub-Saharan African migrants had already migrated within Africa (24.7%) or Europe (31.7%) before arriving in Belgium and continued to be mobile after settling in Belgium.About half (47.6%) of the sub-Saharan African migrants, significantly more men than women, were working or self-employed at the time of the study. Financial problems were prevalent, with almost two third (63.4%) reporting financial problems in the last year. Likewise, 8.8% did not have stable housing (i.e. homeless or living with friends).\nSexual behavior and sexual health\nEighty-seven percent were sexually active in the last year. The majority preferred sexual partners of the opposite sex (92.9%) and of sub-Saharan African origin (73.0%). Sixty-two percent were currently married or in a relationship, and 69.4% of them were co-habiting. The median number of sexual partners in the last year was one, but significantly more men than women reported multiple partners and concurrency during the last year. Nearly forty percent (39.8%) of men in a relationship had other sexual partner(s) besides their stable partner in this time period. In addition, about one third (33.8%) assumed that their partner also had other sex partners in the last year.Reduced sexual agency was common among both male and female sub-Saharan African migrants in Antwerp: 7.2% reported having sex with someone in exchange for gifts, food, money, papers or housing and emotional, 7.4% encountered physical violence by a partner and 1.8% were forced to have sex in the last year. One in ten (10,5%) women had been forced to have sex in their lifetime.Thirty percent of sub-Saharan African migrants reported sexual encounters when travelling to Africa and within Europe, mostly with local sexual partners. Of them, two third (65.5%) reported using a condom at their last sexual encounter abroad. In general, 32.3% reported using a condom at last sexual contact. Four out of five (79.1%) reported that they are likely to use a condom with a future new partner, especially men have high condom intentions.The reported degree of lifetime HIV testing was high (73.0%), and 40.4% of the total population were tested in the last year. Sixty percent reported to be aware of their last sexual partners&#8217; HIV status. In the last year, 3.5% were diagnosis with a sexually transmitted infection (STI) other than HIV. Fourteen percent ever had an STI, significantly more men than women. More details can be found in Table 3 and Table 4.\nHIV prevalence\nThirty-two oral fluid samples were reactive to both tests resulting into an HIV prevalence estimation of 5.9% (95%CI:3.4%-10.1%) among women and 4.2% (95%CI:1.6%-10.6%) among men. Twenty among the 32 persons found HIV positive did not report their HIV status in the questionnaire, and therefore 65.2% (CI95%:32.4%-88.0%) were likely to be undiagnosed. Of the 12 persons, who reported their positive HIV status, ten were currently taking antiretroviral medication. Four HIV positive participants reported they were diagnosed with an STI in the last year, three of them were possibly undiagnosed. All HIV positive persons who reported unprotected sex when travelling in Europe did not report their HIV status. They had sex with a stable partner of sub-Saharan African origin who lives in another European country.Factors associated with an HIV infection are presented in Table 5. In univariable analyses, HIV infection was associated with being unemployed (OR 2.59), no partner violence in the last year (OR 9.00), intention to use a condom with a future new partner (OR 3.85), unprotected sex when travelling within Europe in the last year (OR 6.53) and being unaware of their last sexual partners&#8217; HIV status (OR3.70).In multivariable analyses, older age (45 years and older vs. 18 to 25 years), no partner violence in the last year, high intentions to use condoms, unprotected sex when travelling within Europe in the last year, being unaware of their last sexual partners&#8217; HIV status and having had a recent HIV test (less than one year ago) remained independently and significantly associated with HIV-infection.\nDiscussion\nTo the best of our knowledge this the first study assessing HIV prevalence in a representative sample of sub-Saharan African migrants living in a European city. We found an HIV prevalence of 5.9% among women and 4.2% among men of sub-Saharan African origin socializing in Antwerp city. The HIV epidemic among the communities of sub-Saharan African migrants in Europe therefore resembles the magnitude of the HIV epidemics in their home countries. Regardless of the recently reported decreasing numbers of new HIV diagnoses in surveillance [1,14], our findings indicate that the HIV burden is high in this population and may even increase further. Sixty-five percent of sub-Saharan African migrants living with HIV were likely undiagnosed. This is higher than the general European estimation of one in three [26], and elevates the risk of onward HIV transmission [27]. HIV infection was independently associated with being 45 years or older (compared to 18 to 25 years), high condom use intentions, recent HIV testing, unawareness of last sexual partners&#8217; HIV status, no partner violence in the last year and sexual risk behavior when travelling within Europe in multivariable analysis. HIV positive sub-Saharan African migrants were 5.47 more likely to have had unprotected sex with a local partner when travelling in Europe compared to uninfected individuals. This demonstrates that African sexual networks are not limited to national borders and that HIV epidemics among sub-Saharan African migrant in different European countries are interlinked. Currently, HIV prevention strategies and policies differ between European countries [12,28], and for Belgium, even between regions. This local approach to HIV prevention does not match the needs of this mobile population, e.g. 56.9% of sub-Saharan African migrants in Antwerp travelled to another European country after settling in Belgium and 31.7% migrated within Europe before coming to Belgium. The lack of knowledge of local health services and rights constitutes a well-documented barrier for HIV prevention and testing uptake among sub-Saharan African migrants [12]. Consequently, an aligned European prevention approach is needed to effectively prevent HIV transmission among sub-Saharan African migrants across Europe.At community level, our data show that sub-Saharan African migrants socializing in Antwerp are at increased risk of acquiring HIV due their sexual culture and hardship. The preference for African sexual partners, the existence of African sexual networks [16], and a culture of concurrency elevate the risk of HIV-transmission [3, 10]. Among those in a stable relationship, 33.7% had a sexual partner &#8216;on the side&#8217; in the last year and 73.0% said their last sexual partner was of sub-Saharan African origin. In addition, many sub-Saharan African migrants in Antwerp are facing legal and financial problems: 21.1% were likely to be undocumented, 63.4% had financial problems in the last year and 8.8% lacked stable housing. The French ANRS PARCOURS study showed that this hardship increases the risk for HIV acquisition in France because it facilitates risky sexual relationships [29]. Our study partially corroborates this finding: we also found an association between being HIV-positive and unemployment (OR 2.59), but none between risky sexual behavior and HIV-status. The absence of an association between HIV-infection and risky sexual behavior is possibly due to the scale of our sample (i.e. 32 people living with HIV) and is therefore not generalizable. HIV-infection was independently associated to the absence of partner violence in the last year (AOR 0.09). This may be explained by relationship characteristics. A qualitative study among sub-Saharan African women living with HIV in Belgium showed that most women who disclosed their HIV status to their intimate partners received support and empathy from them [30]. Future research should focus on further identifying and describing the sub-groups within the sub-Saharan African migrant communities at increased risk of HIV acquisition in Europe in order to better tailor and target prevention interventions.Efforts should also be made to better tailor existing HIV testing and prevention efforts. Our findings show that currently diagnostic and preventive opportunities are missed. While reported HIV testing uptake was high among sub-Saharan African migrants in Antwerp city (i.e. 73.0% reported lifetime testing, 40.4% in the last year), potentially 65.2% of those found positive were undiagnosed. This indicates that current HIV testing efforts might not reach the sub-groups at highest risk. 3.5% (N = 28) of sub-Saharan African migrants reported a STI diagnosis in the last year and 3 of them among people with an undiagnosed HIV-infection. This means that often an STI diagnosis did not automatically lead to detecting HIV regardless of STI-testing guidelines which recommend combined HIV/STI-testing [31].Extensive efforts were made to ensure the study&#8217;s acceptance in the sub-Saharan African communities, participation and representativeness. We reached an acceptance rate of 60.2%, which is satisfactory considering the sensitivity of the research topic, the recruitment and data collection methods (eg. collection of oral fluid samples) and the general societal climate of pressuring migration laws. However, a selection bias cannot be excluded with regard to the study participants&#8217; age and study setting. To include the diverse sub-groups of sub-Saharan African migrants, the sampling frame was developed in a systematic manner and included settings that covered most aspects of sub-Saharan African migrants&#8217; social life in Antwerp. Yet, people who stay long term in facilities such as closed asylum centers, detention centers or hospitals were likely not reached. By including churches, shops and public settings likes streets, squares and parks we aimed at including people who are less often attending social venues. However, we cannot exclude underrepresentation of this sub-group and an effect on our HIV-prevalence estimates. Sub-Saharan African migrants living with HIV may isolate themselves due to fear for stigma, but do attend churches [30]. On the other hand, homebodies are less likely to meet new sexual partners and therefore may also be at reduced risk of acquiring HIV. This could have affected our results either way.Interpreting the results in terms of numbers of sub-Saharan African migrants who are unaware of their HIV status requires caution. Underreporting, both intentionally and unintentionally, cannot be excluded. Regardless of the GIPA approach and extensive anonymity measures taken in our study, some respondents might not have been willing to disclose their HIV status in the questionnaire. Avoidant HIV coping strategies might have resulted in denial or ignorance of their HIV status [32] among some HIV positive study participants. In spite of this potential bias, we still conclude that the proportion of sub-Saharan African migrants being unaware of their positive HIV status found in this study is unacceptably high.In conclusion, HIV prevalence among sub-Saharan African migrants in Antwerp city is high and the potential risk for future onwards HIV transmissions is elevated. An aligned European combination prevention approach [33] tailored to the needs of the sub-groups at highest risk (e.g. mobile and socially disadvantaged communities) is needed to prevent future HIV transmissions. Translating guidelines on integration of STI and HIV testing and counseling [31] into clinical practice and strengthened efforts to ensure HIV testing uptake among groups with a high risk for HIV acquisition should be prioritized. To be effective, they should be complemented with structural interventions at the policy level aiming at mitigating health related effects of economic hardship and ensuring access to health care and social rights [29].\nSupporting information\n", "pmid": "28380051", "title": "First HIV prevalence estimates of a representative sample of adult sub-Saharan African migrants in a European city.

Despite the lack of clear trends in our data, we encourage fire historians and ecosystem scientists to join forces and use even larger data sets to study C accumulation since fire in the complex Eurasian boreal landscapes.", "body": "Introduction\nForest fires rapidly release carbon (C) stored in organic material, and may contribute to climate change by increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). However, at a larger spatial and temporal scale, a pristine forest landscape can be assumed to be in a steady state, as forest patches recovering after fire sequester the same amount of C as is emitted during fires1. This balance is disturbed if fire severity or frequency is altered. These alterations could occur due to a changing climate or human-caused changes in ignitions or fire suppression. Fire frequency has been lengthening in the circumboreal forests during the past centuries2,3, and it appears unlikely that the rate of these changes would diminish in the upcoming decades. For example, current climate change driven by strengthening of the greenhouse effect is likely influencing fire regimes. If the decreasing trend is reversed, as is commonly believed to occur4, then ecosystem C density (C per unit land area) has less time to recover and mean C stocks are reducing in a given area.Boreal forest fires influence climate change, not only by affecting ecosystem C by altering mean stand age, as described above, but also by floristically altering the vegetation5 and therefore impacting C accumulation, albedo6,7, volatile organic compound emissions8 and insulating snow depth impacting permafrost and related emissions9. For example, Siberian boreal forests are often divided into dark taiga, dominated by Picea and Abies, and light taiga, where Larix is the most important tree genus10. Frequent surface fires are believed to favour the development of light taiga with its fire-tolerant Larix and Pinus sylvestris trees. Mature individuals of these species have thick insulating bark in the lower parts of their trunks11. Several successive fires could therefore tip areas currently dominated by dark taiga into light taiga or to deciduous forest of trees, whose below-ground parts can survive fires and sprout rapidly (angiosperms). Reversely, the absence of fires could favour the shade-tolerant but fire-intolerant species (Picea and Pinus sibirica). These floristic shifts could influence the climate, not only by altering mean C stocks, but also via albedo, emissions of volatile organic compound and emissions triggered by melting permafrost.Another mechanism for how fires influence climate change is through their impacts on nitrogen (N). Fires decrease N in ecosystems through oxidation and volatilization of N stored in biomass and surface soil12&#8211;14, which may have implications on primary production and C sequestration in N-limited boreal forests. Furthermore, fire-induced changes in soil abiotic environments (temperature, moisture, pH), microbial biomass and community composition, organic matter quality and vegetation alter N pools and fluxes during post-fire succession15,16.Increased understanding of how fires influence the Siberian taiga and global climate is pivotal. Because of the large area and little direct human impact via logging or land conversion, even a small fire regime shift causing changes in these forests could drastically alter the global climate17 and influence the overall biosphere&#8217;s impact on global C balance18.Vegetation succession and the post-fire accumulation of C and N can be studied experimentally19, but this methodology is not suitable for studying the recovery of boreal tree biomass, as the process takes centuries. Instead, the chronosequence approach has been the standard methodology, which assumes that the time since the last disturbance is the only difference between the studied plots20.For example, in a chronosequence of plots with up to 151 years since a stand-replacing fire, Picea mariana &#8211;dominated &#8220;wet&#8221; sites accumulated some 86&#8201;g&#8201;m&#8722;2 of ecosystem C annually, while dryer sites in Northern Manitoba, central Canada accumulated approximately half of that21. In a similar climate in central Alaska and the same dominant tree species, Mack et al.22 estimated significantly lower biomass accumulation rates of roughly 20&#8201;g&#8201;m&#8722;2 of C annually in a mesic site and less in a dry site, using similar methodology. In a Pinus sylvestris -dominated landscape in central Siberia, C in the above-ground biomass accumulated in the more fertile sites at a rate of 100&#8201;g&#8201;m&#8722;2 annually for 250 years, but at only 15% of this rate in the less fertile forest type23.These chronosequence-based studies have provided precious information on C accumulation since fire occurrence. However, Johnson and Miyanishi24 raised their concern and claimed that the assumption that only time since disturbance causes the differences in vegetation is typically assumed without testing, and all four classic chronosequence studies that they examined exhibited other factors apart from time since disturbance that significantly influenced the vegetation. For example, Palviainen et al.16 showed that increasing anthropogenic N deposition was a major driver of the N balance in the northern boreal pine chronosequence. Perhaps more dangerously, limiting data analysis to the chronosequence approach, restricts ecologists to study edaphically and climatically uniform areas, which form only a small minority of e.g. most boreal regions. Furthermore, even in the uniform areas only those patterns matching the a priori perceptions of the researchers end up in chronosequence studies, as another pattern would incorrectly be perceived by these researchers as violating the uniformity criterion. A risk of circular reasoning therefore exists, and chronosequence studies are likely to reinforce the prior views of the researchers, but are unlikely to give unexpected results. E.g. when floristic succession is studied, changes that are in conflict with the prior understanding might be wrongly perceived as caused e.g. by soil variables that are difficult to study and the researcher might move to an area matching the classic thinking. These problems with the chronosequence approach are especially significant in Eurasian boreal forests, which typically have non-stand-replacing fires25. Using a single variable to describe the impact of past fires in such circumstances can be misleading.Our objective was to quantify C and N accumulation and changes in tree species composition and stand density since fire occurrence in central Siberia based on an inventory-style sampling in which we chose plot locations prior to visiting the area. This approach is immune to the problems of the chronosequence approach described above, but is challenging for other reasons. The acceptance of plots varying edaphically or climatically or where the severity of previous fires has varied causes variation in the results, and only a large data set is likely to reveal clear trends. Secondly, fire history is challenging to study in a complex area compared to a simple &#8220;one species and time since stand-replacing fire -landscape&#8221;, and could potentially be influenced by edaphic or climatic conditions that could confuse the interpretation of the results.To better take the variability of fire severity into consideration, we related vegetation succession and C and N accumulation not only to the time since previous fire occurrence, but also to forest age, which can be considered a proxy for the time since the previous stand-replacing fire, but could also be determined by another stand-replacing disturbance or the maximum age of the tree species. We hypothesized that:C and N in living trees increase with increasing forest age and time since fire because trees are killed in fires.C and N in the understorey and moss layer and humus layer increase with increasing forest age and time since fire occurrence because they burn partly.C and N in snags and fallen logs decrease with increasing forest age and time since fire occurrence because trees are killed by the fire, but increase when more time has passed because of increasing tree mortality26.The decrease of C and N in snags and fallen logs during the first decades is less significant than the increase in other pools and therefore overall ecosystem C and N increase with forest age and time since fire occurrence.The biomass proportion of sprouting fire-intolerant tree species decreases with increasing forest age, as they are able to grow rapidly after stand-replacing disturbance27.The biomass proportion of non-sprouting fire-intolerant tree species increases with increasing forest age and time since fire, as their mortality is high in fires and they need a long time to recover27.The biomass proportion of non-sprouting fire-tolerant tree species decreases with increasing time since fire, as their mortality in fires is lower than that of the other groups10.Stand density (number of tree individuals per unit area) decreases with increasing forest age and time since fire after the first decades27, as self-thinning is likely to outweigh the opposite impact of more time granted for reproduction and regrowth.\nHypotheses 1, 2 and 4 were directly based on fire chemistry while we defined the rest of them based on studies conducted elsewhere.\nResults\nWe measured a total of 943 living trees, 146 snags and 313 fallen logs. The living trees belonged to nine tree species (genus Salix is counted as one species). Only Larix occurred on all 46 plots, and the majority of species occurred on fewer than 10 plots (Table&#160;1). The thickest Larix and Pinus sylvestris individuals had a dbh of over 50&#8201;cm, but only Larix surpassed 30&#8201;m in height. Larix contributed 72.5% of the total living tree biomass, followed by Pinus sylvestris, Betula and Picea. The remaining five species each contributed less than 1%. The basal area averaged 17.9&#8201;m2 and ranged from 1.1&#8201;m2 to 46.9&#8201;m2 on the plots. The above-ground biomass averaged 8.5&#8201;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2 and its C content averaged 4.3&#8201;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2 (from 0.2&#8201;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2 to 14.6&#8201;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2). The C content of snags averaged 0.9&#8201;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2 (from 0.0&#8201;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2 to 4.3&#8201;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2), while that of fallen logs averaged 1.9&#8201;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2 (from 0.0&#8201;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2 to 6.9&#8201;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2), that of the understorey and moss layer averaged 1.2&#8201;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2 (from 0.3&#8201;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2 to 5.0&#8201;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2) and finally that of the humus layer averaged 1.7&#8201;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2 (from 0.3&#8201;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2 to 13.9&#8201;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2). The humus layer thickness ranged from 0&#8201;cm to 27&#8201;cm with an average of 4.4&#8201;cm, and the moss layer from 0 to 26&#8201;cm with an average of 5.3&#8201;cm.Table 1Information on the nine species, with heights of at least 1.9&#8201;m, found on the plots.

When 0.05 was used as the P-value, increasing C content in living trees with increasing time since fire was the only statistically significant trend (Fig.&#160;1). When the P-value limit is relaxed to 0.1, four other rising trends became statistically significant.Figure 1C density relative to forest age and time since previous fire occurrence. The top two panels show only plots sampled during same hikes with same symbols.\nThe mineral soils under the humus layer were mainly clays and silts. The moss layer was dominated chiefly by Pleurozium, Cladonia, Hylocomium, Dicranum and Sphagnum. Vaccinium was by far the most dominant genera in the grass and draft shrub layer, accompanied by Carex, Rhododendron, Linnaea, Salix, Epilobium and the family Poaceae. The shrub layer consisted mainly of small trees, but individuals belonging to genera Rosa and Juniperus were additionally present. We tried to understand the causes of the scatter in Fig.&#160;1 by taking into account the texture of mineral soil or coverage of understory vegetation based forest types or fertility classes but these additional variables did not help in interpreting the data.The N pool in living trees increased significantly since fire, while that of fallen logs increased with forest age (Fig.&#160;2). A large proportion of N was stored in the humus layer. In areas where the time since fire was &#8804;52 years, the organic layer N pools accounted for 35% of the total ecosystem N and in the plots with longest time since fire (218 years), this proportion was as high as 51%.Figure 2N density relative to forest age and time since previous fire occurrence.\nOur plots on floristic tree succession showed even less trends (Fig.&#160;3). Sprouting fire-intolerants, i.e. the angiosperms, had a small biomass share that never exceeded 50%, but this was not influenced by forest age or time since fire occurrence. The pattern is very similar for non-sprouting fire-intolerants, Picea and Pinus sibirica, and therefore naturally also the proportion of the remaining group of non-sprouting fire-tolerants Larix and Pinus sylvestris did not reveal trends.Figure 3Biomass proportion of tree functional groups relative to forest age and time since previous fire occurrence.\nStand density was not influenced by forest age (Fig.&#160;4). However, the decreasing trend of lower stand density with increasing time since fire was statistically more significant than any of the trends related to the main focus of this paper.Figure 4Number of trees of at least 1.9&#8201;m in height per unit area relative to forest age and time since previous fire occurrence.\nIn addition to explaining C, N, floristic composition of trees and stand density with forest age and time since fire, we conducted some modelling considering all dated fires for each plot on C in living trees. However, even this failed to explain the large scatter (Supplementary Info File).\nDiscussion\nWe understood prior to the fieldwork that our inventory approach, which is more objective compared to the standard chronosequence method, requires sufficient numbers of plots to reveal any trends. However, we were surprised that our study area was so heterogeneous that even with our 46 plots we were unable to expose many statistically significant trends. Our hypotheses 1, 2 and especially 4 were directly derived from the fact that burning releases C and N that have to be recovered back into the ecosystem. However, we found only weak support for these hypotheses (Figs&#160;1 and 2). In the case of dead wood (hypothesis 3) we expected the legacy of dead wood produced by the fire to first dominate, and the trends for snags and fallen logs to initially decrease for the first decades and then be reversed. As each of our plots had not experienced a fire in at least 44 years, a rising trend should have been visible, but this was not the case.Our weak trends hint of annual C accumulation of approximately 15&#8201;g&#8201;m&#8722;2 for living trees and 17&#8201;g&#8201;m&#8722;2 for all ecosystem C above the mineral soil since fire occurrence. These number are small compared to the up to 100&#8201;g&#8201;m&#8722;2 of C that accumulates annually in a similar but somewhat warmer climate in Canada21. However, because of severe stand-replacing fires in North America the situation is completely different from our area, which is dominated by less severe surface fires that do not release so much resources for the new tree cohort and therefore the stand reaches its self-thinning or &#8220;stagnative equilibrium&#8221;28 stage more rapidly. It is also possible that many chronosequence studies have been conducted in areas with clearer and more rapid succession than on average, therefore biasing the overall picture. Furthermore, our data set did not include plots with less than 44 years since fire occurrence. It is likely that these first decades have faster C accumulation thanks to warming of the soil and withdrawal of the permafrost, resulting in increased nutrient availability29.In addition to time since fire, we plotted C densities also relative to forest age, i.e. the age of the oldest looking tree on each the plot. We did this to gain an idea of C and N accumulation based on two thresholds in the fire severity gradient ranging from fires undetectable with fire history methods30 to stand-replacing fires. Again, the weak trends cause vague discussions on the differences between C accumulation with increasing forest age and time since fire occurrence, but the accumulation of all ecosystem C is surprisingly similar (bottom left and right in Fig.&#160;1). With a larger data set it is likely that the higher starting C density at the beginning of succession when all detectable fires were included (bottom right in Fig.&#160;1) would become evident.Post-fire annual N accumulation rate was 0.07&#8201;g&#8201;m&#8722;2 for living trees (Fig.&#160;2). The weak trend (P&#8201;=&#8201;0.25) for N accumulation above the mineral soil was 0.19&#8201;g&#8201;m&#8722;2. Boreal forests have been reported to annually accumulate 0.29&#8211;0.33&#8201;g&#8201;N m&#8722;2\n31,32. Our post-fire N accumulation rate was lower than this range, but quite the same order of magnitude as the values (0.21&#8211;0.23 g N m&#8722;2 yr&#8722;1) reported for sub-arctic Pinus sylvestris forests after non-stand-replacing fires16. Previous studies have reported either decreases or no change in soil N pools after forest fires1,12,13,15,16. We found that unlike for C, a large proportion of ecosystem N pools were stored in the humus layer (Fig.&#160;2).We expected clear trends related to groups of tree species defined based on fire tolerance and sprouting ability. We expected these not only because of mechanisms described in the list of hypotheses (5, 6 and 7), but also due to positive feedbacks. E.g. fire-intolerant Picea not only benefits from the absence of fires, but it also shades and keeps the understorey more humid than under light-demanding species and therefore lowers the likelihood of fire. Larix and Pinus sylvestris contrastingly benefit from fires killing other species and reducing competition and at the same time allowing light to dry the mosses, lichens and litter and increasing the likelihood of fire. Such positive feedbacks could cause relatively sudden changes, where one forest type shifts to another as a result of climate or fire regime changes. These change are unlikely to be reversed even if climate- or fire-related drivers revert to their previous state. Similarly, these positive feedbacks could cause spatially sudden jumps from dark taiga to light taiga, as is the case in central Siberia10. Surprisingly, our data did not reveal any trends related to tree species biomass proportions when plotted against forest age or time since fire occurrence (Fig.&#160;3). This could be because the disturbance return interval was so short that early successional species were still abundant in all the plots, or perhaps the legacy of fire history over five hundred years could still be determining the current species distribution. It is also possible that our data set was just too small to show the supposed dark taiga succession of late successional Picea replacing Betula with increasing time since disturbance27.Despite our trends in C accumulation being weak, they can be used with caution to speculate on the C implications of changing fire regimes due to direct human impacts on ignitions or fire spread via firefighting. First assume that the intercept, 8.50&#8201;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2 of the regression in bottom right of Fig.&#160;1, is the density of ecosystem C (above the mineral soil) immediately after a fire and that C increases at an annual rate of 17.4&#8201;g&#8201;m&#8722;2. Then the lengthening of the fire cycle from 52 years in the 18th century to 164 years in the 20th century3 would translate into an increase of 0.97&#8201;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2 assuming that nothing else changes and in an increase in C emission per fire from 905&#8201;g&#8201;m&#8722;2 to 2,854&#8201;g&#8201;m&#8722;2, which are low compared to fuel consumption levels gained mainly from experimental burnings reviewed by Kukavskaya et al.33. When C implications of the longer fire cycle in the study area are extrapolated to the entire Russian forest area34, such a change would translate in an increase of 7.9 Pg of C in two centuries, which is close to the recent annual global anthropogenic emissions35. When divided over two centuries, the annual sequestration of 0.04 Pg of C is very small compared to the increased biomass based on remote sensing36. However, our estimate is likely to be conservative, as the independence assumption of the departure point of C accumulation likely causes an underestimation in the C implications of an altered fire regime. In reality, C density prior to the fire probably positively influences the density after fire, i.e. repeated frequent fires could pull the post-fire ecosystem C density downwards fire after fire. The changes in tree species composition triggered by changes in fire regime, as discussed in the two previous paragraphs, could also have significant impacts in either direction.Similarly, C impacts of the predicted shortening fire cycle due to climate change37 can be estimated, despite these speculations being even less certain. Firstly, because climate and fire danger simulations are uncertain &#8211; even knowing whether fires are increasing or decreasing, assuming no change in fire suppression, is an open question. Secondly, because of a warming climate, CO2 fertilization and N deposition are directly speeding up C accumulation in central Siberia38.With our methodology we were able to avoid certain problems related to the chronosequence approach, but we faced some new methodological challenges. We did not concentrate our sampling on a uniform homogenous area, but still had to exclude some land ecosystem types, i.e. peatlands. If the thickness of the humus layer increases with time since fire occurrence39, and this depth is used to define a peatland, then inevitably if fire is absent for long enough a site is classified as peatland and is excluded from the sampling, which could truncate our data set and even cause bias. However, it is unlikely that this causes significant problems in our study despite two plots included in the sampling were clearly paludified and had thicker humus layers with much higher C and especially N density than all the others (outliers in the humus layer in Figs&#160;1 and 2). Another complication is caused by our underlying assumption that edaphic or climatic heterogeneity do not influence the fire regime within our area, which certainly is far from the truth in intensively human influenced boreal Europe during the 18th and 19th centuries40. Fortunately, the large size of fires3 relative to the spatial pattern of edaphic heterogeneity in our study area mitigates the danger of bias caused e.g. by more common fires in dryer and more productive soils, which would lead to an underestimation of C recovery.The research communities focusing on soil C and fire history have traditionally been distinct in boreal Eurasia and only a few soil C studies even mention forest fires despite most of Eurasian boreal forests having burned in the past centuries41 and the humus layer is likely still recovering rapidly from the previous fire, as this can take millennia42. Because of the separation of these two research communities, past fires are not typically discussed when past43 or future44 soil C has been modelled. We hope that our paper coupling a meticulously implemented fire history study3 with ecosystem C sampling, encourages more similar studies. Hopefully these will incorporate even more plots in Eurasian boreal forests and elsewhere, which would lead to a better understanding of past and future ecosystem C as fire regimes have changed and will continue to change.\nMethods\nWe wished to accomplish the research objectives by studying a remote and sparsely populated part of the Siberian taiga, which nevertheless represents a vast area of the little-studied region. We chose &#8220;middle taiga&#8221;45\nLarix-dominated forests along Nizhnyaya Tunguska, a tributary of the Yenisei River, in northern Irkutsk Oblast close to the town of Yerbogachen, where inhabitants are concentrated in villages along the river (Fig.&#160;5). The river is also the principal mean of transport in the area. However, with the exception of spring floods, the rapids of the river make it impossible for larger boats to travel on it.Figure 5Map showing the location of the study area in eastern Russia (left) and the 46 plots on both sides of the river Nizhnyaya Tunguska (right). The map was modified from3.\nThe area has an ultra-continental climate. Yerbogachen has a mean temperature of 16.6&#8201;&#176;C in July, &#8722;31.8&#8201;&#176;C in January and annual precipitation of 401 mm, 69% of which falls during the wetter six-month-period from May to October46. The area has discontinuous permafrost47.We carried out the fieldwork in August and September 2003 by completing four six-day hikes as far inland as possible to minimize the impact of the river (Fig.&#160;5). The vicinity of the river is likely to be more influenced by humans and the fire regime could be impacted by the river acting as a natural fire break or because of the spring floods, unusual soils and vegetation in the vicinity of the river. The elevation of our plots ranged from 280&#8201;m to 440&#8201;m above sea level with higher elevations in the South reducing the climatic variability within our study area. The local topography was dominated by gentle slopes rarely more than 50&#8201;m high. We overoptimistically aimed to inventory a higher number of plots during the first and southernmost of the hikes, but had to settle for fourteen plots. During the remaining three hikes we compromised and completed twelve plots during each hike, resulting in a total of fifty plots. However, we did not collect data from plots on peatland, defined as having a humus layer of 30&#8201;cm or more. We encountered one peatland plot during each hike, and therefore collected data from 46 plots. We used a rough map to choose the locations of all the hikes and the plots prior to the field trip. The map contained very little information other than the main river and we positioned the hikes on outer sides on a twist of the meandering river to avoid having plots surrounded by the river from three sides. The hikes were some thirty kilometers apart along the river, and the plots were located two kilometers from the neighbouring plot or plots. We encountered signs of human activity, such as isolated cabins for sable hunters, during three out of the four hikes, but none were close to the plots and we saw no signs of significant logging anywhere. Photos from the plots from the southernmost and northernmost hikes are available in the Supplementary Info File.The sampling was designed to serve both a published fire history study3 and this paper, which is partly based on results from the study. In summary, the fire history reconstruction was based on samples taken from trees with fire scars and from the oldest-looking trees on the plots with a 100&#8201;m radius. The scars analysed with dendrochronological techniques revealed the year of the latest fire and the age of the oldest-looking tree revealed the forest age. GPS coordinates of the plot centres were predefined before starting the hikes. To prevent underrepresentation of the densest thickets that are naturally avoided while walking and searching for the set GPS point, we centred the plots 10&#8201;m from the GPS point.We measured living trees that were at least 1.9&#8201;m tall. Trees with a dbh (diameter at 1.3&#8201;m height) of at least 20&#8201;cm (rounded to the closest cm) were included from a plot with a radius of 10&#8201;m, thinner trees but with a dbh of at least 10&#8201;cm were included from a plot with a radius of 5&#8201;m and even thinner trees from a plot with a radius of 2.5&#8201;m. In addition to measuring dbh with a calliper, we measured height with a Vertex (Hagl&#246;f Sweden AB, L&#229;ngsele, Sweden) that is based on the tangent method48. We estimated the height of the shortest trees based on their height relative to the known height of the fieldworkers.We measured snags (dead standing trees) as living trees with one exception. When a snag had a broken top we recorded a rough visual estimate of the top diameter of the remaining snag.Fallen logs, or pieces of coarse wood debris, were included in the sampling when their thicker end was at least 10&#8201;cm in width and located less than 10&#8201;m from the plot centre. We measured the length of each fallen log and the diameter at both ends. When the shape differed from that of a cut cone, we recorded the diameters that we visually estimated, to calculate the true volume of the fallen log when volume is computed assuming the shape of a cut cone. We additionally performed a simplified version of the &#8220;knife test&#8221;, in which we pressed a knife vigorously into the wood, and recorded its penetration level49. We used the following classes: 1) blade does not penetrate significantly, 2) blade penetrates, but not all the way and 3) blade penetrates fully.Due to the challenging logistics, we could not transport heavy soil samples to a laboratory. We measured the thickness of both humus and moss layers at seven locations along the twenty-meter axis running through the plot. In addtion we conducted light destructive soil sampling. From each plot, with the help of a 7&#8201;cm square plastic plate, we cut samples with a knife from two opposite points 4&#8201;m from the plot centre. We collected the understorey vegetation and moss layer into one plastic bag and the humus or organic layer down to the mineral soil into another bag. The understorey vegetation and moss layer included all living woody plants less than 1.9&#8201;m in height, non-woody plants and litter, including fine woody debris and branches of fallen logs. The humus layer included all materials, including living roots, below the lower parts of the living mosses and lichens and above the mineral soil, in which more than half of the volume is composed of mineral particles. We dried, weather permitting, these bagged samples in the field to avoid decomposition during the transportation lasting over two months at maximum.In addition we classified the mineral soils under the humus layer based on hand identification. We also identified the floristic composition of dominant plant genera at three layers.We transported both the fire history, and samples from the understorey and moss layer and the humus layer to the University of Helsinki, Finland. In the laboratory, soil samples were dried (60&#8201;&#176;C, 24&#8201;h), sieved through a 2 mm sieve, and ground. The C and N concentrations of the samples were determined with a CN-analyzer (Leco CSN-1000, Leco Corp., St Joseph, MI, USA) and subsamples were taken for dry mass determination (105&#8201;&#176;C, 24&#8201;h). All data is available in Supplementary Dataset File.We estimated the C content of living trees based on our measured heights and dbh&#8217;s and the allometric equations by assuming that 50% of the living biomass was C, which is likely an accurate value for our region50. Nitrogen concentrations of living trees were obtained from the literature51&#8211;55. Because of the importance of Larix in our plots, we developed new allometric equations for it based on the destructive sampling of 112 Larix trees close to the Tura research station some 500&#8201;km from our main study area (Supplementary Info File). For the second most important species, Pinus sylvestris, we used published equations from approximately 1,000&#8201;km west of our study area23. Some of their equations were age-based. We used the equations for 95-year-old trees for our trees with a dbh of 0.1&#8201;m or less, and the equations parameterized for age classes of 138, 200, 204 and 215 years for trees thicker than that. Central Siberian allometric equations were not available for the remaining tree species. We computed the biomass of Pinus sibirica trees with the same equations as for Pinus sylvestris trees, but multiplied with the wood density ratio, 340&#8201;kg&#8201;m&#8722;3/380&#8201;kg&#8201;m&#8722;3, given by Harmon et al.56. For the remaining species we unfortunately had to use equations parameterized for North European trees, but based on our visual field comparisons large biases were unlikely. We estimated Picea\n57 and Betula\n58 biomasses directly, but performed similar wood density -based calibration as for Pinus sibirica for the remaining rare angiosperm species or genus Salix (which is listed in Table&#160;1 as the ninth &#8220;species&#8221; for simplicity). We used the Betula equation modified by the ratio of mean wood density in a wood density database and Betula wood density from Finland (475&#8201;kg&#8201;m&#8722;3)59 as for Pinus sibirica. We used a wood density of 350&#8201;kg&#8201;m&#8722;3 for Populus\n56, while the densities for Alnus (417&#8201;kg&#8201;m&#8722;3)\n, Salix (408&#8201;kg&#8201;m&#8722;3) and Sorbus (573&#8201;kg&#8201;m&#8722;3) were based on the means of all the Asian records in the database60.As probably even a larger share of snags than living trees are Larix due to their durable wood, we computed snag necromasses using the same equations as for living Larix trees. However, we assumed a decrease in wood density and change in the proportion of C due to decomposition. We used reported values61 for Pinus sylvestris, the second most important species in our plots because of the similarity between it and Larix wood, and their knife test class 1, i.e. a decrease of 9.1% in C. For snags with tops missing we assumed constant tapering based on the top and 1.3&#8201;m height diameters, a shape of a cut cone and wood density of 460&#8201;kg&#8201;m&#8722;3\n56, but with the same decrease of 9.1% in C.As with snags, we assumed all fallen logs to be Larix wood, and computed their volume assuming a shape of cut cones. To take into account the decrease of C due to decomposition, we used the data reported for Pinus sylvestris by combining the knife test classes 1 and 2 of M&#228;kinen et al.61 to correspond to our most intact class, their class 3 to correspond to our intermediate class and their classes 4 and 5 to correspond to our most decayed class. The assumed decreases in C were 21.2%, 45.4% and 77.1%, respectively, and are mainly caused by a decrease in wood density with only minuscule impact from changing proportion of C61. Based on previous studies, N concentrations were assumed to be 0.21%, 0.27% and 0.41% in decay classes 1, 2 and 3, respectively62,63.\nElectronic supplementary material\n\nNone\n\nSupplementary Info File\nSupplementary dataset file\n", "pmid": "28986589", "title": "Post-fire carbon and nitrogen accumulation and succession in Central Siberia", "journal_title": "Scientific Reports", "authors": "Markku Larjavaara;Frank Berninger;Marjo Palviainen;Anatoly Prokushkin;Tuomo Wallenius", "doi": "10.1038/s41598-017-13039-2", "score": "0.008085373"}, {"keywords": "Alzheimer\u2019s disease;BACE1;BACE inhibitors;Synapse;Sez6", "abstract": "Inhibition of the protease &#946;-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is a promising treatment strategy for Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, and a number of BACE inhibitors are currently progressing through clinical trials. The strategy aims to decrease production of amyloid-&#946; (A&#946;) peptide from the amyloid precursor protein (APP), thus reducing or preventing A&#946; toxicity. Over the last decade, it has become clear that BACE1 proteolytically cleaves a number of substrates in addition to APP. These substrates are not known to be involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease but have other roles in the developing and/or mature central nervous system. Consequently, BACE inhibition and knockout in mice results in synaptic and other neuronal dysfunctions and the key substrates responsible for these deficits are still being elucidated. Of the BACE1 substrates that have been validated to date, a number may contribute to the synaptic deficits seen with BACE blockade, including neuregulin 1, close homologue of L1 and seizure-related gene 6. It is important to understand the impact that BACE blockade may have on these substrates and other proteins detected in substrate screens and, if necessary, develop substrate-selective BACE inhibitors.", "body": "BACE1 Is a Therapeutic Target in Alzheimer\u2019s Disease\nAlzheimer&#8217;s disease is the most common type of dementia and is characterised pathologically by amyloid-&#946; (A&#946;) plaque deposition and neurofibrillary tangles. Increased levels of A&#946; peptide produced by proteolytic cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) are associated with the formation of neurotoxic amyloid aggregates and early synapse loss and neuronal dysfunction (Shankar et al. 2008; Selkoe and Hardy 2016). The A&#946; peptide is produced by consecutive cleavage of APP by &#946;- and &#947;-secretases (Lichtenthaler et al. 2011). Additional APP cleavage products, some of which are neurotoxic, are generated by &#945;-, &#948;- and &#951;-secretases (Lammich et al. 1999; Kuhn et al. 2010; Willem et al. 2015; Zhang et al. 2015). The &#946;-secretase responsible for the proteolytic processing of APP in the brain is &#946;-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) (Vassar et al. 1999). Processing of APP by BACE1 is the rate-limiting step in the production of A&#946;, and therefore, BACE1 is a major therapeutic target for the treatment of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease.BACE1 activity increases in the ageing cortex (Fukumoto et al. 2004), and elevated BACE1 levels can be found in the brains of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease patients (Fukumoto et al. 2002; Zhao et al. 2007; H&#233;bert et al. 2008). APP mutations in the human population which increase or decrease APP processing by BACE1 can promote or protect against the development of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, respectively (Mullan et al. 1992; Jonsson et al. 2012). Knockout of BACE1 prevents A&#946; production and improves memory in mouse models of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (Cai et al. 2001; Luo et al. 2001; Ohno et al. 2004; Ohno et al. 2006; Ohno et al. 2007). Similarly, the administration of competitive inhibitors of BACE1 improves outcomes in animal models of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease and provides the rationale for extending this treatment to patients (Vassar et al. 2014). A number of BACE inhibitors are progressing through clinical trials, the most advanced being MK-8931 from Merck which is currently in phase III trials (Evin et al. 2015; Bar&#227;o et al. 2016; Mullard 2016). Results from these and subsequent clinical trials will demonstrate how safe and effective BACE inhibitors are for the treatment of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, and may answer questions regarding the optimal level of BACE inhibition and the utility of this approach for treating patients at different stages of disease (e.g. prodromal vs. asymptomatic patients).However, over the last decade, it has become clear that BACE1 not only cleaves APP but also has a number of other proteolytic substrates which are not known to be involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease but rather have other roles in the central nervous system. Concerns have been raised that mechanism-based side effects of BACE inhibitors may limit their use as therapeutics (Vassar et al. 2014; Evin et al. 2015; Bar&#227;o et al. 2016). Indeed, recent animal studies have shown that BACE inhibition results in synaptic and cognitive deficits (Filser et al. 2015; Willem et al. 2015) and the production of a newly identified APP peptide, A&#951;-&#945;, which causes neuronal dysfunction (Willem et al. 2015). Here, we will summarise the synaptic deficits known to result from BACE1 knockout and blockade in mice, and describe key BACE1 substrates that may contribute to this outcome.\nEffects of BACE1 Knockout and BACE1 Inhibition on Synaptic and Neuronal Function\nBACE inhibitors are suggested to be most effective when treatment begins very early in the disease pathogenesis (Yan and Vassar 2014), and it is therefore important to know what effect chronic BACE inhibition may have on the brain in the absence of excess levels of A&#946; peptide. Constitutive BACE1 knockout (KO) mice provide valuable information about how BACE1 substrates are affected when their proteolytic cleavage is altered. BACE1 KO mice were originally thought to have no significant phenotypes (Luo et al. 2001), but a number of subtle and more severe physiological and behavioural deficits have since been discovered. These include hypomyelination (Hu et al. 2006; Willem et al. 2006), axon guidance errors in the olfactory bulb (Rajapaksha et al. 2011; Cao et al. 2012) and hippocampus (Hitt et al. 2012), seizures (Kobayashi et al. 2008; Hitt et al. 2010), altered astrogenesis and neurogenesis (Hu et al. 2013), increased likelihood of postnatal death and small size (Dominguez et al. 2005), altered insulin sensitivity (Meakin et al. 2012), decreased anxiety (Laird et al. 2005), schizophrenia endophenotypes (Savonenko et al. 2008) and motor deficits (Kobayashi et al. 2008; Cheret et al. 2013). Notably, BACE1 KO mice also exhibit alterations in synaptic number and function. Reduced spine density, including a decreased proportion of mushroom spines, is seen in CA1 pyramidal neurons of the BACE1 KO hippocampus (Savonenko et al. 2008). BACE1 KO mice display altered synaptic plasticity in CA1 and CA3 regions (Laird et al. 2005; Wang et al. 2008; Wang et al. 2014) which is reflected in deficits in hippocampal-dependent spatial reference and working memory (Laird et al. 2005; Kobayashi et al. 2008).BACE1 KO mice have a complete loss of BACE1, and while the optimum level of inhibition in patients remains to be determined, complete inhibition of BACE1 proteolytic activity is not the aim. Additionally, BACE1 expression is very high during the first postnatal week in mice (Willem et al. 2006) and some phenotypes of BACE1 KO mice are due to altered processing of substrates during development. Therefore, they may be of limited relevance to BACE1 inhibition in the adult brain, even though some neurodevelopmental processes continue in the adult central nervous system or may be reactivated in the diseased brain. Alternatively, it is possible that the lack of BACE1 during development leads to compensatory changes in constitutive BACE1 KOs, and inhibiting BACE1 in the adult brain may have more pronounced effects on particular substrates than predicted from BACE1 KO mice. Fortunately, serious side effects have not been observed in patients in current clinical trials but mechanism-based side effects could potentially counteract the benefits of BACE inhibition.Recent animal studies indicate that BACE blockade in adulthood can have a negative effect on neuronal function. Firstly, BACE inhibition is associated with a reduction in muscle spindles in adult mice (covered in more detail under the section &#8216;Neuregulin 1&#8217;) (Cheret et al. 2013). Secondly, a study by Willem et al. (2015) demonstrates that BACE inhibitors promote the accumulation of an APP product, A&#951;-&#945;, which has a detrimental effect on neuronal function. The newly discovered &#951;-secretase was found to cleave the APP protein; this C-terminal fragment (CTF)-&#951; is further processed by BACE1 or &#945;-secretase to produce A&#951;-&#945; or A&#951;-&#946; peptides, respectively. Inhibiting BACE in mice leads to increased levels of the A&#951;-&#945; peptide which is detrimental to neuronal function, altering long-term potentiation (LTP) and reducing neuronal activity (Willem et al. 2015). Therefore, BACE inhibition may simultaneously decrease one neurotoxic APP product (A&#946;) while increasing another (A&#951;-&#945;). Future studies need to clarify whether the increase in A&#951;-&#945; seen in mice is also observed in humans. Additionally, it will be essential to understand whether and how A&#951;-&#945; contributes to Alzheimer&#8217;s disease. It is currently unclear how the balance of these two APP peptides will ultimately affect the pathological and cognitive changes in Alzheimer&#8217;s disease patients. In another recent study, Filser et al. (2015) chronically treated wild-type mice with a BACE inhibitor and identified altered synaptic morphology and function and behavioural deficits. Decreased spine formation on dendrites of cortical pyramidal neurons was observed, which was reversible upon the cessation of treatment. BACE inhibition was shown to decrease neuronal activity and suppress LTP, resulting in memory deficits as assessed by novel object recognition and Y maze spontaneous alternation (Filser et al. 2015). The identification of altered synaptic function and plasticity in the normal adult mouse brain with BACE blockade is significant, as BACE inhibitors may work best if patients are chronically treated from the early stage of the disease. The synaptic and behavioural changes identified by Filser et al. were not attributed to specific BACE1 substrates. There are a number of validated and yet to be validated BACE1 substrates that have known roles in synaptic function and may contribute to the observed results.Therefore, it is possible that the BACE inhibitors currently being trialled will have some detrimental effects on neuronal function. Inhibition of &#947;-secretase was previously a viable therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, but phase III trials were terminated because of adverse side effects which may have been due to altered processing of the Notch receptor, a &#947;-secretase substrate (De Strooper 2014). Like BACE1, &#947;-secretase cleaves a number of substrates in addition to APP. While the BACE inhibition strategy is unlikely to have such severe side effects, there are likely to be mechanism-based side effects associated with the use of BACE inhibitors. Important questions remain: what will the short- and long-term consequences of chronic BACE inhibition be in human patients? Would the effects of BACE blockade on synapses still be reversible in humans if treatment were to be continued for an extended period of time? What is the ideal BACE inhibition strategy which decreases A&#946; production while having a minimal impact on other BACE1 substrates? It is important, firstly, to identify the main BACE1 substrates associated with the negative effects on synaptic function and consider whether the BACE inhibitor strategy could be adapted to allow sparing of key substrates, if it should prove necessary.\nBACE1 Substrates Associated with Synaptic Function\nDozens of potential proteolytic substrates of BACE1 have been identified over the last decade, many of which have been identified through proteomic studies (Hemming et al. 2009; Kuhn et al. 2012; Zhou et al. 2012; Hogl et al. 2013; Dislich et al. 2015), and some substrates have been validated in vitro or in vivo by analysing cleaved substrate products in the vertebrate brain or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Of these validated substrates, several have known roles in synaptic function and these substrates are discussed below.\nNeuregulin 1\nNeuregulin 1 (NRG1) is a member of the neuregulin family of epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like proteins which are ligands for ErbB tyrosine kinase receptors. NRG1 has multiple isoforms that arise from alternative splicing, and these are categorised into six types based on structure (NRG1 types I&#8211;VI). All of these isoforms contain an extracellular EGF-like domain; proteolytic cleavage of transmembrane NRG1 is required for the release of the portion of the protein containing this domain, and this soluble form can then bind and activate ErbB receptors (Mei and Nave 2014). NRG1 has a range of biological functions in the central and peripheral nervous systems including the regulation of myelination, radial and tangential neuronal migration (of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons, respectively) and synaptic plasticity (Mei and Nave 2014). Thus, inhibition or loss of BACE1 activity is predicted to alter NRG1-ErbB signalling and, in fact, a number of the phenotypes seen in BACE1 KO mice are attributed to the lack of BACE1 cleavage of NRG1. For example, BACE1 cleavage of neuronally expressed NRG1 type III is required for normal myelination. BACE1 KO mice, as well as zebrafish lacking BACE1, have peripheral hypomyelination (Hu et al. 2006; Willem et al. 2006; Hu et al. 2008; van Bebber et al. 2013), and central hypomyelination has also been reported (Hu et al. 2006). The proteolytic processing of NRG1 type III and the consequences for myelination have been recently reviewed (Fleck et al. 2012; Hu et al. 2016) and will not be described in detail here.NRG1-ErbB4 signalling has been intensively studied since the respective genes encoding these proteins were identified as schizophrenia susceptibility genes (Stefansson et al. 2002; Corvin et al. 2004; Mei and Nave 2014; Mostaid et al. 2016). NRG1 heterozygous mice display schizophrenia-like endophenotypes and impaired hippocampal plasticity (Stefansson et al. 2002; O&#8217;Tuathaigh et al. 2010), and similar schizophrenia-related endophenotypes are seen in BACE1 KO mice (including impaired pre-pulse inhibition, a greater level of hyperactivity induced by a glutamatergic psychostimulant, cognitive impairments and social recognition deficits; Savonenko et al. 2008). A reduction in PSD-95-associated ErbB4 was also observed in these BACE1 KO mice, supporting the idea that the lack of BACE1 processing of NRG1 and subsequent impairment of NRG1-ErbB4 signalling contributed to the phenotypes observed (Savonenko et al. 2008). Taken together, there is strong evidence from NRG1 overexpression and knockout studies in mice (Mostaid et al. 2016) for the association of altered developmental NRG1-ErbB4 signalling with schizophrenia; however, relatively few studies have addressed the role of BACE1-cleaved NRG1 in the mature brain.The persistence of NRG1 and ErbB4 expression in the adult central nervous system, including in neurons of the cortex and hippocampus, indicates ongoing roles for NRG1 signalling in maturity (Mei and Xiong 2008). NRG1-ErbB4 signalling is important in regulating synaptic function at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses. For example, ErbB4 is recruited in an activity-dependent manner to the postsynaptic compartment of hippocampal CA1 excitatory synapses where it is activated by soluble NRG1. Binding of NRG1 enhances ErbB4 association with PSD-95 in the postsynaptic scaffold, strengthening glutamatergic synapses through stabilising synaptic AMPA receptors and maintaining dendritic spine synapses (Li et al. 2007). While loss of NRG1-ErbB4 signalling is detrimental (Li et al. 2007; Agarwal et al. 2014), excessive NRG1-ErbB4 activity (as seen in schizophrenia) is also associated with synaptic dysfunction resulting from suppression of LTP-induced NMDA receptor function (Pitcher et al. 2011; Agarwal et al. 2014; Luo et al. 2014).ErbB4 is also expressed in interneurons in the postnatal and adult brains and is required presynaptically in cortical GABAergic axon terminals for the formation of inhibitory synapses onto pyramidal neurons (Mei and Nave 2014). In dendrites of interneurons, ErbB4 acts postsynaptically at excitatory synapses (Fazzari et al. 2010). Interestingly, deletion of ErbB4 only in fast-spiking interneurons produced neurophysiological and behavioural deficits consistent with schizophrenia endophenotypes (Del Pino et al. 2013). Thus, NRG1 function must be precisely regulated to maintain normal glutamatergic receptor functions at synapses and balanced excitatory-inhibitory neurotransmission in the cortex.Another important ongoing role of BACE1-processed NRG1 and NRG1-ErbB signalling is the maintenance of muscle spindles, sensory receptors that detect changes in muscle length (Cheret et al. 2013). Chronic treatment of adult wild-type mice with a BACE inhibitor led to a substantial loss of spindles and consequent impairment in motor co-ordination (Cheret et al. 2013). Careful assessment of motor function in patients during chronic BACE inhibitor treatment will be necessary to monitor this potential side effect.\nSez6 Family\nThe seizure-related gene 6 (Sez6; also referred to as Seizure 6, Seizure protein 6 and BSRP) family of proteins includes Sez6, Sez6-like (Sez6L) and Sez6-like 2 (Sez6L2). All three family members were identified as BACE1 substrates from a screen that identified proteins shed from cultured neurons using the secretome protein enrichment with click sugars (SPECS) method (Kuhn et al. 2012). Sez6 was validated as a BACE1 substrate, and Sez6 and Sez6L were found to be cleaved predominantly or exclusively by BACE1 (Kuhn et al. 2012). Sez6 is a prime candidate for involvement in the synaptic dysfunction seen with BACE inhibition (Filser et al. 2015) as it is expressed in the adult brain and has known roles in dendrite and spine development (Gunnersen et al. 2007). Given the growing interest in Sez6 family proteins as BACE1 substrates, we have provided a comprehensive coverage of the literature below.Sez6 messenger RNA (mRNA) is upregulated by neuronal activity (Shimizu-Nishikawa et al. 1995b) and predominantly localised to the central nervous system (Shimizu-Nishikawa et al. 1995b; Herbst and Nicklin 1997). High levels of Sez6 protein are found in the developing and postnatal forebrain (Kim et al. 2002; Gunnersen et al. 2007; Osaki et al. 2011), with Sez6 being detected in the somatodendritic compartment of neurons (Miyazaki et al. 2006; Gunnersen et al. 2007). Sez6 mRNA and protein expression remains relatively high in regions of the adult mouse central nervous system including the cortex, hippocampus, striatum, olfactory tubercule (Herbst and Nicklin 1997; Miyazaki et al. 2006; Gunnersen et al. 2007; Osaki et al. 2011), retina (Gunnersen et al. 2009) and spinal cord (B Graham and J Gunnersen, unpublished data). In constitutive Sez6 KO mice, neurons exhibit morphological alterations including an increased number of dendrites and fewer spines (Gunnersen et al. 2007). Both BACE1 KO and Sez6 KO mice have reduced dendritic spine densities (Savonenko et al. 2008; Gunnersen et al. 2007), deficits in hippocampal-dependent learning (Laird et al. 2005; Gunnersen et al. 2007) and motor deficits (Kobayashi et al. 2008; Gunnersen et al. 2007). The Sez6 gene is highly conserved between mice and humans, and sez6 mutations and/or altered expression has been associated with febrile seizures (Yu et al. 2007; Mulley et al. 2011), autism spectrum disorder (Cukier et al. 2014; Mariani et al. 2015), intellectual disability (Gilissen et al. 2014) and childhood-onset schizophrenia (Ambalavanan et al. 2016). Elevated, or decreased, levels of Sez6 in the CSF are observed in adult patients with psychiatric disorders (Maccarrone et al. 2013) and Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (Khoonsari et al. 2016), respectively.Sez6 family proteins are each represented by multiple isoforms. Full-length type I transmembrane protein isoforms consist of a signal sequence, a large extracellular or luminal region containing complement subcomponent C1r/C1s, Uegf, Bmp1 (CUB) domains and sushi (also known as short consensus repeat [SCR] or complement control protein [CCP]) domains, a transmembrane region and a short intracellular region containing an NPxY motif, potential phosphorylation sites (Shimizu-Nishikawa et al. 1995b; Miyazaki et al. 2006) and a potential PDZ protein binding domain at the C-terminus (J Gunnersen, unpublished). The presence of CUB and sushi domains suggests that Sez6 family proteins interact with other central nervous system proteins, and an interaction between Sez6 and the protease neurotrypsin (also known as motopsin) has been reported (Mitsui et al. 2013). From the single sez6 gene, two different transmembrane protein isoforms and a truncated isoform lacking the transmembrane region (secreted) are generated via alternative splicing of the sez6 mRNA (Shimizu-Nishikawa et al. 1995a; Miyazaki et al. 2006). Sez6 transmembrane and secreted isoforms have opposing actions on dendritic outgrowth in vitro (Gunnersen et al. 2007). Overexpression of the full-length transmembrane Sez6 in neurons lacking endogenous Sez6 inhibits neurite outgrowth while secreted Sez6 promotes it. BACE1 cleaves the transmembrane form of Sez6 to produce a shed ectodomain that is similar to (although larger than) the secreted Sez6 isoform (Kuhn et al. 2012). It will be important to determine whether the BACE1-shed Sez6 ectodomain performs a similar functional role to the secreted isoform, as effective BACE inhibition would be expected to block ectodomain shedding while enhancing the levels of the intact transmembrane form, as shown in mice (Kuhn et al. 2012).Like Sez6, Sez6L and Sez6L2 are localised to the somatodendritic compartment of neurons (Miyazaki et al. 2006). Sez6L and Sez6L2 mRNA is found throughout the adult mouse brain in regions including the cortex, hippocampus and olfactory bulb (Miyazaki et al. 2006). Mice lacking all Sez6 family members (triple KO mice) have significant motor co-ordination deficits attributed to abnormal climbing fibre innervation in the cerebellum; loss of Sez6L appears to be mostly responsible for this phenotype. The lack of reported phenotypes in the single KO mouse lines in this study indicates a level of functional redundancy between Sez6 family members (Miyazaki et al. 2006). Nevertheless, knockdown of individual Sez6 family members results in decreased calcium spiking frequency and amplitude in cultured neurons (Anderson et al. 2012).Sez6L was also identified by Kuhn et al. (2012) as a BACE substrate using SPECS. Although not yet validated by other means, further investigation is warranted as, like Sez6, it is predominantly cleaved by BACE1 rather than other proteases (Kuhn et al. 2012). Little is known about its neuronal function although Sez6L mRNA is widely expressed in the adult brain in regions including the cortex and hippocampus (Miyazaki et al. 2006). Sez6L is linked to bipolar disorder (Xu et al. 2013). Outside the central nervous system, sez6L genetic variants are associated with multiple cancer types, inflammation and cardiovascular disease. Sez6L2 has been linked to autism (Kumar et al. 2009; Konyukh et al. 2011; Chapman et al. 2015) and is likely to play an important role in central nervous system development. Levels of the shed Sez6L2 ectodomain are decreased in the CSF of BACE1 KO mice (Dislich et al. 2015), although Sez6L2 is likely to be cleaved by other proteases in addition to BACE1 (Kuhn et al. 2012) and cathepsin D is one such protease (Boonen et al. 2016). In this report, Sez6L2 was identified as a transport receptor for cathepsin D, an aspartyl protease found in lysosomes, and was localised to endosomes, the trans-Golgi network and the plasma membrane. Similarly to Sez6, full-length and proteolytically cleaved Sez6L2 exhibited opposing effects on neuronal differentiation and neurite outgrowth in neuroblastoma cells (Boonen et al. 2016). Sez6L and Sez6L2 are expressed in the pancreas where they are BACE2 but not BACE1 substrates, demonstrating the tissue-specific cleavage of these proteins. The CTFs of BACE2-cleaved Sez6L and Sez6L2 are subsequently cleaved by &#947;-secretase (St&#252;tzer et al. 2013), raising the possibility that Sez6 family proteins may undergo this secondary cleavage in the central nervous system.To understand how Sez6 family proteins contribute to the synaptic deficits seen with BACE inhibition, we need to investigate more fully the functions of uncleaved Sez6 and the BACE1-cleaved Sez6 ectodomain, and learn more about the roles of Sez6L and Sez6L2 in the adult central nervous system.\nCHL1 and L1\nL1 (also called L1 cell adhesion molecule) and close homologue of L1 (CHL1) are members of the L1 family of cell adhesion molecules and part of the immunoglobulin superfamily. CHL1 and L1 are type I transmembrane proteins which are widely expressed in neurons, particularly in the developing central nervous system where they facilitate neurite outgrowth, axonal targeting and cell migration (Hillenbrand et al. 1999; Maness and Schachner 2007). CHL1 and L1 cleavage by ADAM proteases alters their function, likely through the release of extracellular fragments or reduction of cell adhesion (Maness and Schachner 2007). CHL1 and L1 were identified as neuronal BACE1 substrates through proteomic screening (Kuhn et al. 2012; Zhou et al. 2012), and they have been validated as physiological BACE1 substrates in vivo (Hitt et al. 2012; Kuhn et al. 2012; Zhou et al. 2012; Dislich et al. 2015).Neuronal CHL1 is enriched in the axonal membrane (Leshchyns&#8217;ka et al. 2006), and co-localisation with BACE1 is observed in growth cones in vitro and pre-synaptic terminals in the postnatal mouse brain (Hitt et al. 2012). Similar hippocampal mossy fibre and olfactory sensory neuron axon guidance defects are observed in constitutive CHL1 KO (Montag-Sallaz et al. 2002) and BACE1 KO mice (Rajapaksha et al. 2011; Cao et al. 2012; Hitt et al. 2012), suggesting that BACE1 processing of CHL1 is required for normal axon targeting. BACE1 cleavage of CHL1 has been shown to contribute to growth cone collapse through interactions of the CHL1-CTF with the axonal guidance molecule semaphorin 3A (Bar&#227;o et al. 2015).CHL1 expression decreases following development but persists in the mature central nervous system (Hillenbrand et al. 1999), indicating an ongoing function of CHL1 in the adult brain. CHL1 has a demonstrated role in synaptic transmission: CHL1 accumulates in the pre-synaptic membrane and, through an association of the CHL1 intracellular domain with the chaperone Hsc70, regulates the uncoating of clathrin-coated synaptic vesicles (Leshchyns&#8217;ka et al. 2006). Conditional KO mice, in which CHL1 was ablated in excitatory forebrain neurons following postnatal development, exhibited an impaired working memory duration (Kolata et al. 2008) indicating a role for CHL1 in this process in the mature brain. Similarly, L1 is expressed in neurons of the adult brain including the cerebral cortex and hippocampus (Hillenbrand et al. 1999; Horinouchi et al. 2005). Conditional KO mice in which L1 is deleted in mature excitatory forebrain neurons do not display the severe developmental abnormalities seen in constitutive L1 KO mice (Maness and Schachner 2007). However, conditional L1 KO mice display increased basal excitatory activity in hippocampal CA1 and use different search strategies in the Morris water maze, indicating an alteration in place learning (Law et al. 2003).\nAPP Family\nThe APP peptide A&#951;-&#945;, while not a BACE1 product, is detrimental to neuronal function and is increased in the presence of BACE inhibitors as discussed previously (Willem et al. 2015). Full-length APP and its peptide products also have non-toxic physiological roles related to cell adhesion, intracellular signalling, synaptic function and more, reviewed in detail elsewhere (M&#252;ller and Zheng 2012; Nhan et al. 2015). Cleavage of APP by &#945;-secretase or BACE1 leads to the release of soluble ectodomains APPs&#945; and APPs&#946;, respectively. APPs&#945; has synaptotropic and neuroprotective properties; however, APPs&#946; has not been shown to have the same potent effect on synapses (Hick et al. 2015; Nhan et al. 2015). The cytoplasmic domain of APP also has a demonstrated role in normal synaptic function (Klevanski et al. 2015). Within the same gene family are amyloid precursor-like protein 1 (APLP1) and amyloid precursor-like protein 2 (APLP2), expressed in the adult brain (Lorent et al. 1995). APLP1 and APLP2 are also type I transmembrane proteins that undergo cleavage by secretases, including BACE1 (Eggert et al. 2004; Li and S&#252;dhof 2004; Hogl et al. 2011), to produce a soluble ectodomain, intracellular domain and other (non-A&#946;) peptide fragments. Neuronal APLP1 is almost exclusively cleaved by BACE1 (Kuhn et al. 2012); however, relatively little is known about its function. Constitutive APLP1 KO mice display altered synaptic transmission in the dentate gyrus, but to date, there is no clear role for APLP1 in synaptic plasticity (Vnencak et al. 2015). Further study is needed to determine how BACE processing affects APLP1 function.\nAdditional BACE1 Substrates\nOther potential BACE1 substrates with known roles in synaptic function have been identified in proteolytic screens but await validation in vitro or in vivo. For example, neuroligin 1&#945;, neuroligin 2, neuroligin 4 and neurexin 1&#945;, well-known synaptic cell adhesion molecules, have been identified as likely neuronal BACE1 substrates (Kuhn et al. 2012; Bemben et al. 2015). BACE1 substrates also include proteins that influence the excitability of neurons, including the &#946;-subunits of voltage-gated sodium channels (Wong et al. 2005; Kim et al. 2007; Gersbacher et al. 2010) and subunits of voltage-gated potassium channel proteins, KCNE1 and KCNE2 (Sachse et al. 2013). The BACE1 substrate contactin-2 (Kuhn et al. 2012; Zhou et al. 2012) is a cell adhesion molecule that, together with CASPR2, maintains voltage-gated potassium channels at juxtaparanodal regions of myelinated axons (Poliak et al. 2003). Additionally, while BACE1 primarily acts as a protease, BACE1 can interact non-proteolytically with voltage-dependent sodium channels (Huth et al. 2009) and KCNQ potassium channels (Hessler et al. 2015). Therefore, BACE blockade may alter neuronal excitability through multiple mechanisms.\nNeuronal Localisation of BACE1\nIdentifying the subcellular compartments in which BACE1 interacts with APP and its additional substrates may promote the development of BACE inhibitors that are &#8216;substrate sparing&#8217;, if adverse mechanism-based side effects of this treatment are found.BACE1 is expressed in neurons in multiple areas of the healthy and diseased adult brain, including the cortex and hippocampus (Vassar et al. 1999; Fukumoto et al. 2002). In human and mouse neurons, BACE1 is detected in the axonal and somatodendritic compartments; in mouse neurons, BACE1 is transported to, and enriched in, axons (Buggia-Pr&#233;vot et al. 2013; Buggia-Pr&#233;vot et al. 2014). BACE1 is prominent in pre-synaptic terminals, and levels are high in the terminals of dystrophic neurites surrounding A&#946; plaques (Laird et al. 2005; Zhao et al. 2007; Kandalepas et al. 2013; Sadleir et al. 2016).BACE1 activity is greatest at acidic pH and can be indirectly inhibited with drugs, such as bepridil, which alkalize the membrane-proximal areas of acidic organelles (Mitterreiter et al. 2010). A recent study by Das et al. (2016) determined that the main subcellular interaction sites of BACE1 and APP in cultured hippocampal neurons depend on the neuronal compartment. In dendrites, including dendritic spines, interaction is most frequent in recycling endosomes with fewer interactions occurring in early endosomal, lysosomal and Golgi vesicles. In axons, the majority of BACE1-APP interactions occur in Golgi-derived vesicles (Das et al. 2016). Validated BACE1 substrates have varied subcellular locations. For example CHL1, L1 and contactin-2 are enriched in axons while Sez6 is localised to the somatodendritic compartment (Gunnersen et al. 2007). Sez6 has been shown to be internalised from the surface of cultured neurons and to be present in transferrin receptor (TfR)-positive early/recycling endosomes (Carrodus et al. 2014); however, further experiments are required to determine whether this compartment is the site of the BACE1-Sez6 interaction.Identification of the BACE1 substrates that are required for normal synaptic function in the mature brain and elucidation of their subcellular locations will help determine strategies to modify the BACE inhibition approach, if required. For example, experimental approaches to decrease A&#946; production while minimising the blockade of key BACE1 substrates include altering the trafficking of BACE1 (Kizuka et al. 2015) and using an endosomally targeted BACE inhibitor (Ben Halima et al. 2016). However, it is possible that the latter strategy will not spare all substrates, as Sez6 family proteins are also abundant in endosomes (Miyazaki et al. 2006; Carrodus et al. 2014).\nSummary\nBACE inhibitors for the treatment of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease are progressing through clinical trials. If this strategy is found to be effective in preventing or reducing cognitive decline in Alzheimer&#8217;s disease patients, considerations for the use of BACE inhibitors include identifying the stage at which the treatment should begin, determining the ideal levels of BACE inhibition at different disease stages and investigating the benefit of combining BACE inhibitors with additional therapeutic strategies. Furthermore, a level of caution surrounds the BACE inhibitor strategy as BACE1 has a number of other substrates in addition to APP. It is imperative that we understand the effects of altered BACE1 cleavage of key substrates and, if warranted, aim to adapt the BACE inhibitor strategy to minimise mechanism-based side effects. Therefore, gaining a better understanding of the fundamental roles of BACE1 substrates in the adult brain and how (and in which subcellular compartments) BACE1 cleavage modulates these functions is of the utmost importance.", "pmid": "27456313", "title": "Functions of the Alzheimer&#8217;s Disease Protease BACE1 at the Synapse in the Central Nervous System", "journal_title": "Journal of Molecular Neuroscience", "authors": "Kathryn M.

Changes from pre-treatment scores in International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), IPSS-quality of life (QoL) score, maximum urinary flow rate (Qmax), and the five-item version of the International Index of Erectile Function questionnaire (IIEF-5) were assessed at 3 and 6&#160;months.

There is a direct relationship between LUTS and age, with an overall prevalence of >50% in men aged &#10878;50&#160;years [2], [3]. The prevalence of erectile dysfunction (ED) is also similarly high and increases with age. About 35% of men aged 40&#8211;70&#160;years have moderate to complete ED, which is strongly related to age and other co-morbidities such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and depression [4]. LUTS due to BPH (LUTS/BPH) and ED are common disorders among ageing men, with a striking relationship. In addition, both have a significant negative impact on quality of life (QoL) [5]. In their meta-analysis of 12 randomised controlled trials (RCTs), Gacci et al. [6] reported that the combination of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5-Is) and &#945;1-adrenergic receptor blockers significantly improved the IPSS [standardised mean difference (SMD) &#8722;1.8, 95% CI &#8722;3.7 to 0.0; P&#160;=&#160;0.05] and International Erectile Function score (SMD +3.6, 95% CI +3.1 to +4.1; P&#160;<&#160;0.001), as well as Qmax (SMD +1.5&#160;mL/s, 95% CI +0.9 to +2.2; P&#160;<&#160;0.001) when compared with the use of &#945;1-adrenergic receptor blockers alone.Our aim in the present study was to assess the additive effect of sildenafil citrate to tamsulosin in the treatment of LUTS/BPH in men with or without ED in a prospective, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind study.\nPatients and methods\n\nPatient enrolment\nThis study was conducted between May 2013 and May 2014. Approval from our ethics committee was obtained and a written consent was signed by each patient before the study. In all, 150 patients who were diagnosed with LUTS/BPH were enrolled. The inclusion criteria were: (i) patients who were recently diagnosed LUTS/BPH without any history of medical or surgical intervention for BPH, (ii) no absolute indication for surgical intervention, (iii) patients with or without ED, (4) a PSA level of <4&#160;ng/dL, and (v) a body mass index (BMI) of &#10877;30&#160;kg/m2, as obesity is a risk factor for both ED and male LUTS. The exclusion criteria were: (i) patients with significant cardiovascular disease, neurological, and psychiatric disorders, (ii) history of hypersensitivity and contraindication to one of the study drugs, (iii) patients with confirmed prostatic malignancy or any other active urinary tract disease, (iv) participation in another clinical trial in the 3&#160;months prior to the study.\nStudy design\nThis study was a prospective, two-armed, randomised, double-blind (was carried out by relevant outpatient clinic pharmacist who provided us with a sealed randomisation list that was unblinded at the end of follow-up), placebo-controlled (placebo prepared by the Pharmaceutics Department in a tablet formulation similar to the original drug but without any active ingredients), comparative study between tamsulosin 0.4&#160;mg once daily (OD) at day time plus sildenafil 25&#160;mg OD at night and tamsulosin 0.4&#160;mg OD at day time plus placebo at night in the treatment of patients with LUTS/BPH. Patients who fulfilled the entry criteria at selection were randomised into the two groups. Patients were randomly assigned blinded medication (placebo or sildenafil, plus tamsulosin) using a computer generated pseudorandom code in a 1:1 ratio by the study centre with a fixed block size of four.\nMain outcome measures\nThe primary endpoint was clinical efficacy assessments for LUTS/BPH, which were evaluated by the IPSS and QoL score. The secondary endpoints were maximum urinary flow rate (Qmax); erectile function evaluated using the five-item version of the International Index of Erectile Function questionnaire (IIEF-5);safety profiles, which were assessed by physical examination (heart rate and blood pressure), and monitoring clinical adverse events i.e. tolerability. The results of the IPSS&#160;+&#160;QoL score, Qmax and IIEF-5 were used to evaluate related symptoms before treatment and at 3 and 6&#160;months after treatment in both groups.\nStatistical analysis\nThe sample size was calculated based on an observed difference of 3.2 points on average in the IPSS between the two treatment groups [7]. Considering the expected attrition rate to be 10%, therefore, a total sample size of 150 (75 patients in each group) was calculated to provide a power of 90% and a two-sided type I error of 0.05 (95% CI), with 1:1 allocation ratio between groups. G*Power V3.1.9 was used in the calculation [8] (University of D&#252;sseldorf, Germany). Data are expressed as the mean (SD). The percentage change in the IPSS and IIEF-5 score was calculated by determining the mean IPSS and IIEF-5 score (before, and at 3 and 6&#160;months after treatment) then: mean before treatment &#8211; mean at 3/6&#160;months after treatment/mean before treatment&#160;&#215;&#160;100. Statistical analyses were carried out using the chi-square test, analysis of covariance, and independent and paired t-tests. All analyses were two-tailed, with a significance level of 5%. Analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS&#174;) 20.0 software package (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).\nResults\n\nStudy population\nA Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) flow chart is shown in Fig. 1. In all, 150 patients were randomised to receive tamsulosin&#160;+&#160;sildenafil (75 men) referred to as Group A or tamsulosin&#160;+&#160;placebo (75) referred to as Group B. Among the 150 men enrolled, 142 (94.7%) completed the 3-month follow-up evaluation (Group A: 70/75; Group B: 72/75), and 131 patients (87.3%) finished the 6-month follow-up evaluation (Group A: 63/75; Group B: 68/75). All the patients&#8217; baseline characteristics including: age, BMI, IPSS, Qmax, post-void residual urine volume (PVR), and IIEF-5 were not significantly different between the groups and are given in Table 1.\nEfficacy on IPSS, QoL and \n\nIPSS changes (\nAt the 3-month follow-up, the mean (SD) IPSS was 14.7 (5) in Group A and 18.9 (4.4) in Group B. Thus, the IPSSs were significantly improved (P&#160;<&#160;0.001) in both groups, but this improvement was more marked in Group A (&#8722;29.3%) than in Group B (&#8722;13.7%).At the 6-month follow-up, the mean (SD) IPSS was 13.1 (4.5) in Group A and 17.6 (4.1) in Group B. Thus, the IPSSs were still significantly improved (P&#160;<&#160;0.001) in both groups, but this improvement was again more marked in Group A (&#8722;37%) than in Group B (&#8722;19.6%).So, this means that the IPSSs were significantly improved in Group A compared to Group B (P&#160;=&#160;0.039 and 0.043 at the 3- and 6-month follow-up, respectively). The 6-month scores were not significantly improved compared with the 3-month scores in either of the groups (P&#160;=&#160;0.056 and 0.073 for Groups A and B, respectively).\nQoL score changes\nThe QoL score before treatment showed no significant difference between the two treatments. In Group A, the 3- and 6-month follow-up scores were greatly reduced compared to the score before treatment (both P&#160;<&#160;0.001). In Group B there was also a significant difference in the 3- and 6-month follow-up scores compared with the score before treatment (both P&#160;<&#160;0.05). The patients&#8217; QoL was improved, with QoL scores being significantly decreased in Group A more so than in Group B at both the 3- and 6-month follow-ups.\nNone\nAt the 3-month follow-up, the mean (SD) Qmax was 14.3 (2.9)&#160;mL/s in Group A and 12.4 (2.4)&#160;mL/s in Group B. At the 6-month follow-up, the mean (SD) Qmax was 14.9 (3)&#160;mL/s in Group A and 12.9 (2.4)&#160;mL/sin Group B. The Qmax was significantly improved (P&#160;<&#160;0.001) at the 3- and 6-month follow-ups in both groups, but this improvement was more marked in Group A (30% and 35.5% at the 3- and 6-month follow-up, respectively) than in Group B (20.4% and 25.2% at the 3- and 6-month follow-up, respectively). There was no significant difference between both groups for Qmax score improvements (P&#160;=&#160;0.261 and P&#160;=&#160;0.274 at the 3- and 6-month follow-up, respectively). The 6-month scores were not significantly better than the 3-month scores in either group (P&#160;=&#160;0.243 and P&#160;=&#160;0.220 for Groups A and B, respectively).\nEfficacy on erectile function\n\nIIEF-5 score changes (\nAt the 3-month follow-up, the mean (SD) IIEF-5 score was 22.4 (2.6) in Group A and 15.3 (3.4) in Group B. At the 6-month follow-up, the mean (SD) IIEF-5 score was 22.9 (2.3) in Group A and 15.4 (3.3) in Group B. The IIEF-5 score was highly significantly improved (P&#160;<&#160;0.001 at both the 3- and 6-month OD follow-ups) in Group A, whilst it was also significantly improved in Group B (P&#160;=&#160;0.017 and P&#160;=&#160;0.012 at the 3- and 6-month follow-ups, respectively). This improvement was more marked in Group A (58.7% and 62.4% at the 3- and 6-month follow-up, respectively) than in Group B (11.7% and 12.4% at the 3- and 6-month follow-ups, respectively). The IIEF-5 scores were highly significantly improved in Group A vs Group B (P&#160;<&#160;0.001 at both the 3- and 6-month follow-ups).\nSafety\nOf the 150 patients that took the study drugs for up to 6&#160;months, 19 (12.7%) discontinued treatment because they were lost to follow-up (five men) or had adverse events (14). Nine patients in Group A had 11 adverse events (flushing, four; headache, two; dyspepsia, one; dizziness, two; gastric upset, two), and five patients in Group B had dizziness. There were no serious adverse events reported during the study and there was also no evidence of either significant hypotension or syncope during the 6-month treatment period.\nDiscussion\nIn ageing males, BPH and ED are common diseases. There is a high probability of BPH occurring concurrently with ED [9], [10]. PDE5-Is are first-line medications for ED, and &#945;1-adrenergic receptor blockers are highly effective in the management of LUTS/BPH. Close observation of both pathological conditions and medication-based treatments have been the first-line therapy for LUTS/BPH [11]. The pathophysiology of male LUTS is highly complex, multifactorial and still not completely understood [12]. The relationship between male LUTS/BPH and ED is supported by many theories: (i) autonomic hyperactivity and metabolic syndrome hypothesis, (ii) impaired nitric oxide/cyclic guanine monophosphate (NO/cGMP) signalling pathway in the prostate and penis, (iii) increased rho-kinase activation/endothelin pathway, (iv) pelvic atherosclerosis and ischaemia [13], [14]. Notably, PDE5-Is have received much attention in the treatment of LUTS/BPH. This could be due to: (i) selective distribution of PDE5 that is mostly expressed and biologically active in the muscular compartment with the following rank order of activity: bladder neck&#160;>&#160;prostatic urethra&#160;>&#160;prostate [15], (ii) PDE5-Is increase NO levels in smooth muscle mediating its relaxation in the corpus cavernosum and bladder, thus facilitating penile erection plus bladder neck and prostate relaxation [16], (iii) PDE5-Is ameliorate the dynamic component (bladder dysfunction and urethral contractions) of male LUTS as they induce inhibition of the rho A/rho-kinase contractile mechanism in the bladder [17], (iv) PDE5-Is can restore morphological and functional changes in the bladder and prostate induced by chronic pelvic ischaemia, as PDE5 is highly expressed in the pelvic vasculature [18], [19]. These findings suggest that the concurrent administration of an &#945;1-adrenergic receptor blocker and a PDE-5I to patients with LUTS/BPH with or without ED may potentiate, or improve to some extent, the beneficial effects of each drug administered alone.In the Kaplan et al. [20] study, improvements in the IPSS were significant for all three treatments but were the greatest for the combined therapy. They reported that after treatment with alfuzosin monotherapy (10&#160;mg OD), sildenafil monotherapy (25&#160;mg OD) or a combination of the two drugs for 12&#160;weeks in patients with previously untreated LUTS and ED, that Qmax, PVR and storage symptoms were significantly improved with alfuzosin alone and with the combined treatment. For IIEF scores, improvements were significant for sildenafil alone but greater with the combined treatment and was not significant for alfuzosin alone. Likewise, increases in the frequency of penetration and maintained erections were greater in the combined therapy group than in the alfuzosin or sildenafil alone groups [20]. These investigations showed that the combined use of a PDE5-I and &#945;1-adrenergic receptor blocker might be more effective than monotherapy with either agent [7].Liu et al. [21] in their review and meta-analysis of five RCTs assessing the use of PDE5-Is alone vs placebo in men with LUTS/BPH concluded that PDE5-Is are effective and safe, and should be used as a first-line for treating men with coincidental LUTS/ED. Laydner et al. [22] reported a significant improvement in both urinary and erectile function, without a change in Qmax, in a systematic review without meta-analysis, including four trials on PDE5-Is alone in men with LUTS/BPH. Finally, Martinez-Salamanca et al. [23], analysed the role of combined therapy with PDE5-Is and &#945;1-adrenergic receptor blockers, reporting a significant improvement in urinary symptoms with no evidence of an effect on urodynamic parameters, in a non-systematic descriptive review [23].In our present study, IPSSs were significantly improved in the two groups, but this improvement was more marked with combined therapy than for &#945;1-adrenergic receptor blocker alone, and the 6-month scores were insignificantly improved compared to the 3-month scores in the two groups. These results are consistent with those of Kaplan et al. [20] and Zhe et al. [7].In the present study, Qmax was significantly improved at the 3- and 6-month follow-ups in both groups, but this improvement was more marked with combined therapy (Group A) than for &#945;1-adrenergic receptor blocker alone (Group B). Qmax was improved in both treatment groups and was not significantly different, and the 6-month scores were insignificantly improved compared to 3-month scores in both groups.One of the most remarkable outcomes of the Gacciet al. [6] meta-analysis of 12 RCTs was that the combination of PDE5-Is and &#945;1-adrenergic receptor blockers could significantly improve Qmax as compared with &#945;1-adrenergic receptor blockers alone. Improvement of Qmax above 1&#160;mL/s in combined therapy, as compared with &#945;1-adrenergic receptor alone, was reported by all authors in the previous study [6].Limitations of the present study are the relatively small population size, short follow-up duration (6&#160;months) and thus no long-term efficacy endpoints, and the dose of sildenafil citrate used (25&#160;mg OD) is experimental. Thus further prospective studies with longer durations of follow-up are recommended.\nConclusion\nSildenafil citrate in combination with tamsulosin improved LUTS, erectile function, and patient QoL more than tamsulosin monotherapy with the merit of a comparable safety profile in patients with LUTS/BPH.\nFinancial disclosure\nNone.\nConflict of interest\nNone.", "pmid": "28275519", "title": "Sildenafil citrate in combination with tamsulosin versus tamsulosin monotherapy for management of male lower urinary tract symptoms due to benign prostatic hyperplasia: A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial", "journal_title": "Arab Journal of Urology", "authors": "Amr Fawzi;Mostafa Kamel;Emad Salem;Esam Desoky;Mohamed Omran;Hazem Elgalaly;Ahmed Sakr;Aref Maarouf;Salem Khalil", "doi": "10.1016/j.aju.2016.11.001", "score": "0.00795275"}, {"keywords": "bronchial artery embolization;bronchoscopy;extravasation;life\u2010threatening;massive hemoptysis", "abstract": "Cases\nCase 1: A 63&#8208;year&#8208;old woman was referred for coughing blood.

From that experience, we noted hemoptysis during angiography using bronchoscopy in Case 2, enabling prompt bronchial artery embolization.", "body": "Introduction\nWe report two cases with good outcomes following successful ventilation maintenance during asphyxia and airway management following bleeding point identification, combined with hemostatic therapy using bronchial artery embolization (BAE). Similar cases are reviewed.\nCases\n\nCase 1\nA healthy non&#8208;smoking 63&#8208;year&#8208;old woman was examined for coughing blood. Detailed findings including upper gastrointestinal endoscopy denied hematemesis. Respiratory status worsened with hemoptysis and she was referred to us under artificial respiration and endotracheal intubation. Chest X&#8208;ray and computed tomography findings at admission revealed a right lung field infiltrative shadow (Fig. 1A). Bronchial angiography showed dilatation >2 mm on the proximal side of the right main bronchial artery. Diffuse angiectasis >0.5 mm was also depicted on the distal side (Fig. 1B) and bronchoscopic findings showed massive blood clots in the right main bronchus (Fig. 1C). However, hemoptysis cause, such as tumors, could not be determined. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for observation; hemostasis was confirmed by bronchoscopy, although the bleeding amount was unknown, while cardiorespiratory dynamics under sedation were stable. The next day, she suffered massive hemoptysis triggered by coughing and showed severely poor ventilation caused by asphyxia. One&#8208;lung ventilation was obtained by inserting an endotracheal tube into the left main bronchus to temporarily secure ventilation (Fig. 1D). Following emergency bronchial angiography, the culprit vessel was detected using a microcatheter. Bronchial artery embolization was carried out using gelatine sponge particles (Fig. 1E) and the endotracheal tube was repositioned to ~4 cm from the trachea bifurcation. The patient was then returned to the ICU. As anemia progressed, a transfusion was carried out on hospital day 4, after which she was weaned from ventilatory support on day 6 and discharged on day 13.\nCase 2\nA 72&#8208;year&#8208;old man with a history of diabetes and smoking vomited up blood a few hours after the subjective sign of coughing. He was transported on an emergency basis to our center as a referral. Respiratory status was stable on admission and he underwent chest contrast&#8208;enhanced computed tomography without intubation, which revealed only ground&#8208;glass opacity dominant in the right lung field (Fig. 2A). No vascular abnormality nor extravascular leakage was noted. An episode of massive hemoptysis (200 mL in 4 h) was confirmed, thus BAE was prepared while carrying out endotracheal intubation and providing artificial respiratory care for enabling bronchoscopy during interventional radiology. As in Case 1, vascular dilatation >2 mm was found on the proximal side, while the vascular abnormality in the periphery showed diffuse spreading (Fig. 2B). The hemoptysis&#8208;causing vessel and bleeding point could not be located for undertaking BAE. While securing airway safety, blood clots were aspirated with bronchoscopy during angiography, resulting in confirmation of massive foamy hemoptysis (Fig. 2C). Intercostal angiography carried out at that time also revealed extravascular leakage from the lobar bronchus to right main bronchus (Fig. 2D, Video S1). Because of anastomosis of the intercostal artery and the right bronchial artery as the causative vessel, we considered that contrast media might leak from the lesion into the airway. A comparison of angiographic findings of the right bronchial artery before and after aspiration confirmed visible changes in the vascular abnormality (Fig. 2B, E) in the periphery after removing blood clots, and the culprit vessel causing massive hemoptysis was identified. Embolization of the right bronchial artery was carried out using Gelfoam (Fig. 2F). Immediately after interventional radiology completion, the endotracheal tube was removed. The patient returned to the ICU for follow&#8208;up observations and no hemoptysis recurrence was noted. Bloody expectoration improved and he was discharged on hospital day 10.\nDiscussion\nIt has been reported that hemoptysis from the bronchial arterial system accounts for 90% of airway hemoptysis cases,1, 2 for which BAE has been established as a therapeutic option. However, the utility of bleeding site identification by bronchoscopy before BAE may be limited and the procedure might not always be necessary,3 although extravascular leakage detection provides convincing evidence. In Case 2, BAE was carried out, as we detected extravascular leakage during blot clot removal by bronchoscopy while monitoring changes in angiography of the culprit vessel in the bronchial artery periphery (Fig. 2B, E).Bronchial arterial dilation &#8805;2 mm on the proximal side and &#8805;0.5 mm on the distal side indicate a vascular abnormality,4 with tortuosity and hyperplasia also generally seen. Bronchial artery embolization is generally accepted for such evidently abnormal vessels. However, paraplegia resulting from embolization of the artery of Adamkiewicz is widely known as a complication of BAE, although the incidence is as low as 1%.2, 5 This causes hesitation in proceeding with BAE if there is doubt that it is necessary. As seen in Case 1, although a vascular abnormality was identified in the initial angiography findings, it was difficult to determine BAE because of a lack of information regarding bleeding amount.The frequency of extravascular leakage detection by bronchial arteriography for providing evidence for BAE is not high regardless of the clinical situation,6, 7 as that has been reported in 5 of 140 (3.6%)8 and 3 of 28 (10.7%)3 cases. Moreover, no known reports have confirmed extravascular leakage during a bronchoscopic examination for removing blood clots. Accordingly, it is significant that we clarified extravascular leakage using the present method. In Case 1, comparisons of angiograms performed twice failed to confirm changes in the culprit vessel in the right bronchial artery periphery (Fig. 1B), which also occurred in Case 2 (Fig. 2B, E). As hemostasis with one&#8208;lung ventilation was effective in the second angiography procedure in Case 1, it is likely that changes shown in Case 2 revealed minute extravascular leakage.Asphyxia is a physiological mechanism showing worsening of airway hemoptysis, with massive airway hemoptysis defined as 100 mL/24 h or more.9 In 2008, Ibrahim proposed that this condition should be recognized and termed not as &#8220;massive&#8221;, but rather &#8220;life&#8208;threatening&#8221; hemoptysis.10 In Case 1, bronchial angiography was undertaken twice before deciding on BAE. During our decision&#8208;making process, the patient experienced potentially life&#8208;threatening worsening due to asphyxia. However, in Case 2, we soon recognized the life&#8208;threatening state of airway hemoptysis, even though it was massive hemoptysis, and promptly carried out bronchoscope&#8208;assisted BAE under general anesthesia, which also shortened the periods of artificial respiration and hospitalization.Our procedure has limitations, including risk of asphyxia, although that is highly predictable when aspirating with a bronchoscope. Accordingly, countermeasures such as control of bleeding from the airway side by using a blocker and quick introduction of extracorporeal circulation with an oxygenator should be prepared.\nConclusion\nWe treated massive airway hemoptysis by extensive airway care including one&#8208;lung ventilation, and observation and treatment with a bronchoscope. From our experience with difficulty in identifying the bleeding point and performing hemostatic therapy in Case 1, we promptly commenced therapy with BAE in Case 2, based on identification of bleeding with bronchoscopy during angiography.\nConflicts of interest\nNone.\nSupporting information\n", "pmid": "29123846", "title": "Two cases of cryptogenic life&#8208;threatening hemoptysis &#8211; identification and management of bleeding point", "journal_title": "Acute Medicine & Surgery", "authors": "Kazunori Okuda;Jun Tanaka;Jun Okamoto;Fumihisa Kishi;Junichiro Nakagawa;Hiroshi Hino;Satoru Chujoh;Kazuhisa Shimadzu;Masafumi Kishimoto;Noboru Kato;Shigeru Shiono", "doi": "10.1002/ams2.227", "score": "0.007830698"}, {"keywords": "Nursing;Systematic review;Speech recognition;Interactive voice response systems;Human transcriptions;Health professionals", "abstract": "Background\nTo undertake a systematic review of existing literature relating to speech recognition technology and its application within health care.Methods\nA systematic review of existing literature from 2000 was undertaken.

Pioneering studies relating to technologies for producing and using written or spoken text, known as computational linguistics, natural language processing, human language technologies, or text mining, were published in the 1970s and 1980s [3&#8211;10]. Highlights of the 1990s and early 2000s include the MedLEE Medical Language Extraction and Encoding System to parse patient records and map them to a coded medical ontology [11] and the Autocoder system to generate medical diagnosis codes from a patient record [12]. Today, a literature search using Pubmed for computational linguistics, natural language processing, human language technologies, or text mining recovers over 20,000 references.Health informatics or eHealth solutions enable clinical data to become potentially accessible through computer networks for the purposes of improving health outcomes for patients and creating efficiencies for health professionals [13&#8211;16]. Language technologies hold the potential for making information easier to understand and access [17].Speech recognition, in particular, presents some interesting applications. Speech recognition (SR) systems compose of microphones (converting sound into electrical signals), sound cards (that digitalise the electrical signals) and speech engine software (that convert the data into text words) [18]. As early as 1975 speech recognition systems were described &#8216;in which isolated words, spoken by a designed talker, are recognized through calculation of a minimum prediction residual&#8217; [19] reporting a 97.3 per cent recognition rate for a male speaker. Applications have been demonstrated in radiology [20] with the authors noting a reduction in turnaround time of reports from 15.7&#160;hours to 4.7&#160;hours, although some difficulties with integration of systems have also been identified [21]. Document processing within endocrinology and psychiatry including physicians and their secretaries also demonstrated improvements in productivity [22]. Similar approaches have recently been applied in the reporting of surgical pathology with improvements in &#8216;turnaround time from 4 to 3&#160;days&#8217; and &#8216;cases signed out in 1&#160;day improved from 22% to 37%&#8217; [23]. These authors also alluded to the issue of correction of errors and the use of templates [23] for processing of information.Although systematic reviews of health informatics [24&#8211;27] have been conducted, surprisingly we were unable to locate such a review on speech recognition in health care.\nAim\nThe aim of this study was to undertake a systematic review of existing literature relating to SR applications, including the identification of the range of systems, implementation or training requirements, accuracy of information transfer, patient outcomes, and staff considerations. This review will inform all health professionals about the possible opportunities and challenges this technology offers.\nMethods\nAll discoverable studies published in the refereed literature from the year 2000 and in English language only were included in the review. We believed that only studies from 2000 onwards would use speech recognition technology that was sufficiently accurate to be suitable for health care settings. Papers were included if they referred to speech recognition in health care settings, being used by health professionals (allied health, medicine, nursing, technical or support staff), with an evaluation of patient or staff outcomes. All research designs, experimental and non-experimental, were included. Studies were excluded if they were opinion papers or describing technical aspects of a system without evaluation. Methods for searching the literature, inclusion criteria, and general appraisal and analysis approaches were specified in advance in an unregistered review protocol.\nData sources (Search strategy)\nSix databases (Ebscohost including CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE including the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, OVID Technologies, PreMED-LINE, PsycINFO) were searched by a qualified health librarian trained in systematic review searches, using the following search terms: &#8220;automatic speech recognition&#8221;, &#8220;Speech Recognition Software&#8221;, &#8220;interactive voice response systems&#8221;, &#8220;((voice or speech) adj (recogni* or respon*)).tw.&#8221;, &#8220;(qualitative* or quantitative* or mixed method* or descriptive* or research*).tw.&#8221;. It should be noted that EMBASE includes 1000 conference proceedings (grey material) also. In addition, a search was undertaken for grey literature in Open Grey. Examples of the searches undertaken from three major databases are presented in Table&#160;1.Table 1\nSearch strategies OVID Embase, Medline, PreMedline\n\nOVID Embase\n1automatic speech recognition/4692((voice or speech) adj (recogni* or respon*)).tw.25163or/1-2274904exp research/3804835(qualitative* or quantitative* or mixed method* or descriptive* or research*).tw.11947846or/4-51414812073 and 64838limit 7 to yr&#8201;=&#8201;&#8220;2000 -Current&#8221;433\nOVID Medline\n1Speech Recognition Software4162((voice or speech) adj (recogni* or respon*)).tw.20813or/1-222634exp Research/2244875(qualitative* or quantitative* or mixed method* or descriptive* or research*).tw.8408216or/4-597145673 and 63608limit 7 to yr&#8201;=&#8201;&#8220;2000 -Current&#8221;319\nOVID PreMedline\n1((voice or speech) adj (recogni* or respon*)).tw.1402(qualitative* or quantitative* or mixed method* or descriptive* or research*).tw.9451331 and 2204limit 3 to yr&#8201;=&#8201;&#8220;2000 -Current&#8221;19Note that Speech Recognition Software refers to a MeSH term. * = wildcard.\nSelection of studies\nThe search identified 1,730 references to publications that were published in or after 2000. There were 639 duplicates in these 1,730 references which were removed resulting in 1,091. Some 1,073 papers were not found to be relevant as they reflected other topics or applications such as: auditory research (65), cochlear implant or hearing instrument (174), conversations, or multiple speakers (12), discrete speech utterance (2), impaired voice (150), informal research notes including comments or response (6), interactive voice response (199), speech perception (53), synthesized speech (4), thesis (1), and other irrelevant topics (340). The remaining 18 were examined using the inclusion criteria by two independent reviewers and 14 papers (see Figure&#160;1) were retained. All identified abstracts were reviewed by two reviewers, and a third where there was disagreement. The relevant full text of the article was obtained and then if the paper met the eligibility criteria (checked by two reviewers) the study was included. Inclusion criteria were: referred to speech recognition in health care settings, used by health professionals (allied health, medicine, nursing, technical or support staff), with evaluation of patient or staff outcomes.Figure 1\nSelection of studies for the review.\nThe quality of each eligible study was rated by two independent reviewers using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (including a range of quantitative designs the focus in this review) [28]. The scores for the included studies ranged from 4 to 6 out of a possible maximum of 6 [22, 29] (See Table&#160;2). Data were extracted from the relevant papers using a specifically designed data extraction tool and due to the nature of the content reviewed by two reviewers.Table 2\nSR Quality scoring of included studies - Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT)-Version 2011\nAl-Aynati 2003\n[18]Alapetite, 2008\n[30]Alapetite, 2009\n[31]Callaway, 2002\n[20]Derman, 2010\n[32]Devine, 2000\n[33]Irwin, 2007\n[34]Kanal, 2001\n[35]Koivikko, 2008\n[36]Langer, 2002\n[37]Mohr, 2003\n[22]NSLHD 2012\n[29]Singh, 2011\n[23]Zick, 2001\n[38]\nScreening Questions\nClear research questionsYesYesYesYesYesYesYesYesYesYesYesYesYesYesAppropriate data collectedYesYesYesYesYesYesYesYesYesYesYesYesYesYes\n1.

However, one study was carried out in a laboratory setting simulating an operating room [30].The health professionals or support staff involved were: nurses [29], pathologists [23], physicians [22, 29, 31, 32, 38], radiologists [18, 35, 36], secretaries [22], transcriptionists [18, 22] and undergraduate dental students [34]. In one study no participants were identified [30].Training varied between studies with some studies providing data based on minimal training 5&#160;minutes [29] to 30&#160;minutes [23] to 6&#160;hours [22]. One study emphasised the need for one to two months use before staff were familiar with SR [32].The majority of the papers focused on systems that supported English language, however other languages such as Finnish [36] and Danish [30] were also investigated. Participants in two studies were non native English speakers although they transcribed documents into English [18, 35].The quality scores for the studies ranged from two studies at 4 [29, 30], six studies at 5 [18, 32, 34, 35, 37, 38], and six studies at 6 [20, 22, 23, 31, 33, 36], with 6 being the maximum score possible (see Table&#160;2).\nOutcomes of the studies\nThe main outcome measures in the included studies were: productivity including report turnaround time [20, 22, 23, 29, 36&#8211;38]; and accuracy [18, 22, 29, 38].The findings of the included studies were heterogeneous in nature, with diverse outcome measures, which resulted in a narrative presentation of the studies (See Table&#160;3).Table 3\nSummary of speech recognition (SR) review results\nAuthorAimSettingOutcome measuresResultsYearSampleCountry DesignSpeech technology (ST)DesignAl-Aynati and Chorneyko 2003 [18]To compare SR software with HT for generating pathology reports\nSetting: Surgical pathology1.

Overall, most papers [22, 29, 36&#8211;38] reported significant improvement in RTT with SR. Two studies reported a significant reduction of RTT when SR was used to generate patient notes in an emergency department (ED) setting [29] and clinical notes in endocrinology [22]. A longitudinal study (20,000 radiology examinations) indicated that using SR reduced RTTs by 81% with reports available within one hour increasing from 26% to 58% [36]. Similarly, the average RTT of surgical pathology reports was reduced from four days to three days with increases in the proportion of reports completed within one day (22% to 36%) [23]. Zick and Olsen reported the reduction in RTT achieved by using SR in ED resulted in annual savings of approximately $334,000 [38].Results of another study reported significant differences in RTT between SR systems produced by different companies. The authors reported that Dragon software took the shortest time (12.2 mins) to dictate a 938-word discharge report followed by IBM and L & H [33].\nQuality of reports\nThe quality of the reports in seven studies was determined by comparing errors or accuracy rates [18, 23, 29, 30, 33, 35, 38]. Taken together results from these studies suggest that human transcription is slightly more accurate than SR. The highest reported average accuracy rate across the included studies was 99.6% for human transcription [18] compared to 98.5% for SR [38]. However, an ED study found that reports generated by SR did not have grammatical errors while typed reports contained spelling and punctuation mistakes [29].Evidence from the included studies also suggests that error rates are dependent on the type of SR system. A comparison of three SR systems indicated that IBM ViaVoice 98 General Medical Vocabulary had the lowest overall error rates compared with Dragon Naturally Speaking Medical Suite and L&H Voice X-press for Medicine, General Medicine Edition, when used for generating medical record entries [33]. A similar comparative analysis of four dental SR applications reported variation with regards to: time required to complete training, error rates, total number of commands required to complete specific tasks, dental specific functionality, and user satisfaction [34].\nSystem design\nSome SR systems incorporated generic templates and dictation macros that included sections for specific assessment information such as chief complaint, history of present illness, past medical history, medications, allergies and physical examination [22, 38]. Other researchers used SR systems with supplementary accessories for managing text information such as generic templates [22], medical or pathology terminology dictionary [18, 20, 33, 38], Radiology Information System (RIS) [37] and Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) [36]. Evidence from these studies suggests that the use of additional applications such as macros and templates can substantially improve turnaround times, accuracy and completeness of documents generated using SR.\nDiscussion\nThe purpose of this review was to provide contemporary evidence on SR systems and their application within health care. From this review and within the limitations of the quality of the studies included, we suggest that an SR system can be successfully implemented in a variety of health care settings with some considerations.Several studies compared the use of transcribers to SR with human transcription having slightly higher overall word accuracy [18, 22, 36, 38] although with increased grammatical errors [29]. SR, although not as accurate (98.5% SR, 99.7% transcription [38]) with 10.3% to 15.2% error rates [33, 35], does deliver other benefits. Significantly improved patient outcomes such as reduced turnaround times for reporting [20, 23, 36&#8211;38] and cost-effectiveness [20, 38] have been demonstrated, however, equivocal evidence exists on improved workflow processes with Derman and colleagues finding no significant improvement [32].Several issues related to the practical implementation of SR systems have been identified.As with any information system [39], a SR system represents the interplay of staff, system, environment, and processes. A diverse range of health professionals and support staff were included in these studies with no demonstrable differences in training or accuracy, however typists (including health professionals) who are competent and presumably fast typists have some difficulty adapting to SR systems [22] ie., more benefit is obtained for slower typists. Also the length of transcription does seem to raise some concerns with text of 3&#160;minutes or less recording time being problematic [22]. The nature of the information to be transcribed is also important as repetitive clinical cases frequently seen in settings such as radiology [36] or the emergency department [29], where templates or macros are easily adapted to the setting, are more likely to succeed. Applications relating to the writing of progress notes within psychiatry were limited in their success suggesting that other approaches or advances may be required where opportunities for standardised information is reduced [40].In the majority of the included studies the reported error rates and improvements and other outcomes were achieved after only limited training was provided to participants who had no prior experience with SR. Training delivered varied from 5&#160;minutes [29] to 6&#160;hours [22], but several researchers advised that either a pre-training period using any speech recognition system [22] for one month or prolonged exposure with SR (one to three months) [20] is preferred. This is confirmed by the improved turnaround times demonstrated in longitudinal studies [36].Technical aspects of system selection, vocabulary applied, and the management of background noise and accented voices are all challenges during implementation. System selection is important with several systems available with varying levels of recognition errors (7.0%-9.1% IBM ViaVoice98 General Medicine Vocabulary to 14.1%-15.2%&#160;L&H Voice Xpress for Medicine General medicine Edition) [33], but with nonetheless relatively low error rates. Dawson and colleagues [41] noted that nurses expectations of the accuracy of speech recognition systems were low.Accuracy also varies depending upon the vocabulary used with potential users needing to consider the appropriate vocabulary for the task&#8212; using a pathology vocabulary [18], and using a general medicine vocabulary [33]&#8212;to minimise recognition errors. For example laboratory studies varying vocabularies for nursing handover confirmed that using the nursing vocabulary was more accurate than using the general medical vocabulary in the Dragon Medical version 11.0 (72.5% vs. 57.1%) [42].Most contemporary SR systems have advanced microphones that have noise cancelling capacities that allow for SR systems to be used in noisy clinical environments [18, 30].SR systems now accommodate some accented voices such as Dragon Medical&#8482; providing accented voice profiles, for Australian English, Indian English and South East Asian English [40]. Finally the use of standardised terminology is recommended such as the Voice Recognition Accuracy standards- by the National Institutes of Standards and Technology\n[22] when reporting study outcomes.\nLimitations of the study\nWhereas every endeavour was made to optimise inclusivity, the heterogeneity of the studies made comparative analysis and synthesis of the data challenging. The studies included in this review represent comparative designs or descriptive evaluations and only further rigorous clinical trials can confirm or refute the findings proposed here. A thorough examination of the cost benefits of SR in specific clinical settings needs to be undertaken to confirm some of the economic outcomes proposed or demonstrated here. The focus on patient turnaround times in reporting of radiographic procedures or assessment within the emergency department has the potential to increase patient flow and reduce waiting times. Additionally, SR has the potential to automatically generate standardised, terminology-coded clinical records and dynamically interact with clinical information systems to enhance clinical decision-making and improve time-to-diagnosis. Taking into account these areas in future evaluations will allow for a more comprehensive assessment of the overall impact that SR systems can have on quality of care and patient safety, as well as efficiency of clinical practice. We acknowledge the importance of publication bias relating to non-publication of studies or selective reporting of results that may affect the findings of this review.\nConclusions\nSR systems have substantial benefits but these benefits need to be considered in light of the cost of the SR system, training requirements, length of transcription task, potential use of macros and templates, and the presence of accented voices. The regularity of use enhances accuracy although frustration can result in disengaging with the technology before large accuracy gains are made. Expectations prior to implementation combined with the need for prolonged engagement with the technology are issues for management during the implementation phase. The improved turnaround times of patient diagnostic procedure reports or similar tasks represent an important outcome as it impacts on timely delivery of quality patient care. The ubiquitous nature of SR systems within other social contexts will guarantee improvements in SR systems (software and hardware). The availability of applications such as macros, templates, and medical dictionaries will increase accuracy and improve user acceptance. These advances will ultimately increase the uptake of SR systems by diverse health and support staff working within a range of healthcare settings.\nAuthors\u2019 information\nMJ Faculty of Health Sciences Australian Catholic University, previously University of Western Sydney and Director, Centre for Applied Nursing Research (a joint facility of the South Western Sydney Local Health District and the University of Western Sydney), Sydney Australia.

The primers were trimmed and only 21- to 24-nt long sRNAs were filtered after quality check of the raw data. The filtered sRNA population was then mapped against both the genomic (+) and antigenomic (&#8722;) strands of the respective PSTVd variants using standard pattern-matching algorithm. The profiling of viroid derived sRNA (vd-sRNA) revealed that the viroids are susceptible to host RNA silencing mechanism. High-throughput sequence data linked to this project have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database under accession number GSE69225.", "body": "Direct link to deposited data\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE69225.\nExperimental design, materials and methods\nViroids are the non-coding, single stranded, circular RNAs molecules with sizes range of 246 to 401 nucleotides (nt). They can infect certain plants. Recent findings, however, show that viroid infection is associated with the appearance of viroid-derived small RNA (vd-sRNA). These vd-sRNAs have sizes similar to endogenous small interfering RNA and microRNA (miRNA) indicating the possibility of connection of vd-sRNA to the induced symptoms. Interestingly the symptoms vary dramatically, depending on both the plant cultivar and the viroid strain [1].In order to verify the production of small RNA (sRNA) by the PSTVd variants: PSTVd-mild (PSTVd-M, synonym PSTVd-Dah; GenBank Acc. No. AB623143) and PSTVd-intermediate (PSTVd-I; GenBankAcce. No. AY937179) upon infection, the tomato plants were inoculated with the respective viroid variants as described previously [2]. Mock inoculated plants were used as control. At 21-days postinoculation (dpi) leaf samples were collected and subjected to total RNA extraction using the mirVana&#8482; miRNA isolation kit (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA), with slight modifications. Briefly, 3 to 4 leaf discs were homogenized with 400&#160;&#956;L of lysis/binding buffer. Then, 60&#160;&#956;L of miRNA homogenate additive was added. The resulting solution was purified using acid phenol:chloroform (5:1) followed by DNase I (Promega, Madison, USA) treatment. The RNA was precipitated by adding 2.5&#160;vol of absolute alcohol. RNA integrity was examined in a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, California, USA). The total RNA obtained was subjected for northern blot analysis in order to confirm the accumulation of PSTVd-specific sRNA as described previously [2]. By referring to the RNA size marker, a gel slice containing the sRNAs of 15 to 50 nucleotides were excised and eluted from gel using 1&#160;mL gel elution buffer (0.5&#160;M ammonium acetate, 1&#160;mM EDTA [pH&#160;8.0], 0.1% (w/v) SDS) as described previously [3]. All the recovered sRNAs were sent to Hokkaido System Science Co. (Sapporo, Japan) for deep-sequencing using a Genetic Analyzer IIx platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA).The samples were quantified in an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and were processed simultaneously in the Illumina system using an index-sequence. The adapter sequences were trimmed from the ends of the resulting raw data. Filtered sequences where re-grouped after eliminating the sequence reads less that 21&#160;nt and longer that 24&#160;nt [3]. Approximately 4.3 million reads of sRNA were obtained from the leaf samples of mock inoculated (GSM1695655), PSTVd-M (GSM1695656) and PSTVd-I (GSM1695657) inoculated plants.Sequence analysis of over 4.28 million sRNAs obtained from mock inoculated plants identified about 108 and 106 viroid specific small RNAs (vd-sRNA) of PSTVd-M and PSTVd-I type, respectively, matching the genomes of PSTVd-M and PSTVd-I. Analysis of 4.54 million sRNA reads obtained from the PSTVd-M inoculated plants against both the (+) and (&#8722;) strands of PSTVd-M revealed 103,933 vd-sRNAs. Similarly, analysis of 4.88 million reads obtained from the PSTVd-I inoculated plants against both the (+) and (&#8722;) strands of PSTVd-I underscored 488,146 vd-sRNAs. That said, PSTVd-I inoculated plants showed more vd-sRNA (11.3%) than PSTVd-M (2.3%) inoculated plants. This difference in the vd-sRNA recovery can be attributed to the lower accumulation of PSTVd-M compared to PSTVd-I, as described previously [2]. All 21- to 24-nt long vd-sRNAs were profiled on both polarity strands of the respective PSTVd variants using the standard pattern-matching algorithm in order to understand the production of the vd-sRNAs (Fig. 1). Although PSTVd-M and PSTVd-I produced different amount of sRNAs, both showed similar vd-sRNA profile. Further, profiling of vd-sRNA on the PSTVd genome revealed that certain region of PSTVd produced more sRNA than others, indicating that these regions are more susceptible to RNA silencing.", "pmid": "26697336", "title": "Analysis of small RNA production patterns among the two potato spindle tuber viroid variants in tomato plants", "journal_title": "Genomics Data", "authors": "Charith Raj Adkar-Purushothama;Jean-Pierre Perreault;Teruo Sano", "doi": "10.1016/j.gdata.2015.08.008", "score": "0.007529567"}, {"keywords": "atherosclerosis;dyslipidemia;genetic association study;HDL cholesterol;kidney;Mendelian randomization analysis", "abstract": "Supplemental Digital Content is available in the text.", "body": "Materials and Methods\nMaterials and Methods are available in the online-only Data Supplement. In brief, we selected genetic variants that were found to be associated with HDL cholesterol on a genome-wide significant level (P188&#8201;000 subjects.23 We decided not to include SNPs that were found to be genome-wide significant exclusively with other lipid phenotypes than HDL cholesterol. With this approach, weak instrument bias can be held as small as possible. These SNPs were looked up in publicly available GWAS summary statistics from the CKDGen Consortium for the association with kidney function parameters including &#8804;133&#8201;413 subjects.24 Over-representation of P values <0.05 was tested using a binomial test. The significance level of the single SNP look-up was set to 0.05/68=7.35&#215;10&#8722;4 after Bonferroni correction on the number of SNPs. In addition, a Mendelian randomization analysis was performed using the published summarized data as described in the study by Burgess et al.25 A schematic overview of the study design, main findings, and interpretation is provided in Figure I in the online-only Data Supplement.\nResults\n\nSingle SNP Associations\nResults for all 68 individual and independent SNPs that were reported to be associated with HDL cholesterol concentrations23 are shown in Table I in the online-only Data Supplement. For each associated locus, the lead SNP was selected in the first place irrespective of possible associations with other lipid phenotypes. Under the assumption that there is no association of HDL cholesterol&#8211;associated SNPs with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), a uniform distribution of P values would be expected. Figure 1 shows the observed distribution of the P values for the association analysis between the HDL cholesterol&#8211;associated SNPs and eGFR. There was a considerable excess of low P values: 14 of 68 SNPs (21%) had a P value <0.05, compared with the 5%, which would have been expected (Binomial test P=5.8&#215;10&#8722;6). Of these, 6 SNPs still passed a significance level corrected for the number of evaluated SNPs (Bonferroni correction, 0.05/68=7.35&#215;10&#8722;4; Table 1). Two of these even reached genome-wide significance for eGFR (rs11869286 and rs11613352). Interestingly, the genetic variants with the strongest associations with HDL cholesterol concentrations were not the same as those with the strongest association with kidney function and vice versa. A side-by-side comparison of the SNP effect estimates on HDL cholesterol and eGFR can be found in Table I in the online-only Data Supplement and is shown in Figures 2 and 3. The effects on HDL cholesterol of the 6 SNPs, which we detected to be associated with both HDL cholesterol and eGFR, were rather modest. They were the 8th, 21st, 32nd, 39th, 41st, and 53rd SNP among the HDL cholesterol&#8211;associated SNPs in Global Lipids Genetics Consortium on the &#946;-estimate on HDL cholesterol. Conversely, CETP, which showed the largest &#946; on HDL cholesterol in the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium (rs3764261; &#946;= 0.241; P=1&#215;10&#8722;769), was not significantly associated with eGFR. Notably, 6 SNPs (mapping in or near the genes TRIB1, STARD3, and ARL15) were not consistent with the direction of effects, which would have been expected from the results of Bowe et al10 in the sense that SNPs lowering HDL cholesterol were not associated with lower eGFR.Twenty-eight of the 68 HDL cholesterol&#8211;associated SNPs (41%) were found to have genome-wide significant associations with other phenotypes besides HDL cholesterol according to the GWAS catalog (Table I in the online-only Data Supplement), primarily with triglyceride levels indicating potential pleiotropy.\nMendelian Randomization Analysis\nTo estimate the effect of genetically increased HDL cholesterol values on eGFR, single SNP effects were combined using a meta-analysis approach. Because only summarized data are present, the F statistic and the coefficient of determination (R2)&#8212;which are measures of the strength of the instrumental variables (IV)&#8212;cannot be determined empirically using this data. However, only genome-wide significant SNPs that are independent of each other (pairwise linkage disequilibrium between all SNPs: r2<0.1) were included in this analysis (P30 for each variant.25 In the Mendelian randomization literature, a threshold of F<10 has typically been used to define a weak IV (the Staiger&#8211;Stock rule.26,27) It has been reported that SNPs identified in GWAS on HDL cholesterol roughly explain 13% of the phenotypic variance.23,28 Calculating the proportion of explained variance for the 68 used SNPs in our analysis based on the reported &#946; estimates yielded an estimate of 6.6%. Even for this lower conservative estimate, weak instrument bias can be assumed to be low.25 Using the adapted MR-Egger regression, no directional bias could be detected (MR-Egger intercept=0.0003; 95% confidence interval [CI]=&#8722;0.0005 to 0.0010; P=0.4872; Table 2). Nevertheless, when including all 68 SNPs, high heterogeneity was detected, necessitating the use of a random effects model.Figure 2 shows all single SNP effect estimates on both the HDL cholesterol concentrations and eGFR. The straight black line displays the combined Mendelian randomization estimate. There was a small positive effect, which means that eGFR was higher for genetically increased HDL cholesterol values. However, this effect was not significant (2-sample &#946;Mendelian randomization&#8722;inverse-variance weighted [MR-IVW]=0.0089; 95% CI=&#8722;0.0023 to 0.0201; P=0.1209; Pheterogeneity<10&#8722;16) even when we corrected for overlapping samples in the GWAS of HDL cholesterol and eGFR (&#946;MR-IVW_corr=0.0083 95% CI=&#8722;0.0022 to 0.0187; P=0.1206; Pheterogeneity<10&#8722;16). Also, the causal estimate obtained from the MR-Egger regression showed no effect (&#946;MR-Egger=0.0012; 95% CI=&#8722;0.0132 to 0.0156; P=0.8709; Figure II in the online-only Data Supplement). Likewise, the weighted median estimate approach resulted in a nonsignificant causal estimate of &#946;WME=0.0046(95% CI=&#8722;0.0027 to 0.0119; P=0.2316). Taken together, these results argue against a causal effect of HDL cholesterol on eGFR (Table 2).To further examine the heterogeneity and possible pleiotropic effects, we conducted a goodness-of-fit test. This resulted in 11 SNPs that could be detected to influence eGFR through additional pathways not involving HDL cholesterol concentrations. These SNPs included all 6 SNPs, which were significantly associated with eGFR in the single SNP analysis (TRIB1, STARD3, SLC39A8, R3HDM2, LACTB, and ARL15). Removing these 11 SNPs also removed heterogeneity. The subsequently performed fixed-effects inverse variance model yielded a positive, but nonsignificant effect (&#946;MR-IVW=0.0047; 95% CI=&#8722;0.0003 to 0.0096; P=0.0649; Pheterogeneity=0.0556; Figure 3). Removing potential pleiotropic effects according to a search in the GWAS catalog led to the exclusion of 28 SNPs and to a similar effect estimate (2-sample &#946;MR-IVW=0.0129; 95% CI=&#8722;0.0048 to 0.0305; P=0.1526; Pheterogeneity=3.75&#215;10&#8722;9; Figure III in the online-only Data Supplement). Finally, adjusting for the effect estimates of HDL cholesterol SNPs on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides resulted in an estimate of the causal effect of &#946;jointlinear model=0.0046 (95% CI=&#8722;0.0113 to 0.0205; P=0.4437). An overview of all estimates calculated in the different sets of SNPs is given in Table 2.\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we followed up a recently published association of HDL cholesterol levels and eGFR by investigating whether genetic variants that show genome-wide significant associations with HDL cholesterol concentrations are also associated with kidney function. For this purpose, we (1) assessed whether HDL cholesterol&#8211;associated SNPs are enriched for SNPs associated with kidney function and (2) used a Mendelian randomization analysis to assess whether the observational association between higher HDL cholesterol and better kidney function may be causal.We observed a higher fraction of HDL cholesterol&#8211;associated variants to be also associated with eGFR than expected by chance. After Bonferroni correction, 6 SNPs were significantly associated with eGFR. Two of them were genome-wide significant, mapping to 2 previously found regions for kidney function.24,29 Interestingly, the genetic variants with the strongest associations with HDL cholesterol concentrations were not the same as those with the strongest association with kidney function and vice versa.Second, the Mendelian randomization resulted in a positive but not significant causal effect. This indicates that eGFR is not significantly higher in people with genetically increased HDL cholesterol concentrations. Using the MR-Egger regression, no directional pleiotropy could be detected. Nevertheless, unbalanced pleiotropy cannot be ruled out using this method. The more consistent causal estimate in case of pleiotropy obtained from the slope of the MR-Egger regression strengthened the finding that HDL cholesterol does not causally influence eGFR.Removing potentially pleiotropic SNPs identified by the GWAS catalog increased variability of the estimated effect resulting in a wider confidence interval of the causal effect, because most of the SNPs with high effects on HDL cholesterol are also associated with other phenotypes (primarily with triglyceride levels). However, as explained in Figure 4, pleiotropic effects only represent a problem for a Mendelian randomization analysis if a SNP impacts eGFR also independently from HDL cholesterol, or in other words, in case that the effect on eGFR is not entirely mediated by HDL cholesterol. Removing the SNPs identified to be pleiotropic by the goodness-of-fit test attenuated the effect estimate but also reduced variability, yielding a positive but still not statistically significant effect. Even if the effect was significant, a causal effect of such small magnitude would not explain the observed epidemiological association of HDL cholesterol on kidney function.10 The effect estimate derived from this method is similar in magnitude with the estimates obtained from weighted median method and for the regression adjusting for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides. Therefore, all performed methods that allow and/or adjust for potential pleiotropy come to the conclusion that HDL cholesterol does not causally influence eGFR.In light of the Mendelian randomization data, the observed over-representation of eGFR-associated SNPs among the HDL-associated SNPs, which we observed in our first analysis, has to be critically evaluated. Besides an impact of confounding through triglyceride concentrations, the associations might reflect regulators of HDL function and maturation rather than mere HDL cholesterol concentration. Keeping that in mind, it might not be contradicting that 3 of the significant SNPs in ARL15, TRIB1, and STARD3 do not match the expected effect direction, which is eGFR increasing for HDL cholesterol&#8211;increasing alleles. The observed association with eGFR might not follow the same pathway as the association with HDL cholesterol, indicating the possibility of pleiotropic effects. Unfortunately, little is known about the function of the significant genes in HDL and kidney metabolism (Note I in the online-only Data Supplement).One limitation of our study is that no individual-level data but only summarized data based on published GWAS studies were available for analysis. Therefore, the strength of the used instruments and the power of the Mendelian randomization analysis cannot be measured directly. Hence, a possible bias caused by weak instruments cannot be estimated. Assuming a 2-sample setting, using weak instruments would lead to an estimate of the causal effect that is biased toward the null hypothesis of no effect.30,31 In a one-sample setting, weak instruments would lead to an estimate of the causal effect that is biased toward the observational effect estimate. Because we have &#8776;43% overlap between both samples, we would assume a possible bias between a null and observed effect. We, therefore, included a correction for the sample overlap. Furthermore, because all SNPs are genome-wide significantly associated with HDL cholesterol, the probability for weak instruments is low. Using summarized data does not only have disadvantages. As shown by Burgess et al,25 Mendelian randomization estimates derived from summarized data are similarly efficient as estimates derived from individual-level data. Using summarized data including huge sample sizes increases power in a way that would not be possible by using individual-level data only, given restrictions with sharing individual-level data. Additionally, using large sample sizes increases precision of the estimates.Was our study limited by power? If we assume that there is a causal relationship between HDL cholesterol and eGFR and that the real causal effect is higher than one third of the observed effect, one would expect that we would have found it (for details, see Note II in the online-only Data Supplement).Another limitation of our analysis is that our applied Mendelian randomization approach assumes a linear relationship of the intermediate phenotype (HDL cholesterol) on the outcome (eGFR). Bowe et al10 showed such a linear relationship for the cross-sectional part of their study. However, the analysis on incident CKD and disease progression, adjusted for baseline eGFR values, showed a U-form, but still with the highest risk for low HDL cholesterol values. If there was a nonlinear causal effect of HDL cholesterol on eGFR, we would not have found it with the Mendelian randomization approach based on published summarized data. The published GWAS results for eGFR are based on cross-sectional studies, which are primarily population based. Therefore, we are not able to evaluate a causal effect of the SNPs on kidney disease progression.In conclusion, our findings do not confirm a causal effect of HDL cholesterol on kidney function, although we observed a significant over-representation of low eGFR-associated P values for HDL cholesterol SNPs. If there was indeed an association of these individual HDL cholesterol&#8211;associated SNPs with eGFR, it might be explained by other culprits than the cholesterol content of the HDL particle.\nSources of Funding\nThis work was supported by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF) (Project P 26660-B13) to C.

Physical activity is considered to be one of the few ways to influence the level of frailty. Standardized exercise programs do not necessarily lead to more physical activity in daily life, however, and a more personalized approach seems appropriate. The main objective of this study is to investigate whether a focused, problem-oriented coaching intervention (&#8216;Coach2Move&#8217;) delivered by a physiotherapist specializing in geriatrics is more effective for improving physical activity, mobility and health status in community-dwelling older adults than usual physiotherapy care. In addition, cost-effectiveness will be determined.Methods/Design\nThe design of this study is a single-blind randomized controlled trial in thirteen physiotherapy practices. Randomization will take place at the individual patient level. The study population consists of older adults, &#8805;70 years of age, with decreased physical functioning and mobility and/or a physically inactive lifestyle. The intervention group will receive geriatric physiotherapy according to the Coach2Move strategy. The control group will receive the usual physiotherapy care. Measurements will be performed by research assistants not aware of group assignment. The results will be evaluated on the amount of physical activity (LASA Physical Activity Questionnaire), mobility (modified &#8216;get up and go&#8217; test, walking speed and six-minute walking test), quality of life (SF-36), degree of frailty (Evaluative Frailty Index for Physical Activity), fatigue (NRS-fatigue), perceived effect (Global Perceived Effect and Patient Specific Complaints questionnaire) and health care costs.Discussion\nMost studies on the effect of exercise or physical activity consist of standardized programs. In this study, a personalized approach is evaluated within a group of frail older adults, many of whom suffer from multiple and complex diseases and problems. A complicating factor in evaluating a new approach is that it may not be automatically adopted by clinicians. Specific actions are undertaken to optimize implementation of the Coach2Move strategy during the trial. Whether or not these will be sufficient is a matter we will consider subsequently, using quality indicators and process analysis.Trial Registration\nThe Netherlands National Trial Register: NTR3527.", "body": "Background\nPhysical activity is considered one of the few ways to influence frailty in older adults [1-4]. The extent to which the level of frailty can be influenced by physical activity remains unclear, however. Frailty is defined as a complex state of increased vulnerability to adverse health outcomes [5]. The causes as well as the consequences of frailty are diverse and originate from multiple dimensions (physical, psychological and social), which makes frailty a difficult concept to measure [6]. A small number of studies have shown a positive effect of physical activity on the level of frailty by measuring physical aspects of frailty [7,8]. The positive effect of exercise on other frailty-related aspects of health, for example, mood and cognition, has also been confirmed in studies [9,10]. The complex interaction between the physical, psychological and social dimensions of frailty influences the level of frailty. The total level of frailty is, therefore, not equivalent to the sum of its components. When, for example, muscle strength improves because of an exercise intervention, this could lead to better mobility and the ability to become more physically active. Also, it may become easier to go outdoors, which can positively influence mood and social interaction. As a consequence, when all these dimensions are taken into account, the level of frailty may improve by even more than the levels of the separate components. The multidimensional level of frailty, considering all aspects of frailty in interaction using one measurement instrument, has not been evaluated in intervention studies on exercise and physical activity hitherto.Furthermore, while the positive effect of physical activity on different aspects of health is widely accepted, many older adults remain sedentary [11]. Standardized supervised exercise interventions do not necessarily increase the level of physical activity in daily life [12]. It is a great challenge to attain the behavioral change that is necessary to become more physically active in the long term and to improve adherence to physical activity programs or interventions. Individually adapted programs that aim for participants to become more physically active in daily life are probably more (cost-) effective [13]. We have developed an individual intervention aimed at promoting physical activity in the broad population of older adults suffering from or at risk of mobility problems. Most older adults have to deal with multiple and complex problems and diseases, and yet often they do not fulfil the specific inclusion criteria used in clinical studies. Therefore, we developed an intervention aimed at a very broad population of older adults. Because of the complexity of this intervention, the Medical Research Council (MRC) framework was used as a guide in developing the intervention. The MRC framework consists of five successive phases: preclinical or theoretical phase (phase I), modelling phase (phase II), exploratory trial (phase III), randomized controlled trial (phase IV), and long-term implementation (phase V). In the theoretical phase, we performed two systematic reviews. The first review deals with instruments for measurement of frailty. In this review, we concluded that numerous measurement instruments exist, but none of them has been developed as an outcome measure [6]. Therefore, we subsequently developed an outcome instrument on frailty; the Evaluative Frailty Index for Physical Activity (EFIP) [14]. In a second article, we review the literature on the effect of physical exercise therapy in older adults who have problems with physical functioning and/or have to deal with co-morbidity [12]. The included literature was evaluated in meta-analyses and we concluded that mobility and physical functioning are positively influenced by physical exercise therapy. Strength training also seemed to be of great importance and a personalized approach may result in long-term positive effects (>12 months). No positive effects on quality of life and the level of physical activity could be found, which confirms that an exercise intervention does not necessarily bring about changes in level of physical activity.In the modelling phase of the MRC framework, we developed the intervention based on the findings from the theoretical phase and expert consultation. This process will be described in detail in another publication. The intervention was called &#8216;Coach2Move&#8217; and is based on clinical reasoning conforming with the Hypothesis Oriented Algorithm for Clinicians (HOAC)-II [15,16] and the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) [17]. The HOAC-II is an algorithm for clinical reasoning that describes all steps to be taken in order to make appropriate decisions about the treatment of patients. The steps of the HOAC-II were specified for the physiotherapy treatment of frail older adults with mobility problems in the Coach2Move strategy. The core elements of the Coach2Move strategy are: 1) increasing the level of physical activity and (social) participation; 2) patient-identified goals, and thereby improving adherence; 3) enablement instead of disablement (what a patient can do instead of what a patient cannot do); and 4) self-management. The Coach2Move strategy was tested for feasibility and efficacy in a pilot study (NM De Vries et al., unpublished observations). The results of this pilot study showed that the Coach2Move strategy is well appreciated by both physiotherapists and patients and that a positive effect on physical activity, mobility, frailty and quality of life can be expected. The present article describes the study design of a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) to evaluate the Coach2Move strategy. The main objective of this RCT is to test the hypothesis that the Coach2Move strategy delivered by a physiotherapist specializing in geriatrics is more effective in improving physical activity in community-dwelling older adults than is usual physiotherapy care. As a secondary objective, the effect of the Coach2Move strategy on the (multidimensional) level of frailty, mobility and quality of life, as well as cost-effectiveness, will be assessed in comparison with usual physiotherapy.\nMethods/Design\n\nStudy design\nThe study design is a single-blinded randomized controlled trial (RCT) in which the consort guidelines are being followed. The RCT is being performed in thirteen physiotherapy practices. In each participating practice both a general physiotherapist (PT) and a PT specializing in geriatrics (GPT) will participate in the study. Participating GPTs will be trained in the Coach2Move strategy. The PTs will provide the usual care.\nParticipants\nThe population consists of (pre-)frail older adults with mobility problems and/or a physically inactive lifestyle who are at risk of loss of mobility in the near future. This study focuses on elderly people living relatively independently at home or in a home for elderly people. Older adults with acute health problems for which hospital admission or admission to a nursing home is necessary are excluded. Older adults signed up for physiotherapy are considered for inclusion, whether referred by a physician or having decided to attend physiotherapy by themselves.The inclusion criteria are as follows:1. Older adults aged&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;70 years living independently at home or in an older persons&#8217; home.2. A mobility problem and/or a physically inactive lifestyle (< 30 minutes per day) rated as such by the participant, their relatives or the referring physician.The exclusion criteria are as follows:1. Unable to walk 5 meters (waling aid allowed).2. Unable to follow verbal or written instructions, operationalized by a minimum score of 21 points on the Minimal Mental State Examination (MMSE), or unable to understand Dutch.3. Palliative phase of illness.4. Acute illness with hospital indication.5. Severe degenerative neurological illness.6. Having a contraindication for being physically active.7. Having had physiotherapy for a period longer than four weeks during the last six months.\nRandomization, blinding and treatment allocation\nAll older adults (&#8805;70 years old) who sign up for physiotherapy in one of the participating physiotherapy practices, because of mobility problems and/or physical inactivity are asked to participate in the trial by either a physiotherapist or a practice secretary. If willing to participate, they are called by a member of the research team within two days. The member of the research team will determine potential eligibility by telephone and make an appointment for baseline measurement. An informed consent form is signed by both the participant and the research assistant before the baseline measurement. The final decision on inclusion or exclusion and randomization takes place after baseline measurement. Randomization is done on the individual level through a computer-generated random-sequence table. Pre-stratification is applied by physiotherapy practice. Opaque, sequentially numbered, sealed envelopes are prepared for each stratum (that is, physiotherapy practice) by a researcher who is not involved in enrolling the participants, in assigning them to their groups or performing follow-up measurements. Each of the envelopes contains a sheet of paper indicating one of the two interventions. The sealed envelopes are delivered to the participating physiotherapists or practice secretaries after baseline measurement. Participants learn their group assignments after the researcher or research assistant involved in the baseline measurement has left. Follow-up measurement at three and six months is performed by two research assistants who are unaware of group allocation.\nInformed consent and ethical approval\nAll eligible patients are informed about this study and given the time they needed to consider participation. The investigator of this study and an independent physician not involved in the study may be approached for questions. Patients who are willing to participate sign an informed consent form. This study has been approved by the medical ethical review board of the Radboud University Medical Centre, Nijmegen (registration number: 2012/233), and is registered in The Netherlands National Trial Register (registration number: NTR3527).\nIntervention\nThe intervention consists of geriatric physiotherapy according to the Coach2Move strategy ([see Additional file 1 and Table&#160;1]). The Coach2Move strategy helps the GPT in clinical reasoning by providing an extensive, pre-structured and systematically organized diagnostic protocol. For the diagnostic phase of the Coach2Move strategy more time (1.5 hours) is available than for the conventional physiotherapy intake (30 minutes). Impairments and disabilities, but also possibilities, wishes, barriers and facilitators relevant to physical functioning are thoroughly examined. Motivational interviewing is used to find and deal with the barriers to individuals becoming physically active, but also to find out what personal goals a patient wants to achieve. Physiotherapy treatment in the Coach2Move strategy is focused on increasing motivation to be physically active by working on personal goals and removing physical barriers. Using shared decision making together with the patient, the GPT sets SMART goals &#8211; specific, measurable, acceptable, realistic and (with a) timeline. The GPT coaches the patient in reaching and maintaining his/her own goals (self-management) using appropriate feedback.In Coach2Move, three intervention profiles with a predefined number of sessions can be chosen. Patients are categorized into one of these three profiles based on the complexity of their problems and their potential for improvement. The first profile deals with patients who do not need physiotherapy intervention on the level of body function or structure, but who just need coaching and advice (&#8804;4 sessions). The second profile is aimed at improving functions, abilities and activities over a course of seven to nine sessions for patients who need temporary treatment to overcome barriers to becoming physically active. In the third profile, patients with specific problems in participation, activities and functions are treated and coached in 12 to 18 sessions.GPTs are trained in the Coach2Move strategy in a basic training of two days. This training focuses on:&#8211;1. Clinical reasoning.2. Using appropriate measurement instruments in the diagnostic phase but also in the evaluation of the intervention and as feedback instrument for the patient and therapist.3. Shared decision making.4. SMART focused goals (specific, measurable, acceptable, realistic, timeline).5. Learning to focus on coaching and self-management.6. Learning to work in a patient-centered way and using measurements for feedback.7. Learning motivational interviewing skills.8. Learning skills for adequate coordination with other formal and informal caregivers involved.In this study, the control intervention consists of conventional physiotherapy provided by a PT. A one-day basic training is organized for the PTs to enhance their motivation to participate in this RCT. The training consists of general information regarding the treatment of older adults. In this training, no attention is paid to clinical reasoning, measurement instruments, shared decision making, motivational interviewing or self-management.The treatment delivered by both the GPTs and the PTs consists of conventional physiotherapy modalities such as training activities in daily living, balance and muscle strength. No standardized intervention is prescribed and in both groups the physiotherapist is free to determine the appropriate intervention and level to reach the intervention goals. We expect less focus on physical activity in the control group. Moreover, the control group can freely decide how many sessions are needed. This is standard procedure in physiotherapy care in the Netherlands.The key elements of the Coach2Move strategy are set out in Table&#160;1 and these are the main distinguishing factors between the intervention and the control group. Even though shared decision making, patient-centered treatment and goal setting on participation level are considered important, physiotherapists have difficulty actually applying this in clinical practice [18-20]. The Coach2Move strategy offers education in these elements and supports physiotherapists during the implementation, which we expect to result in a contrast between the intervention and control groups. Both therapies are expected to be effective; however, we hypothesize that the Coach2Move strategy will be more effective on the level of physical activity and in reaching treatment goals in fewer physiotherapy sessions.\nStudy parameters\nThe main study parameter is the level of physical activity during follow-up over six months. The level of physical activity will be measured using the LASA Physical Activity Questionnaire (LAPAQ) [21]. The LAPAQ is a reliable and valid instrument specifically developed for older adults. The LAPAQ is a comprehensive questionnaire on diverse (physical) activities of daily living including walking, riding a bicycle, gardening, light household chores, heavy household chores and sporting activities. Based on the results of this questionnaire, the average amount of physical activity in minutes per day and minutes per week can be assessed.Secondary study parameters include mobility, quality of life, level of frailty, fatigue and perceived effect. Mobility is measured using the &#8216;get up and go&#8217; test (GUG) [22], the six-minute walking test (6MWT) [23] and walking speed (WS) timed over a 10-meter distance [24]. During the modified GUG, the patient is instructed to rise out of a chair and walk 10 meters [24]. This procedure is timed and the duration in seconds is the score for this test. The effort of completing the same test is measured using the BORG scale of perceived exertion [25]. The Borg scale ranges from 6 to 20, where 6 indicates no exertion and 20 the highest possible exertion. The 6MWT consists of six minutes walking at the patients&#8217; self-determined pace. The score on this test is the distance in meters covered in six minutes. WS is timed on a 10-meter distance. The mean time in seconds it takes the patient to walk this distance (at his/her own preferred speed) over three tries, is the final score on this test [24]. The SF-36 is used as a measure of quality of life [26]. The SF-36 is a 36-item questionnaire on health status. Questions relate to eight domains: vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning and mental health. Each domain is equally weighted and a standardized scoring system results in two scores: a physical score and a mental/emotional score. Both scores range from 0 to 100 with an average score of 50, and a higher score indicating a better quality of life.To measure the level of frailty, the Evaluative Frailty Index for Physical activity (EFIP) is used [14]. The EFIP is a 50-item questionnaire based on deficit accumulation (symptoms, signs, disabilities) in multiple domains (physical, psychological, social and general health status). The score on this questionnaire is expressed as the ratio of deficits present to the total number of deficits considered. The score ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 indicating no frailty and 1 indicating maximum frailty.Fatigue is measured using the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS)-fatigue [27], which is a scale from 0 to 10 in which the patient can indicate what level of fatigue is experienced. A score of 0 represents no fatigue at all and a score of 10 represents the most possible fatigue.Perceived effect is measured with the PSC (patient specific complaints) questionnaire and Global Perceived Effect (GPE). The PSC is an instrument in which patients can determine three activities in which they experience the most trouble [28]. For each activity one can judge the level of experienced trouble on a scale from 0 to 10 in which 0 indicates no trouble at all and 10 indicates that the activity cannot be performed. The Global Perceived Effect (GPE) [29] score is used to measure the patient&#8217;s opinion about the effect of the intervention on a nine-point scale ranging from very much improvement to very much deterioration.Co-morbidity is registered using the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale-Geriatrics (CIRS-G) [30]. The CIRS-G in combination with registration of the physiotherapy intervention during each session and registration of health care utilization will be used to explore whether a physiotherapy intervention is adjusted because of the presence of co-morbidity, if the presence of co-morbidity influences the effect of an intervention, and if co-morbidity brings about interventions other than physiotherapy.Health care utilization is registered by means of a questionnaire. The questionnaire considers the type and number of medical consultations, medication use, hospital stay, nursing home stay, use of residential facilities, professional home care and the purchase of assistive devices in the three months before the questionnaire is taken.All these measurements are performed at baseline, at three months and at six months by research assistants who are blind regarding the group allocation of individual patients. At the final measurement, patients will also be asked about their adherence during the physiotherapy process by means of a short questionnaire.An influencing variable is the quality of the Coach2Move strategy as delivered by the participating GPTs. Therefore, we will provide the GPTs with an electronic patient file in which the clinical reasoning process is supported. An independent researcher, not involved in follow-up measurement (NV), will have access to the patient files of all participating GPTs and check the records for consistency with the Coach2Move strategy. If the Coach2Move strategy is not being sufficiently followed, the GPT concerned will be coached by the independent researcher in the implementation of the strategy for that specific patient. We are also developing quality indicators to research fidelity to the actual Coach2Move strategy by the participating GPTs. PTs register their physiotherapy process in the usual way and are not coached during the intervention. The patient files of the PTs will be scored with the quality indicators at the end of the trial to determine the amount of contrast between the GPT and PT groups.\nPatient flow\nFigure&#160;1 describes the patient flow. This RCT has an inclusion period of 15 months and a follow-up of six months. This means that the RCT will be completed in 21 months. Patient recruitment started in September 2012 and will end in November 2013.\nSample size\nTo calculate the sample size, we use the formula for an ANCOVA, derived by Teerenstra et al., which states that the sample size uncorrected for clustering and baseline measurement has to be multiplied by two factors [31]. First, a factor that accounts for the clustering: DE&#8201;=&#8201;(1&#8201;+&#8201;(n-1) *ICC), where n is the average number of patients per therapist and ICC is the intra-cluster correlation of patients within a therapist. Second, a factor that accounts for the adjustment for baseline: (1-r2) with r&#8201;=&#8201;r_c*(n*ICC/DE)&#8201;+&#8201;r_s*((1-ICC)/DE), where r_c is the autocorrelation and r_s is the autocorrelation of patients. The autocorrelation is the correlation between the three-month measurement and baseline measurement.\nNone\nIn our pilot study of ten patients treated by one of two therapists, we found on log scale an increase of 1.21 from baseline and a standard deviation of 1.0 (in the pre-intervention scores). This corresponds to a 3.35 fold increase from baseline scores on the untransformed LAPAQ scale. The control group in our study is comparable to the experimental group in the study performed by Rubenstein et al., which found a 20% increase from baseline (1.2-fold increase) [32]. Thus the intervention is estimated to be 3.35/1.2&#8201;=&#8201;2.8 times as effective as the control treatment. To account for possible overestimation of the effect by the pilot study and possible contamination, we assume that at least 60% of this effect will be retained; that is, the intervention is at least 1.68 times as effective as the control. Then, the effect on log scale is 0.5 (sd&#8201;=&#8201;1.0 as above). The uncorrected sample size to detect this difference with 80% at a significance level of 0.05 is 64 patients per group.\nNone\nFrom our pilot study we estimated a subject-autocorrelation r_s&#8201;=&#8201;0.73; therapist-autocorrelation could not be estimated (too few therapists), but conservatively we set it to be moderate r_c&#8201;=&#8201;0.4. Then r&#8201;=&#8201;0.6 and the correction for baseline adjustment is 1-(0.62)&#8201;=&#8201;0.64.\nNone\nIn our pilot study we found ICC&#8201;=&#8201;0 and, conservatively setting the ICC&#8201;=&#8201;0.05, the correction for clustering is 1&#8201;+&#8201;(n-1)*0.05. Allowing for maximal 20% dropout, the corrected sample size can be calculated with: 64*0.64*(1&#8201;+&#8201;(n-1)*0.05)* 1/(80%). Table&#160;2 gives the sample sizes when a different number of physiotherapy practices are included. If each participating physiotherapist (2 per practice, 13 practices&#8201;=&#8201;26 physiotherapists, 12 physiotherapists per group) were to treat 5 patients, a total number of 130 patients would be included (65 patients per group). This is more than the 62 patients per group necessary according to the power calculation (see Table&#160;1). If each therapist were to treat four patients, however, the power would not be reached. Therefore we will include 65 patients per group (total&#8201;=&#8201;130) in this trial.\nStatistical analysis\nDescriptive statistics will be used to present group characteristics on age, education, marital status, multi-morbidity, level of frailty, number of post-operative patients, therapy adherence and adverse effects. Any asymmetry between the intervention and control group on these variables at baseline will be statistically corrected. The effects of the intervention are analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle. The analysis of the primary and secondary outcome measures employed a linear mixed model to relate the three- and six-month outcomes to the effect of the treatment. Therapist is taken as a random effect in this model to account for the clustering of patients with therapists. Measurement (baseline, 3 months, 6 months) is included as a random effect to account for correlation of measurements over time. Because this analysis uses all three measurements (baseline, 3 and 6 months), it will actually be more powerful than an ANCOVA analysis and the power of the study will be more than 80%.\nEconomic evaluation\nThis study investigates the potential efficiency of the Coach2Move strategy compared with usual physiotherapy care in frail elderly patients attending physiotherapy after referral by a physician or by self-referral. The economic evaluation is based on the general principles of a cost-utility analysis, applying a health care perspective. Primary outcome measures for the economic evaluation are: costs and quality adjusted life years (QALY) (SF-6D, part of SF-36) [26]. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) &#8216;cost per QALY gained&#8217; will be computed and uncertainty surrounding this ICER will be determined using a non-parametric bootstrap method. A cost-effectiveness acceptability curve will be derived that is able to evaluate efficiency by using different thresholds (Willingness To Pay) for a QALY gained. The impact of uncertainty surrounding deterministic parameters on the ICER will be explored using one-way sensitivity analyses on the range of extremes.\nNone\nThe cost analysis measures on patient level, volumes of care (consisting of the production factors: personnel, materials and capacity in a prospective way using therapist scoring sheets (CRFs)). Per arm full cost-prices will be determined using standard unit cost-prices according to the Dutch guidelines for costing research [33]. If for certain procedures standard unit cost-prices are not available, real cost-prices will be determined using activity based costing. This approach applies to the health care production part of the economic evaluation. Medical costs will be estimated using a questionnaire on a three-months recall basis in line with the follow-up pattern of the clinical trial [34,35]. Non-health care costs, like productivity losses, seem irrelevant for this population\nNone\nTo measure the quality of the health status of the patients the SF-36 will be used. The SF-36 is a widely used measure of general health in clinical studies throughout the world. It currently generates eight dimension scores and two summary scores for physical and mental health. The SF-6D [34] provides a means for using the SF-36 in economic evaluation by estimating a preference-based single index measure for health from these data using general population values. The SF-6D allows the analyst to obtain QALYs from the SF-36 for use in cost utility analysis. Utilities will be collected alongside the clinical trial as described earlier in the section &#8216;Design&#8217;. These utilities will be transformed into QALYs using the trapezium method.\nDiscussion\n\nStrengths\nThis is one of the first RCTs to evaluate a systematic, individually-tailored physiotherapy intervention for older adults embedded in clinical practice. In most research, standardized exercise programs are evaluated while in daily clinical practice physiotherapy usually is a tailor-made intervention. We expect a larger effect from a tailored intervention than from a standardized exercise program. In addition, most other studies aim at a specific population of older adults, for example, older adults with diabetes or arthritis, excluding older adults with multiple comorbidity. However, most older adults have to deal with more than one health problem and do not fulfil the inclusion criteria set in most studies on standardized exercise programs. The intervention studied in this RCT is therefore more representative for clinical practice than the interventions in previously performed RCTs.\nWeaknesses\nAlthough we expect a large effect from an individually tailored intervention, researching physiotherapy also brings about some difficulties because of the variety in the intervention. Every physiotherapist deals with patients in his or her own way. Additionally, because we include a very broad population of older adults in this RCT, there will be some variety in the participants. Finally, implementing a new treatment strategy like Coach2Move is a challenging process. A new strategy is not automatically adopted by healthcare professionals even after they have been trained in that strategy. Various determinants either positively or negatively influence the implementation process, for example, the characteristics of the new strategy, characteristics of the adopting person, characteristics of the organization or characteristics of the socio-political context [36]. Also, healthcare professionals are thought to go through four stages in an implementation process. The first is the dissemination stage in which the professional finds/is supplied with the new strategy. The second is the adoption stage in which the professional develops either positive or negative intentions about the intervention. In the subsequent implementation phase, the professional tries the new strategy and finds out what working with the new strategy means. In the fourth and final stage, the continuation stage, the new strategy becomes part of routine practice or it does not [37]. In this RCT on the Coach2Move strategy, we work with GPTs who have volunteered to participate in this trial and who are willing to change their professional behavior. They did not, however, have the opportunity to &#8216;practice&#8217; with the Coach2Move strategy before the trial started. Also, willingness to change on the personal level does not mean that the organization (a physiotherapy practice) fully supports implementation of a new strategy. We have tried to improve adherence to the Coach2Move strategy by developing an electronic patient file that supports the GPT in executing the strategy. In addition, the treatment given to each patient in the intervention group is continuously evaluated by one of the researchers (NV), and the GPTs are coached in working according to the Coach2Move strategy. However, when the RCT has ended we still need to consider whether or not implementation has been sufficient. We will use quality indicators and process analysis to do this.\nEthical approval\nThis study has been approved by the medical ethical review board of the Radboud University Medical Centre (registration number: 2012/233), Nijmegen, the Netherlands.\nTrial status\nEnrollment into the study started on 1 September 2012.

Introduction\nHuman cytomegalovirus (HCMV) has been defined as one of the major infectious agents related to AIDS. HCMV infects large populations in general and causes serious diseases in immunocompromised individuals [1,2,3]. A sequential process of viral events is characterized for CMV infection in permissive host cells [3], including viral entry, immediate-early (IE) and early gene expression, DNA replication, late (L) gene expression, viral packaging and release. Major immediate-early (MIE) gene expression is one of the earliest events during CMV infection. MIE genes are the most abundantly expressed viral genes at the IE stage and give rise to several nuclear phosphoproteins that are critical for the next stage of gene expression and viral replication [4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14]. Hence, the HCMV MIE gene has been the focus of study. IE1 is believed to be the first de novo viral protein produced after HCMV infection and is essential for HCMV replication when HCMV is infected at a low multiplicity of infection (MOI). In general, IE1 has been considered as a gene activator. How IE1 activates gene expression is not fully understood. Several mechanisms that are involved in this activation (by IE1) have been described by different groups. First, IE1 interacts with nuclear corepressors such as PML, Daxx, and Sp100, thereby reducing their repressive effects on gene expression [15,16]. It was found by different groups independently that IE1 interacts with HDAC and inhibits HDAC&#8217;s activity [15,17]. Second, IE1 disperses ND10, a nuclear domain that contains many different nuclear suppressive proteins and responds to interferon stimulation [18,19,20,21]. In addition, innate cellular defense directed by interferons was disrupted by IE1 via inhibiting JAK-STAT signaling and by interacting with STAT1 [22,23,24]. The IE1 protein counteracts virus- or type I IFN-induced ISG activation via complex formation with STAT1 and STAT2 resulting in the reduced binding of ISGF3 to ISREs [22,23,24,25]. Last, IE1 is important for HCMV to arrest the cell cycle in the G1 phase that favors the infected HCMV for the cellular microenvironment. IE1 binds the Rb-related p107 protein and relieves its repression of E2F-responsive promoters [26]; IE1 also induces p53 accumulation through activating the p53 pathway by increasing the levels of p19Arf and by inducing the phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15 [27], which might also relate to the HCMV-caused &#8220;G1 arrest&#8221; of infected cells. The mechanisms used by IE1 to activate viral gene expression perhaps all depend on IE1-protein interactions. Therefore, it is important to identify the cellular proteins interacting with IE1 at a global level.\n2. Results\nOne of the major challenges in the post-genomic era is to explore the functional elements in the human genome. It also applies to the virus-host interaction. Identifying the cellular proteins that interact with the important virus proteins will certainly contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms that the virus uses for its gene expression and replication. Protein arrays constitute a powerful tool for high throughput and multiplexed protein analysis, including protein detection, the investigation of protein interactions with various types of molecules, and the determination of protein functions [28]. Protein array technology is highly sensitive and generates large amounts of data in a single experiment with comparatively low sample consumption; therefore, it is highly economical [28]. In current studies, we used protein array assays to screen cellular proteins that interact with HCMV IE1. Here we report our experimental results.First, we isolated the IE1 from an IE1-producing cell line (previously called U373-IE1, now called U-251 MG-IE1) [29] using a specific anti-IE1 antibody that was later incubated with beads-conjugated secondary antibody after which the beads were washed in binding/wash buffer (20 mM Na2HPO4, 0.15 M NaCl, pH 7.0). The pulled-down IE1 was washed off from the secondary antibody-bound beads with elution buffer (0.1 M glycine, pH 2&#8211;3), and the eluted solution was immediately neutralized with neutralization buffer (1 M Tris, pH 8.5). The isolated IE1 was confirmed by Western blot assay as shown in the top of Figure 1. Then the isolated IE1 was incubated at room temperature for 1 hour with the 22 cm &#215; 22 cm PVDF membranes presenting up to 7390 in situ expressed human proteins (Cat# Unipex_1, _2, library # 9027, #9028, imaGenes GmbH, Berlin, Germany). After 24 h of incubation with primary anti-IE1 antibody at 4 &#176;C, the membrane was washed with the buffer 2 times followed by incubation with a horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) and detection with enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA), according to standard methods. As can be seen in Figure 1A,B, 83 cellular proteins were found to bind to IE1. In the PVDF membrane, each in situ expressed cellular protein is presented in doublets, which is why we can see 2 dots together for each protein. We set up cutoffs according to the background index. Figure 1A,B represents 2 PVDF membranes that were processed at the same time with the same samples. The 83 proteins are listed in the Table 1 with their Gene bank #, name, function, and references. Further analysis of the 83 proteins revealed some important information: First, some of them have already been reported to interact with IE1. These are ATRX (#13) [15], splicing factor, arginine/serine-rich 2 (#40) [18], and Daxx (#65) [30]. Second, some of them are reported to be important for CMV infection but they have not been shown to interact with IE1, these are CDC25A (#10) [31], ATF4 (#41) [32], BCL-2 (#46) [33], and Ataxin (#39) [34]. In addition, 7 of the proteins that interact with IE1 are RNA binding proteins: RNA binding motif protein 10 (RBM10) (#5), RNA binding motif protein 5 (#20), Staufen, RNA binding protein (#26), splicing factor, arginine/serine-rich 2 (#40), heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein F (#52), RD RNA binding protein (#59), and PRP40 pre-mRNA processing factor 40 B (#60). All the RNA-bonding proteins are important for pre-mRNA processing. To our surprise, neither HDAC1, 2, or 3 nor TRIM19 (PML) is on the list; however, HDAC10 (#15) and TRIM33 (#57) are both detected as IE1-binding proteins with high signals (Figure 1).Since most of the IE1-interacting proteins in the Table 1 have not been reported, we need to validate the reliability of the results from the protein arrays. For that purpose, we performed a coimmunoprecipitation (coIP) assay using antibodies on hand to examine whether the proteins can be pulled down by the anti-IE1 antibody. The IE1-producing cell line (U-251 MG-IE1) [29] was cultured at 37 &#176;C until it reached 95% confluence. The nuclear extract was prepared according to the protocol as described in Material and Method section. The nuclear extracts were incubated with anti-IE1 antibody or with normal IgG and then secondary antibody-conjugated beads. After several washings, the eluted complexes from the beads were examined by Western blot assay using antibodies against the proteins as indicated in Figure 2. All the proteins from the list that are examined by Western blot assay were positive. We also examined the tubulin as control and it was negative. Therefore, the results from the protein arrays are reliable. \n3. Discussion\nHCMV infects a large part of the population and has serious consequences for immunocompromised persons with AIDS or who have received organ transplants and for newborns after congenital infection. In fact, HCMV is the leading viral cause of congenital birth defects [1]. More than 30% of primary HCMV infections in pregnant women result in placental transmission and clinical syndromes. Congenital infection is not uncommon [100,101,102]. Of symptomatic newborns, about 12% die and half of the survivors develop mental retardation, vision loss, and/or sensorineural deafness [103]. Interference strategies commonly target the early events of the replication cycle by using approved nucleoside analogs such as ganciclovir, the nucleotide analog cidofovir, and foscarnet. However, these can lead to resistance [104]. In vitro anti-sense oligonucleotides against the HCMV immediate-early protein 2 (IE2) have proven effective [105], as has targeting the UL36 and UL37 sites [105,106]. These attempts show that targeting the HCMV IE part of the propagation cycle may be effective; however, none of these treatments are permissible or feasible for use on a potentially infected fetus. The lack of suitable treatment modalities has especially serious consequences for the congenitally infected fetus and for patients with impaired immune systems. The challenge is to find treatment modalities that do not depend on the inhibition of the DNA replication process. This has attracted our investigation to the immediate-early (IE) stage of HCMV infection. Understanding IE1&#8217;s function is our first step in the development of a practical strategy against HCMV replication via interfering with IE1 function.In many cases, proteins play their biological role through interactions with other proteins. Especially for viral infection, viruses need to manipulate cellular function via interacting with cellular proteins. Therefore, the systematic identification and characterization of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is considered a key strategy to understand protein function. In the case of HCMV viral immediate-early products, IE1 might be the most important protein that initiates the early interactions between the virus and cells. The number of possible contacts between protein surfaces is astronomical. In this context, protein array technology opens up new avenues for the characterization of viral proteins and the identification of molecular partners involved in virus-mediated regulatory networks in cells. The array technology used in the present study started with incubation of IE1 with the PVDF membranes that carry GST-tagged human fusion proteins. Those fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli, and after native lysis with lysozyme, crude protein extracts were prepared under non-denaturing conditions in a 384-well plate format. The crude bacterial cell extracts were used for incubation overnight with the high-density spotted PVDF membranes, which were used to detect IE1-interacting proteins. Using the protein array, eighty-three cellular proteins in total were identified to be PPIs of HCMV IE1. Most of them were gene regulators. Only 3 IE1 PPIs from the list have been reported. However, many HCMV-mediated cell biological activities have been linked to IE1 (which link is also shown in these array assays); these activities include, among others, the interaction of IE1 with BCL-2, CDC25A, which interaction might be important for HCMV-induced &#8220;G1 arrest&#8221;. Some cellular proteins reported to interact with IE1 are not on the list, they might interact with IE1 only indirectly or the printed proteins are in different isoforms. For example, some isoforms of PML was found to interact with IE1 [15] but is not on the list because the other isoforms of PML are printed on the PVDF membranes. As shown on the Table 1, 7 RNA binding proteins are found to interact with IE1, implying that IE1 has a novel function in viral mRNA processing. In conclusion, our current effort in characterizing IE1&#8217;s PPIs resulted in the identification of 83 cellular proteins that directly interact with HCMV IE1. The results have been partially validated by coIP assay. With the data listed in the Table 1, we will further investigate the function of the PPIs of IE1.\n4. Experimental\n\n4.1. Tissue Culture and Viruses\nThe IE1-producing cell lines (U-251 MG-IE1) [29] were maintained in Dulbecco&#8217;s modified Eagle&#8217;s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. \n4.2. Antibodies\nThe monoclonal antibody against IE1 (MAB810) and the rabbit antibodies against cellular proteins were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). The rabbit antibodies included anti-SC35 (sc-28720), -TRIM33 (sc-68424), -HDAC10 (sc-130775), and -tubulin (sc-5546). Rabbit antibodies against RBM5 (ab69970) and RBM 10 (ab126112) were bought from Abcam (Cambridge, MA, USA)\n4.3. Preparation of Nuclear Extracts\nNuclear extracts were obtained essentially as described previously [15]. Briefly, monolayer cells were washed with PBS and scraped into fresh Eppendorf tubes. Cell pellets were resuspended in cold buffer A (10 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, at 4 &#176;C, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated for 10 min at 4 &#176;C. Then the cells were dounced with 10&#8211;20 plunges in a Kontes-B (Wheaton, DC, USA) Dounce Homogenizer (Pestle B) and poured into new bottles after centrifugation. The pellets were resuspended in cold buffer C (20 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 420 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) by vortexing and incubated for 30 min at 4 &#176;C. The pellets were dounced again with 10&#8211;20 plunges in Kontes-B (Wheaton) Dounce Homogenizer (Pestle B), and clarified extracts were transferred to fresh tubes and stored at &#8722;70 &#176;C until use. \n4.4. Coimmunoprecipitation\nAntibodies were coupled to protein G-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA, USA), according to the manufacturer&#8217;s instructions. After a wash with PBS-0.1% bovine serum albumin, the beads were incubated overnight at 4 &#176;C with clarified extracts, washed again in PBS-0.1% bovine serum albumin, and resuspended in a mixture of PBS and 2&#215; Laemmli buffer (20 &#181;L of each). After being heated for 5 min at 95 &#176;C, the beads were removed by centrifugation and supernatants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting.\n4.5. Immunoblot Analysis\nProteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-7.5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis [107] (10 to 20 &#181;g loaded in each lane), transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Inc., Piscataway, NJ, USA), and blocked with 5% nonfat milk for 60 min at room temperature. Membranes were incubated overnight at 4 &#176;C with primary antibody followed by incubation with a horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody (Amersham Inc.) and detection with enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA), according to standard methods. Membranes were stripped with stripping buffer (100 mM &#946;-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8), washed with PBS-0.1% Tween 20, and used to detect additional proteins.\n5. Conclusions\nWe currently used a protein array assay to identify HCMV IE1 interacting proteins. There are 83 cellular proteins that are PPIs of IE1 and most of the PPIs have not been reported previously. The interactions have been partially validated by coIP method which confirmed that the protein array assay is reliable.

The metabolic defect underlying PKU is a mutation in the gene coding for the enzyme, phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), which is responsible for the transformation of phenylalanine into tyrosine [2-4]. Impairment of PAH activity in PKU causes increased levels of phenylalanine that if untreated cause devastating damage to the brain, with severe mental disability, reduced IQ, seizures and tremors, impaired executive function, psychological and behavioural issues and social difficulties [4-6].Most patients with PKU are identified during neonatal screening [6] and all patients then require lifelong treatment [7]. The mainstay of the therapeutic management of PKU is a modified diet that includes specially manufactured foods low in protein, and phenylalanine-free amino acid supplements [3,4]. Maintaining adequate adherence to this diet is challenging, but effective in preventing the severe brain damage associated with uncontrolled blood phenylalanine, and allowing individuals with PKU to lead full and successful lives [5,7-9]. A pharmacologic treatment option, sapropterin, is available for prescription in a growing number of counties [10,11]. A number of other potential treatments that may contribute increasingly to the management of PKU in the future include better and more palatable phenylalanine-free foods, glycomacropeptide (a natural protein free of phenylalanine), large, neutral amino acids, phenylalanine-ammonia lyase (an injectable enzyme that metabolises phenylalanine) and &#8211; for the longer term &#8211; gene therapy approaches; these have been reviewed elsewhere [12].Preventing the severely adverse outcomes previously observed in people with PKU is one of the great success stories of modern medicine and PKU must not be given low priority in European healthcare agendas due to its relatively low prevalence: All patients deserve a level of treatment, which allows them to achieve optimal long-term outcomes. Nevertheless, there is considerable variability in clinical practice in PKU centres across Europe [13-15]. In this review, we set out to provide the first pan-European patient perspective on optimal PKU care and provide proposals for a minimum standard of care in the absence of universal European clinical guidelines. In this way, we provide a basis for healthcare professionals to develop evidence-based guidelines in the future.\nMethods\nA delegate workshop of the European Society for Phenylketonuria and Allied Disorders (E.S.PKU), involving 21 members from 15 countries, elected a working group (the co-authors) to prepare a consensus paper on best practice for the care of people with PKU, considering the current state and future direction of the management of PKU in Europe. The review is also based on data from the literature, findings from a benchmark report previously developed by the E.S.PKU and presented at the European Parliament in February 2012 (see Table&#160;1) [15], and experiences from patients and carers. The key findings from this report are summarised in Table&#160;1, and these implications of these issues for the future management of PKU are discussed below. For clarity, we include Turkey when considering the management of PKU in Europe throughout this article.\nInconsistent management of PKU in Europe\nThe management of PKU varies widely across Europe, including different approaches to defining PKU phenotypes, target levels for phenylalanine, and practices for following up patients [13-16]. The E.S.PKU benchmark report (Table&#160;1) found that published national guidelines for the management of PKU are available for only four countries, and none of these has been updated recently [15]. In addition, different countries employ different acceptable ranges for blood phenylalanine levels across age ranges. Phenylalanine thresholds for initiation of dietary management at screening vary from 300&#8211;600&#160;&#956;mol/L in different European countries. These differences persist throughout the patient&#8217;s life: for example, the upper bound of the target range for 10&#8211;12&#160;year olds varied from 240&#160;&#956;mol/L in Turkey to 900&#160;&#956;mol/L in Austria and Germany, with marked differences between countries for all other age ranges [3]. This inconsistency of approach has been confirmed by surveys conducted by expert groups working in this area [13,17].Limitations in the number of centres and healthcare professionals expert in the management of PKU and differences in the training and responsibilities of healthcare teams possibly contribute to this variability in treatment responses [15,17]. Moreover, the status and roles of dieticians/nutritionists differs between countries (there is no standardised qualification or international association for those managing diet in patients with PKU), as do practices for allocating a daily allowance of phenylalanine (some countries do not), systems for phenylalanine exchanges, and the types of food permitted [17]. Unsurprisingly, the proportion of patients with chronically elevated blood phenylalanine varies markedly across Europe with potentially adverse consequences for long-term neurocognitive outcomes [14].\nImproving the management of PKU in Europe\n\nScreening and diagnosis\nNeonatal screening for PKU is effective and cost-effective [6,18]. All countries except Finland and Malta (where the prevalence of PKU is low) include phenylalanine in national neonatal screening programmes. Neonatal screening for PKU should be mandatory and available at no cost to every family, to ensure universal coverage of the population. In the UK, for example, screening for PKU is offered free of charge for all newborns at 5&#160;days of age [19], although it is unclear what proportion of parents/carers refuse screening. An audit of the timing and true population coverage of newborn screening across Europe is warranted. Treatment (along with education of carers) should start immediately after confirmation of the diagnosis of PKU, as any delay in treatment exposes infants unnecessarilyto hyperphenylalaninaemia.The diagnosis of a lifelong genetic condition places a major burden on families [20], and trained personnel should be available to guide families through the nature of PKU, the consequences of the diagnosis for each stage of life and available treatment options [21]. Older individuals may have undiagnosed and consequently untreated PKU, particularly where neonatal screening has been introduced relatively recently [22]. Accordingly, measurement of phenylalanine should be performed in older individuals where signs of mental retardation are consistent with untreated PKU. Genotyping can contribute to diagnosis of the precise PKU phenotype in positive screenees, and should also be made universally available. Each patient should be tested for responsiveness to sapropterin, and each patient shown to be responsive to sapropterin should have access to this treatment. Finally, international registries are important for defining prevalence, assessing the uniformity of practice across regions, surveying standards of care, and as a starting point for future research programmes.\nAcceptable ranges for blood phenylalanine and other amino acids\nAn inconsistent approach to the management of blood phenylalanine in PKU is an important barrier to the adoption of uniform European guidelines for this condition, as described above. Although there are some differences on common phenotypes of PKU in Europe (milder forms of HPA/PKU are especially common in Spain, for example [23]), there is no reason to believe that the pathological effects of phenylalanine differ between the new born populations of different European countries. Evidence-based, age-dependent ranges for blood phenylalanine and other amino acids from birth onwards should be applied uniformly across Europe. Specific ranges will be needed for some specific patient groups, however, such as women who are pregnant or considering pregnancy, or late-treated patients who already have neurocognitive sequelae of untreated PKU. It is important to remember in this regard that a &#8220;target&#8221; or &#8220;goal&#8221; for phenylalanine, as commonly expressed, really sets an upper limit of the acceptable range for this amino acid. In reality, the patient&#8217;s target level should be set individually as the lowest possible safe level, as close as possible to non-PKU levels, but taking into account adherence and other practical issues. Conversely, there is a danger that overzealous management of blood phenylalanine, in the pursuit of blood levels close to those of people without PKU, could lead to levels being too low, and this should be avoided.Regular testing for blood phenylalanine (at intervals that vary with age) will be necessary to ensure continued optimal control of blood levels of phenylalanine and other amino acids. Members of the healthcare team must be able to provide timely and age-appropriate feedback, and access to a dietician/nutritionist is important to help patients improve their control of phenylalanine levels. Caregivers should also be trained to support the patient through the complex and challenging process of managing their PKU. Self-monitoring of blood phenylalanine has been discussed for some years, based on analogy to diabetes, where immediate information on blood glucoselevels allows patients to adjust their treatment to optimise metabolic control [24]. In principle, a home monitoring kit for blood phenylalanine could be a useful addition to themanagement of a well-motivated, knowledgeable and compliant patient. However, such an approach should never replace regular contact with the treatment centre. Home blood sampling provides a middle ground, where blood phenylalanine results are available more regularly compared with waiting for a clinic visit to have blood phenylalanine measured. A recent randomised trial found that increased access to blood phenylalanine results to facilitate self-management was popular with patients with PKU, but that there was no improvement in blood phenylalanine levels overall, or in the number of out-of-range levels [25]. The true place of home monitoring (or home blood sampling) in the management of PKU has yet to be established. As with other innovations in healthcare delivery, the establishment of a Europe-wide registry will be important to track evolving standards of care.Although most attention is focussed on the management of blood phenylalanine levels in PKU, as the best validated surrogate marker for risk of damage to the central nervous system, it is also important to ensure that people with PKU maintain adequate intake of amino acids other than phenylalanine [3,4].\nImportance of multidisciplinary care\nThe optimal management of PKU is challenging and a variety of healthcare professionals contribute importantly to the care of these patients, including physicians, dieticians/nutritionists and psychologists, with a designated member of the team, who has relevant training and expertise, to act as a central point of contact. In particular, the dietician/nutritionist has a number of key roles within the multidisciplinary team, including gathering information on eating behaviours, to support healthcare decisions. In addition, a paediatrician should initially follow the cognitive development of the child. Care pathways are designed to prevent the development ofcomplications of PKU, particularly neuropsychological deficits. It is important, therefore, that all patients have access to all members of the multidisciplinary team throughout their care, including a psychologist, rather than specialist referral only being arranged when the presence of an adverse outcome is already suspected. Finally, there is a need for adequate resources to prevent excessive case loads diluting access to care.This multidisciplinary approach is consistent with the requirements of a Centre of Excellence (CE), as defined recently by the European Union Committee of Experts on Rare Diseases [26]. The main requirements for such a Centre of Excellence [27] are summarised below:&#8226;Sufficient professional qualification (certification or accreditation and a number of recognised publications) at both clinical and scientific level, and an agreed commitment to cooperate and share information among professionals;&#8226;An annual Activity Report comparing performance with the preceding year;&#8226;Patient access to a multi-disciplinary team of experts (see above);&#8226;A holistic approach integrating medical and social aspects;&#8226;Combination of research and care with commitment to participate in research activities at European and international level, if appropriate;&#8226;Education, information and communication outreach activities with the public and primary health care professionals;&#8226;Training for health professionals;&#8226;Activities to empower patients and collaboration with patient organisations;&#8226;E-health solutions (e.g. shared case management systems and systems for tele-expertise or online patient communication) shall be considered (with sufficient data protection).The number of CEs should depend on country-size and population density and offer a good balance between accessibility and experience. European countries outside the European Union (EU) should adopt as many as possible the same criteria for quality of care (although local situations related to, e.g. funding or numbers of patients may render full compliance impractical for some centres, at least in the short term). Transition from the current decentralised care systems to an international, networked system of CEs will take time, and intermediate quality standards may be needed in the interim. The recommendation on CE follows an earlier EU recommendation from 2009, which advises the establishment of an international (PKU) centre for medical education and clinical research within an EU network [27]. Patient advocacy organisations, including the E.S.PKU and its member organisations, have a key role to play in the evolution of a truly international focus on improving standards of care for people with PKU.\nEducation\nThe challenging nature of following a special diet throughout life (essential for the majority of patients with PKU) places a special emphasis on the need for education. In infancy, the diet of the child is determined entirely by the primary caregiver(s). There is some evidence that the level of blood phenylalanine in a child with PKU varies inversely with the mother&#8217;s level of knowledge of dietary management for this condition [28]. The growing child will exert increasing influence on dietary choices, and will experience increasing opportunity to eat prohibited foods while not under the caregiver&#8217;s direct control, especially during adolescence (see the section on transition to adult care, below). Accordingly, education of patients, caregivers and other groups involved in the care of the child, such as schools, will be required at appropriate times, using age-appropriate language and materials. Education must be reinforced periodically, as shown by studies where one-off educational interventions initially improved knowledge of dietary management of PKU and/or blood phenylalanine levels, followed by a disappearance of these benefits over a period of months [29,30]. Given the difficulty of maintaining strict dietary control, a relaxation of vigilance over time on the part of patient or caregiver may also be a source of poor control of blood phenylalanine, again requiring reinforcement of the need for and benefit of optimal dietary management. It is important to remember that improving knowledge about the appropriate management of PKU does not always lead to improved compliance, and patients must be motivated to do so [30].\nSpecial patient groups\n\nTransition from paediatric to adult care\nThe transition from paediatric to adult care is problematic in PKU, as with other diseases that place a challenging burden of adherence to difficult treatment regimens. Studies have demonstrated poorer control of blood phenylalanine levels in adolescent patients compared with younger patients) [31,32]. Indeed, more complex treatment regimens in general are associated, on average, with poorer outcomes during the transition from paediatric to adult care [33]. Adolescence is a time of emotional turmoil and young people commonly experiment with autonomy and challenge sources of authority at this time. In addition, adolescents with PKU are subject to peer pressure to eat everyday foods with their non-PKU peers in social situations.It is important to note that, although indices of quality of life and educational or professional achievement are not impaired on average, achieving autonomy and forming mature adult relationships are somewhat delayed in individuals with PKU [34], suggesting that healthcare professionals should address issues additional to control of phenylalanine levels from early on. Careful management of dietary or pharmacologic control of PKU is feasible in adolescents, when these individuals are managed appropriately. Parenting style influences blood phenylalanine levels in young patients with PKU, and parents may need support and counselling to manage the transition of their child with PKU to adult care services [35]. A lack of confidence among generalist physicians in dealing with patients with chronic diseases of childhood origin places emphasis on the need for specialised knowledge of the management of rare inherited diseases, such as PKU, with continuity of care from an expert, multidisciplinary healthcare team [36]. The involvement of a psychologist within the multidisciplinary team is particularly important, especially at times of a change in the patient&#8217;s life, to prevent or deal with emotional or psychosocial issues that may impair compliance with therapeutic management of PKU.The management of adults with PKU is often incompletely understood [36,37]. Only a small number of European centres currently provide healthcare teams with specific expertise in the management of adult patients with PKU. Increasing the ability of centres to manage adult patients would provide an important improvement to the lifelong care of these patients.\nWomen of childbearing age and PKU in pregnancy\nUncontrolled HPA is teratogenic, producing a range of severe cognitive, neurological and physical deficits that resemble those of foetal alcohol syndrome. Damage to the foetus occurs early in PKU, and female patients of childbearing age need to be counselled and educated on the dangers of unplanned pregnancy (coordinated medical and nutritional control and monitoring should be established before and during a pregnancy). Available clinical evidence suggests that, for an unplanned pregnancy, establishing control of phenylalanine during the first trimester is essential to protect the developing foetus [38]. Adults with PKU who have been off-diet often find it difficult to resume dietary control [39], and immediate multidisciplinary support is required should a woman with PKU known to be considering a pregnancy. Specific guidelines for more intensive nutritional and metabolic monitoring are required for women considering pregnancy and throughout pregnancy.\nPatients with PKU not complying with dietary management\nMany patients with PKU lose contact with physicians, and resuming dietary adherence is challenging. However, data from adolescents and adults with PKU suggest that resuming adequate control of blood phenylalanine confers a range of benefits related to self-reported general health, psychosocial outcomes (happiness, alertness, impulsivity, calmness, vitality), quality of life and reduced mood swings [39,40]. Studies employing electroencephalography and positron emission tomography have demonstrated improvements in indices of brain function after improved control of blood phenylalanine [41,42]. Patients who discontinue dietary management should be followed up by healthcare professionals [21]. Special foods for PKU have been described by patients as lacking palatability [15], although these foods have improved in recent years [8] and further improvements in these products may help to support better compliance.Some patients who never received dietary management, with consequent severe cognitive deficit, can be found in care homes in most European countries. These patients should be actively sought out, as dietary management can improve their quality of life [43,44]. Care home staff should be encouraged to work with healthcare professionals in managing these patients.\nCost and reimbursement issues\nAny guideline for the management of PKU will stress the importance of adherence to the special diet, but the requirements for managing the special diet of a patient with PKU places a significant cost burden on families (Figure&#160;1) which will represent a significant barrier to the delivery of evidence-based care [45]. Phenylalanine-free food is an essential therapeutic intervention for people with PKU: this should be accessible to all patients without any obstacles, ideally distributed through the same distribution channels as amino acid supplements (pharmacies) and subsidised fully. Nutritional deficiency can complicate the dietary management of PKU [46], so every patient should be supplied with sufficient supplies of other supplements (micronutrients, fatty acids), as determined by the healthcare team. Indeed, a government subsidy program to finance all treatment options should be considered to increase accessibility to optimal care for patients, and this should be uniform across Europe to support pan-European guidelines. Patients/caregivers should receive appropriate support for adequate amino acid supplements and low protein foods. Providing special foods and supplements themselves, rather than funds to obtain them, may be one means of ensuring that patients receive the correct dietary intervention. Other areas important for reimbursement include outpatient multidisciplinary consultations and treatment (diet and/or drugs), neurocognitive and psychosocial assessment and management, additional diagnostic tests if required, regular blood tests for phenylalanine and other amino acids, regular blood tests for vitamins and micronutrients as prescribed, bone density measurement, brain imaging and neurophysiological testing if needed, genetic testing and counselling and advice for family planning.Treatment with sapropterin allows a subset of patients to broaden their diet to include more natural protein (some can tolerate a normal diet for the first time after starting sapropterin) and this may improve the quality of life of some patients [11]. Sapropterin treatment should be reimbursed when the importance of improving either metabolic control or decreasing the need of strictness in dietary treatment has been demonstrated. A similar approach applies to new treatments currently in clinical development, once adequate efficacy and safety has been established. Patient organisations, working with healthcare professionals, have an important role here in disseminating reliable information about new treatment modalities to patients and their families.\nConclusions\nThere is a clear need to achieve greater uniformity in management practices for patients with PKU across Europe, involving both a greater focus on evidence-based care and also greater involvement of patients, consistent with modern concepts of concordance between patients and physicians [47]. To achieve this, the E.S.PKU is currently working with expert healthcare professionals involved in the management of PKU to produce the first pan-European, evidence-based guideline for the management of PKU. This guideline will establish a minimum standard of care that should become achievable in all countries through uniform access to expert multidisciplinary care, and to dietary and/or pharmacologic treatments. When the guideline is available, we will remain committed to supporting our national member associations to encourage healthcare professionals to adopt and implement the new European guideline to achieve a better and more consistent quality of care for all European PKU patients.It is crucial that the patient&#8217;s perspective is central to the development of these guidelines, as we have set out in this article. Experience in other therapeutic areas has demonstrated the benefits of including a patient perspective in developing management guidelines for chronic, non-communicable diseases [48]. The E.S.PKU urges PKU healthcare professionals caring for people with PKU world wide to take the lead in developing evidence based guidelines on PKU, while continuing to play an active role in serving as the voice of patients and their families, whose lives are affected by the condition.\nAbbreviations\nPKU: Phenylketonuria; E.S.PKU: European society for phenylketonuria and allied disorders; PAH: Phenylalanine hydroxylase; HPA: Hyperphenylalaninaemia; BH4: Tetrahydrobiopterin; CE: Centre of excellence; EU: European Union.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.

The loss of porins was due to incapability of phosphorylation, which is essential for porin transcription and carbapenem resistance. We also characterized other genes that are regulated by ompR in this mutant, which contributed to bacterial antibiotic resistance. Overall, our studies suggest antibiotic pressure after conjugation might be an alternative pathway to promote antimicrobial resistance.", "body": "Introduction\nDevelopment of antibiotic resistance among Enterobacteriaceae has become a worldwide health issue1. In the past, extended-spectrum &#946;-lactamases (ESBLs), which hydrolyze extended-spectrum cephalosporins, have emerged and carbapenems were regarded as a last resort antibiotic2. However, the development of carbapenemases that can inactivate the carbapenems substantially increases the burden of clinical treatment at hospitals. New Delhi metallo-&#946;-lactamase 1 (NDM-1) is one of the dominant carbapenemases. The NDM-1 gene (blaNDM-1) was first identified from a strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae in India3, and has since been found in various Gram-negative pathogens4. Conjugative transfer of plasmids is one of the major pathways to disseminate blaNDM-1 among bacteria, regardless of their species and class. In recent years, numerous plasmids carrying the NDM-1 gene, including both narrow (IncFII) and broad host range (IncM, IncA/C, IncH and IncX3) plasmids5,6, have been reported to associate with other classes of antibiotic-resistance genes, constraining therapeutic options for the infections caused by bacteria carrying these plasmids7,8.Apart from antibiotic degradation enzymes, reduced expression of porins is a complementary mechanism to confer carbapenem resistance in bacteria9. Porins are outer membrane proteins that act as a selective barrier to protect bacteria from harmful substances and function as channels for molecules to diffuse into the cytoplasm. In Escherichia coli (E. coli), OmpC, OmpF and PhoE are porins that control the influx of metabolites, amino acids and antibiotics10. Down-regulating these genes would reduce the permeability of porin, resulting in mitigated antibiotic resistance. Notably, clinical isolates with carbapenem resistance are often associated with porin loss11,12.In the last decade, the relationship between gene regulation and antibiotic resistance, as well as the environmental factors that initiate gene moderation to activate antibiotic resistance pathways, have been widely studied13. It was suggested that incubating bacteria with sublethal concentration of antibiotics altered gene expression for adaptation and survival14. Moreover, antibiotics have been shown to act as the selective driver to influence the physiology of bacteria, such as conjugation dynamics15. Nevertheless, the effect from the selective pressure of antibiotics in terms of bacterial adaptation and their responses leading to further development of antibiotic resistance, particularly in the presence of antibiotic resistance plasmids, remain limited.Previously, we isolated the first NDM-1 positive E. coli strain in Hong Kong and sequenced the corresponding plasmid pNDM-HK16. We found that the 90&#8201;kb plasmid contains a 55&#8201;kb backbone and a 28.9&#8201;kb variable region. The backbone shared 97% homology with pEL60 originated from the plant pathogen Erwinia amylovora, while the variable region encodes resistant determinants to &#946;-lactams (blaNDM-1, blaTEM-1, blaDHA-1), aminoglycosides (aacC2, armA), sulphonamides (sul1) and macrolides (mel, mph2). It is in high homology to pCTX-M3 plasmid which has been associated with the dissemination of CTX-M type &#946;-lactam resistance with the difference of a unique region of blaNDM-1. In order to understand the effect of antibiotics on bacteria carrying pNDM-HK, we conjugated pNDM-HK to E. coli J53 from a clinical isolate and selected using different concentrations of meropenem. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of transconjugants was drastically changed under different conditions. Transconjugants selected by higher dosage of meropenem exhibited stronger carbapenem resistance. Transcriptomic analysis of these isogenic transconjugants indicated the development of stronger resistance was attributed to a novel point mutation G63S on the porin transcription factor, ompR, leading to the loss of porin. Our findings highlighted the importance of antibiotic selective pressure to bacterial physiology and their manipulations on gene expression for further developing stronger antibiotic resistance strains.\nMaterials and Methods\n\nBacterial strains and growth conditions\nThe E. coli strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table&#160;S1. DH5&#945; and BL21(DE3) were used for cloning and overexpression of proteins, respectively. E. coli K-12 strains BW25113, JW2203, JW0912 and JW3368 were provided by the National BioResource Project at NIG17. Bacteria were grown in LB broth at 37&#8201;&#176;C under shaking at 250&#8201;rpm. Antibiotic concentrations in growth media were applied as below: meropenem 0.12&#8201;&#181;g/ml, ampicillin 100&#8201;&#181;g/ml, kanamycin 25&#8201;&#181;g/ml or chloramphenicol 25&#8201;&#181;g/ml.\nConjugation\nConjugation was performed using E. coli J53Azr as the recipient. Donor strain E. coli (HK-01) were grown to late-exponential phase in LB and cell number was adjusted to 1.5&#8201;&#215;&#8201;108 cells/ml. Donor and recipient cells were combined in LB broth without antibiotic in a 1:2 donor-to-recipient ratio at 37&#8201;&#176;C for 16&#8201;h. Transconjugants were selected using LB agar plates containing sodium azide (100&#8201;&#956;g/ml) and different concentrations of meropenem (0.12, 0.5, 1 and 2&#8201;&#181;g/ml). The transfer frequencies were obtained as the number of transconjugants per donor cell. After selection, all the transconjugants were cultured under the same concentration of meropenem (0.12&#8201;&#181;g/ml).\nGrowth curve measurement\nTransconjugants were cultured in 50&#8201;mL LB at 37&#8201;&#176;C with continuous shaking at 250&#8201;rpm. The optical density at 600&#8201;nm (OD600) was measured by Spectrophotometer (UV mini-1240) until stationary phase at every hour. Growth curve was plotted using absorbance 600&#8201;nm as y-axis and time as x-axis. Absorbance at each time point was calculated using the mean of biological duplicates. The bacteria&#8217;s doubling time of bacteria was determined by the period of time needed to grow from exponential phase to stationary phase.\nPlasmid and strain construction\nDNA purification, restriction endonuclease cleavage, ligation and transformation were carried out according to the manufacturer&#8217;s protocols. In particular, TIANprep Rapid Mini Plasmid Kit (DP105) was applied for plasmid extraction based on the reference procedure. Coding sequence of ompR was amplified from transconjugants NDM-T21a and NDM-TC, and cloned into pET28a to generate His-WT-OmpR and His-G63S-OmpR, respectively. Mutation D55A of OmpR was constructed using two-primer site-directed mutagenesis. Briefly, two complementary primers encoding 50 nucleotides with the desired mutation sites in the middle of primers were utilized. The PCR reaction involved 20 cycles at 98&#8201;&#176;C (10&#8201;seconds), 42&#8201;&#176;C (1&#8201;minute) and 72&#8201;&#176;C (7&#8201;minutes) using iProof DNA-polymerase (Bio-Rad) with pTL39 (pET28a-ompR) as template. The reaction was then digested with Dpn I (NEB) to remove the template plasmid, purified and transformed into DH5&#945;. For EnvZc expression, C terminal (R180-G450) of EnvZ was subcloned into pGEX-6P-1 to generate GST-EnvZc and transformed into BL21 (DE3). Transcription units of ompR in NDM-T21a and NDM-TC, ranging from &#8722;250 to +840&#8201;bp, were cloned into single-copy vector pNN387 to generate pTL74 and pTL75.\nRNA extraction and library construction\nTransconjugants NDM-T21a and NDM-TC were grown to early stationary phase (OD600 ~2). Cell pellets were mixed with 3 volumes of TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and the RNA was extracted by adding 1 volume of chloroform followed by centrifugation. Total RNA was precipitated in isopropanol, and the concentration was measured using NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo). The quality of RNA was determined by TAE agarose gel electrophoresis.Messenger RNA was enriched and separated from small RNA using a mirVana&#8482; miRNA Isolation Kit (Life Technologies) and further subjected to a MICROBExpress Kit (Ambion) and a Ribo-Zero rRNA Removal Kit (Epicentre) to remove ribosomal RNA according to the manufacturer&#8217;s instructions. The concentration of mRNA was measured by ND-1000 (Thermo) and the quality was determined by a Bioanalyzer (Agilent) using an RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Life Technologies).\nRNA sequencing and data analysis\nThe rRNA-depleted RNA was used to construct the library with the Ion Total RNA-Seq Kit v2 (Ambion) according to the manufacturer&#8217;s instructions. Libraries were next sequenced using the ion Torrent sequencing platform on Ion 318 Chips (Life Technologies). Reads were mapped to reference genome E. coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655 (GenBank accession NC_000913.3) using TMAP18&#8211;22. Those mapped sequencing reads were visualized using an Integrated Genome Viewer (IGV) 2.3.3423. The number of reads mapped to each gene was normalized to the gene expression level according to gene length, sum of read length, and the total number of mapped reads.\nProtein purification\nBacteria with the plasmids encoding the desired gene were grown to OD600~0.6 at 37&#8201;&#176;C, and 1&#8201;mM IPTG was added to induce protein expression. After shaking for 4&#8201;hours, cells were harvested by centrifugation and re-suspended in a lysis buffer (20&#8201;mM Tris-HCl, 150&#8201;mM NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.4&#8201;mM PMSF and 2&#8201;mM &#946;-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.5). For the purification of OmpR, bacteria were lysed by sonication and protein was purified using a TALON Cobalt column (Clontech).High salt wash buffer (20&#8201;mM Tris-HCl, 500&#8201;mM NaCl, 20&#8201;mM imidazole, 2&#8201;mM &#946;-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.5) and low salt wash buffer (20&#8201;mM Tris-HCl, 150&#8201;mM NaCl, 20&#8201;mM imidazole and 2&#8201;mM &#946;-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.5) were used to eliminate non-specific binding. The OmpR protein was eluted by elution buffer (20&#8201;mM Tris-HCl, 150&#8201;mM NaCl, 250&#8201;mM imidazole and 2&#8201;mM &#946;-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.5).For purification of EnvZ, supernatant was loaded on the glutathione column (GE healthcare), washed with buffer (20&#8201;mM Tris-HCl, 350&#8201;mM NaCl and 2&#8201;mM &#946;-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.5) and eluted by elution buffer (20&#8201;mM Tris-HCl, 150&#8201;mM NaCl, 10&#8201;mM reduced glutathione and 2&#8201;mM &#946;-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.5). All purified proteins were dialyzed against storage buffer (20&#8201;mM Tris-HCl, 200&#8201;mM NaCl and 10% glycerol, pH 7.5) at 4&#8201;&#176;C overnight. Protein purity and concentration were determined by A280/A260 and SDS-PAGE (Purity&#8201;>&#8201;95%).\nEnvZ phosphorylation assay\nTo prepare the 32P labelled phosphorylated form of EnvZ, EnvZ (1&#8201;&#181;M) was phosphorylated in a 150&#8201;&#181;L buffer containing 50&#8201;mM Tris (pH 7.5), 50&#8201;mM KCl, 5&#8201;mM CaCl2, 2&#8201;mM &#946;-mercaptoethanol, and 35 &#181;Ci [&#947;-32P] ATP at room temperature for 20&#8201;minutes. The reaction mixture was then passed through a Centri-Spin 10 column (Princeton Separations) to remove excess [&#947;-32P] ATP. To perform the assay, OmpR or mutant (1&#8201;&#181;M) was mixed with the phosphorylated EnvZ mixture. The reaction was kept on ice and terminated at the indicated time by adding stop buffer (124&#8201;mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 20% glycerol, 4% SDS, 8% &#946;-mercaptoethanol and 0.025% bromophenol blue). The products were separated using 12% SDS-PAGE, and the image was analyzed by phosphor-imager.\nQuantitative Real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)\nTo remove the contaminated DNA, RNA was treated with 2U TURBO DNase (Ambion) at 37&#8201;&#176;C for 30&#8201;min twice, and incubated with 1/10 (v/v) inactivation reagent (Ambion) to inactivate DNase. For quality control, resulting RNA was subjected to a DNA contamination test by PCR using gapA primers. One &#181;g qualified RNA was next reverse-transcribed into cDNA by Superscript III First-Strand Synthesis System (Life Technologies) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Primers for qRT-PCR were designed with Primer3 software24 and listed in Table&#160;S2. The gene gapA served as the endogenous control for normalization. The reaction was set up with 5&#8201;&#181;l Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Life Technologies), 1&#8201;&#181;l cDNA, 2&#8201;&#181;M forward and reverse primers, and appropriate nuclease-free water to a total volume of 10&#8201;&#181;l per reaction. The PCR was run on a 7500 Fast Real-time PCR System (ABI) with a program of 95&#8201;&#176;C 5&#8201;min for 1 cycle, and 95&#8201;&#176;C 15&#8201;s, 60&#8201;&#176;C 1&#8201;min for 40 cycles. Each qRT-PCR analysis was performed in triplicate, whereas expression levels were calculated by Ct values using the formula 2&#8722;&#9651;&#9651;Ct.\nWestern Blot\nAround 2&#8201;&#215;&#8201;107 cells were used for sodium dodecyl sulfate&#8722;polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS&#8722;PAGE). Following that, proteins were transferred to the nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) with transfer buffer (25&#8201;mM Tris, 192&#8201;mM glycine and 10% methanol) at 120&#8201;V for 90&#8201;min. The membrane was then blocked with 5% nonfat milk in TBST solution (20&#8201;mM Tris, 150&#8201;mM NaCl and 0.1% Tween-20) at room temperature for 1&#8201;hour. After blocking, the membrane was immersed with polyclonal anti-NDM-1 antibody (Novus) and subsequently incubated with the goat anti-rabbit IgG HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (BioRad). Monoclonal mouse anti-GAPDH antibody (Cell Biolabs) was utilized to quantify the loading amount. Signals were obtained using a LAS 4000 chemiluminescent imager (Fuji) with the addition of Clarity&#8482; western ECL substrate (Bio-Rad).\nAgar Disc Diffusion Assay\nPeptide alafosfalin (L-alanyl-L-aminoethylphosphonic acid) was purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Alafosfalin was dissolved in nuclease-free water with the desired concentration and was loaded onto 6&#8201;mm filter paper discs (Whatman). Bacterial suspension was diluted from overnight culture to a density of 1.5&#8201;&#215;&#8201;108 cfu ml&#8722;1. Paper discs containing various concentrations of peptide were placed on LB agar inoculated with bacteria, where agar plates were kept at 37&#8201;&#176;C for 16&#8201;hours. The diameters of inhibition zones were calculated from biological triplicates.\nAntimicrobial susceptibility test\nMinimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of bacteria to doripenem, ertapenem, imipenem and meropenem were determined by Etest strips (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden). The susceptibility results were interpreted according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guideline 2018 with E. coli strain ATCC 25922 as quality control of the susceptibility test.\nResults\n\nDependence of minimum inhibitory concentration of transconjugants on antibiotic selection concentration\nIn order to interpret the effect of antibiotic on selection process, the plasmid was firstly conjugated from the clinical isolate (E.coli, HK-01) to E.coli J53 and selected with four different concentrations of meropenem. The transfer frequencies and MICs of the transconjugants were measured and compared in Table&#160;1. After conjugation, MIC of transconjugant was slightly enhanced from 0.75 to 4&#8201;&#956;g/ml under low dosage selection, which was possibly due to different host backgrounds. Interestingly, transconjugants selected from higher concentration of meropenem (1 and 2&#8201;&#181;g/ml) possessed extremely strong antibiotic resistance to imipenem, meropenem, ertapenem, and doripenem. Notably, these two selection concentrations were higher than the MIC of the donor strain HK-01.Table 1MICs and conjugation frequencies of different pNDM-HK transconjugants, donor and recipient strain.StrainsAntibiotic used for selection (concentration &#181;g/ml)Transfer frequencyMIC (&#181;g/ml)IPMMEMETPDORDonor, HK-010.750.751.51.5Recipient J530.190.0160.0060.016TransconjugantsNDM-T21aMeropenem (0.12)1.8&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10&#8722;38464NDM-T27bMeropenem (0.5)1.8&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10&#8722;48644NDM-T4aMeropenem (1)2.7&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10&#8722;6>32>32>32>32NDM-TCMeropenem (2)2.1&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10&#8722;8>32>32>32>32Abbreviation:IMP, imipenem; MEN, meropenem; ETP, ertapenem; DOR, doripenem.\nTranscriptomic analysis identified G63S OmpR mutant in NDM-TC\nTo determine whether NDM-1 contributed to the antibiotic resistance of transconjugants, we measured the protein level of NDM-1 in both NDM-T21a and NDM-TC strains which expressed the lowest and highest MICs respectively. As shown by Western blot analysis (Fig.&#160;S1), no significant difference was observed in both strains, indicating the increment of MIC in NDM-TC was not due to the antibiotic degrading enzyme (NDM-1) overexpressed from the plasmid. To unravel the carbapenem resistance mechanism of NDM-TC, we sequenced the transcriptomes (RNA-seq) of NDM-T21a and NDM-TC, and compared their expression profiles. A total number of 1,501,725, and 1,765,361 reads were obtained for NDM-T21a and NDM-TC, respectively. Raw reads with low abundance were filtered to reduce random errors. Sixty percent of total reads were mapped to the coding region and others were mapped to tmRNA and non-coding RNAs (Fig.&#160;S2a). We compared the expression levels between NDM-T21a and NDM-TC by log2(NDM-TC/NDM-T21a). Genes with fold changes larger than +2 or smaller than &#8722;2 are considered as differentially expressed. For chromosomal genes, 43 of them were repressed, whereas 77 genes showed up-regulation among NDM-TC, which account for 5% of the mapped genome (Fig.&#160;S2b). In addition, differential expressions were also found in plasmid-encoded genes among two transconjugants. A total of 5 genes of plasmids were significantly altered in NDM-TC as shown in Fig.&#160;S2c, suggesting a portion of metabolic pathways were evolved in NDM-TC during the selection process. Chromosomal and plasmid-encoded genes with differential expression were listed in Datasets&#160;S1 and S2 respectively.In our sequencing results, gene expression level of &#946;-lactam resistance genes such as blaTEM-1 was similar in both NDM-T21a and NDM-TC, indicating that the enhancement of MIC in NDM-TC was not attributed to other &#946;-lactamases (Fig.&#160;S3). Since drug susceptibility of bacteria can be controlled by the membrane proteins, we then compared the expression level of genes related to import and export pathways. Interestingly, a significant down-regulation of porin genes (ompC and ompF) up to 5-fold were observed in NDM-TC compared with NDM-T21a (Fig.&#160;1). On the other hand, most efflux pump genes including acrA, acrB and tolC showed similar expression in all transconjugants. The expression levels of porin genes among two transconjugants were further quantified by qRT-PCR as shown in Fig.&#160;S4 while the fold change of efflux pump genes were listed in Dataset&#160;S3. Notably, reducing porin expression was reported as one of the major mechanisms of cephalosporin and carbapenem resistance9,10 and thereby, possibly resulted in high MIC of NDM-TC. To further investigate the regulatory mechanism of porins, we sequenced the whole transcriptional cassettes of ompC and ompF, including the leader and coding sequences. However, no genetic insertion, mutation or deletion was found in any region of these two genes. On the other hand, we identified a G183A nonsynonymous mutation in the coding region of ompR, resulting in an amino acid substitution from glycine to serine at position 63 (G63S) in OmpR protein (Fig.&#160;S5). OmpR is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of ompC and ompF.Figure 1Read-count of genes related to the outer membrane protein and efflux pump in RNA-Seq. The read-count of (a) ompC, (b) ompF, (c) ompR, (d) acrA, (e) acrB and (f) tolC in transconjugants NDM-T21a (grey column) and NDM-TC (white column) are shown. IGV-captured diagrams with the same scale are placed next to the bar chart.\nG63S OmpR abolishes \nTo study the correlation between ompR G183A mutation and porin expression, we compared the expression of ompC and ompF in null ompR allele (&#8710;ompR) and mutants recovered from either wild type (&#8710;ompR/WT) or G63S OmpR (&#8710;ompR/G63S). As shown in Fig.&#160;2a, both wild type and G63S OmpR complements were successfully expressed in the &#8710;ompR strains. Moreover, overexpression of wild type OmpR completely restored the expression of ompC and ompF. On the other hand, no effect was observed in &#8710;ompR strains complemented with G63S OmpR (Fig.&#160;2b,c). This finding demonstrated that G63S OmpR was not able to activate gene expression of porins.Figure 2Transcription of (a) ompR, (b) ompC and (c) ompF in wild type and OmpR mutant obtained in qRT-PCT. Relative gene expressions are shown in wild type E.coli (white column), in the absence of ompR (black column), wild type OmpR recovered in null ompR allele (hatched column) and G63S OmpR recovered in null ompR allele (grey column). Vertical error bars show the standard deviations of biological triplicates. The expression level obtained in wild type was taken as a reference for comparison. *P-value&#8201;<&#8201;0.05; **P-value&#8201;<&#8201;0.01; ***P-value&#8201;<&#8201;0.001.\nFailure of G63S OmpR phosphorylation by EnvZ\nPorin expression is mainly controlled by a signal transduction system in which sensor kinase EnvZ interplays with the response regulator OmpR. To activate porin transcription, the phosphorylated form of EnvZ is required to transfer the phosphoryl group to aspartic acid 55 (D55) of OmpR. The phosphorylation of OmpR induces the dimerization of the monomer, which then enhances its affinity to ompC and ompF transcription factor binding sites for gene activation. Since Glycine 63 of OmpR is located at the N-terminal phosphorylation domain, G63S mutation possibly affects the phosphorylation of OmpR. To find out, a recombinant and purified truncated form of EnvZ was used to test the phosphorylation of either wild type or G63S OmpR. The reaction process was monitored at 1 and 5&#8201;minutes. As shown in Fig.&#160;3, the EnvZ was labelled with 32P-ATP by autophosphorylation (lane 1) and D55A OmpR mutant25 was used as a negative control (lanes 6 and 7). In lanes 2 and 3, the phosphorylated EnvZ (EnvZ-P) transferred the [32P] phosphoryl group to wild type OmpR after one minute of incubation, but no phosphorylation was observed in G63S OmpR (lanes 4 and 5). Phosphorylation of OmpR is essential to promote the binding on the promoter of ompC and ompF25, as well as to initiate gene transcription. G63S OmpR possibly fail to initiate porin transcription, resulting in carbapenem resistance in NDM-TC.Figure 3Phosphorylation of wild type, G63S and D55A OmpR by truncated EnvZ. Around 1&#8201;&#181;g of EnvZ was autophosphorylated by 32P-ATP in lane 1. Approximately 0.28&#8201;&#181;g of wild type OmpR (lanes 2&#8211;3), G63S mutant (lanes 4&#8211;5) or D55A mutant (lanes 6&#8211;7) were mixed with phosphorylated EnvZ. The reaction was terminated by adding stop buffer at 1&#8201;minute (lanes 2, 4 and 6), or 5&#8201;minutes (lanes 3, 5 and 7). The molecular weight ladder is marked on the right column. Full image is shown in Supplementary Figure&#160;S6.\nModeling of G63S OmpR\nTo further understand the molecular basis of G63S mutation restricting OmpR phosphorylation, we built the model of G63S OmpR by homology modelling with the C- and N- terminal domains structures of OmpR in E. coli (1ODD and 1OPC) using SWISS-MODEL. As shown in Fig.&#160;4, aspartic acid at position 55 (Asp55), the residue that undergoes phosphorylation, is in close proximity with Glycine 63 (G63) and Threonine 83 (T83). Mutation of T83 has been shown to inhibit the phosphorylation of Asp55. The change of glycine to serine could introduce a charge and steric hindrance effect at the phosphorylation site of OmpR, thereby inhibiting the reaction.Figure 4Molecular model of OmpR. The dimer form of OmpR structure and the zoom-in region of the phosphorylation site Asp55 are shown. The monomer of OmpR is shown in yellow and magenta color. The residues Asp55, Gly63 and Thr83 are highlighted in ball-and-stick format and colored by element (carbon, gray; nitrogen, blue; oxygen, red). The figures were produced using Discovery Studio visualizer (Accelrys).\nContribution of OmpR to carbapenem resistance\nLoss of porin restricts the influx of drug to the periplasm, and thereby enhances antibiotic resistance9. Mutations in ompC and ompF have often been identified in drug-resistant pathogens11,26 while ompR mutations have been reported to promote carbapenem resistance in cephalosporinase producing bacteria27&#8211;29. However, the combinational effect of ompR mutation and the presence of carbapenemase has rarely been described. In order to study this effect, we transformed pNDM-HK into null ompC, ompF or ompR allele of E.coli K-12 strains and measured their MICs. As shown in Table&#160;S3, all strains carrying pNDM-HK exhibited at least a 100-fold increase of carbapenem resistance compared with their corresponding isogenic strains. Moreover, the effect of carbapenem resistance became stronger in null ompR and G63S ompR mutants, suggesting the synergistic effect between ompR and carbapenemase in antibiotic resistance.\nRegulation of other metabolic pathways by OmpR\nIn addition to the alleviated expression of porin contributing to the carbapenem resistance in NDM-TC, down-regulation of other genes including curli subunit gene D (csgD) and tripeptide permease A (dtpA) were observed in the sequencing result, and their gene expression levels were further validated by qRT-PCR. Notably, expression of csgD and dtpA were controlled by OmpR regulon30,31. To determine whether G63S OmpR has any regulatory effect on these genes, we measured the expression level of these genes in &#8710;ompR/WT OmpR and &#8710;ompR/G63S OmpR strains. As shown in Fig.&#160;5, transcription of these genes was abolished in &#8710;ompR and &#8710;ompR/G63S OmpR strains, indicating that phosphorylated OmpR is indispensable for activating csgD and dtpA gene expression. csgD is a transcriptional regulator that controls curli assembly. Curli are proteinaceous fibers and their production will enhance cell-cell-interaction during biofilm formation and colonization. A mechanistic study had already demonstrated the role of ompR in curli biosynthesis32.Figure 5Transcription of (a) csgD and (b) dtpA in wild type and OmpR mutant obtained in qRT-PCR. Relative gene expressions are shown in wild type E. coli BW25113 (white column), in the absence of ompR (black column), wild type OmpR recovered in null ompR allele (hatched column), and G63S OmpR recovered in null ompR allele (grey column). Vertical error bars show the standard deviations of biological triplicates. The expression level obtained in wild type is set as reference for comparison. *P-value&#8201;<&#8201;0.05; **P-value&#8201;<&#8201;0.01; ***P-value&#8201;<&#8201;0.001.DtpA belongs to the peptide transportation family, and functions in proton-dependent transport of tripeptides33. Bacteria without dtpA gene showed a higher survival rate under treatment of antibacterial phosphonpeptide alafosfalin compared with wild type34. In order to investigate the efficiency of antibacterial peptide transportation in our transconjugants, the sizes of inhibition zones under various concentrations of alafosfalin were compared (Table&#160;2). No inhibition zone was formed by NDM-TC at a concentration of alafosfalin less than 50&#8201;mM, and a very weak inhibitory effect of alafosfalin was observed at 100&#8201;mM. The enhanced survival of NDM-TC under the treatment of alafosfalin suggested the failure of dtpA activation by G63S OmpR shut down the peptide transportation, leading to antibacterial peptide resistance. Our results indicated that mutation in ompR not only repressed porin transcription but also altered other metabolic pathways, which in turn promoted bacterial resistance including to antibiotics and antibacterial peptides.Table 2Sizes of inhibition zone of transconjugants NDM-T21a and NDM-TC under various concentrations of alafosfalin.Concentration of alafosfalin (mM)Diameter of inhibition zone (mm)NDM-T21aNDM-TC0NANA259.0&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.3NA5010.0&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.3NA10012.3&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.37.0&#8201;&#177;&#8201;1.020017.7&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.610.3&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.650020.7&#8201;&#177;&#8201;1.115.3&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.6Sizes of halo are measured with biological triplicates to determine standard deviations.NA, no inhibition zone observed.\nDiscussion\nContinuous antibiotic exposures have been shown to introduce different selective pressures on bacteria which eventually alter drug susceptibilities and even species diversities35,36. Previous studies focused on the concentration and duration of antibiotic treatment that induce bacterial resistance37,38 as well as the influence of antibiotic exposures to horizontal gene transfer, in particular their effects on bacterial conjugation15,39. Nevertheless, the combinatorial effect from both conjugation and antibiotic stimulation to the evolutionary pathway of bacteria carrying drug resistance plasmid remains unclear, provided that multiple events are commonly found in the microbial world. In this study, we set out to investigate the bacterial response under the pressure of both conjugation and antibiotic stimulation. To prevent the influence on conjugation dynamics and efficiency, exposure of various concentrations of antibiotics was conducted in the selection process rather than the mating process. Moreover, the maximum antibiotic selection dosage was similar to the highest concentration (2.8&#8201;&#181;g/mL) in patients&#8217; pleural tissues after meropenem injection40, in order to mimic the clinical setting at the hospital. According to literature, there is about 0.4&#8201;&#181;g/g of meropenem remained in the colon after 6&#8201;hours of infusion41. For urinary tract, there will be more than 1&#8201;&#181;g/mL of meropenem in the urine after 12 hours42. In our work, we found that the bacterial survival was drastically reduced under selection of higher meropenem concentration. Nevertheless, these survival clones consequently evolved into bacteria with resistance to various kinds of carbapenems. This result demonstrated that emerging antibiotic resistance is very complex and could be achieved under influence of different bacterial events such as plasmid conjugation and antibiotic selection pressure. Our study suggests that antibiotic treatment immediately after conjugation determines the evolutionary pathway of bacteria.In our transcriptomes analysis, one of the resistance mechanisms was attributed to a mutation on ompR, which represses the transcription of porins as well as other metabolic pathways. There were a few clinical reports of genetic variations on ompR9,43. This may due to additional fitness cost imposed by mutant OmpR. It was shown that deletion of ompR caused a 20% reduction in growth rate, while the ompCF double mutant only led to a 10% decline27. We also used the growth rates to compare their fitness (Fig.&#160;S7) and the doubling time of E. coli J53, NDM-T21a and NDM-TC were 33, 37 and 45&#8201;min respectively. Such reduction in fitness possibly lower bacterial survival, resulting in less frequent isolation of ompR mutants. Up till now, a few point mutations in ompR were found under long-term antibiotic selection. In particular, a G63V mutant OmpR was recently identified from an E. coli ST131 clinical isolate27,29,43, suggesting glycine 63 may be a mutation hot spot in OmpR to modulate porin expression.OmpR consists of the N-terminal regulatory and C-terminal DNA-binding domains. Genetic variation restricts the phosphorylation of the N-terminal domain of OmpR, thereby affecting the capability for DNA binding and leading to porin deficiency. A novel mutation G63S, which locates to the N-terminus of OmpR and is in close proximity to the phosphorylation site Asp-55 of OmpR (Fig.&#160;4) was identified, and its regulation to carbapenem resistance was characterized in this study. Glycine-to-serine substitution introduces one more hydroxymethyl group in the side chain of the amino acid, and this extra hydroxyl group possibly restricts the approach of EnvZ to the phosphorylation site of OmpR due to charge and steric hindrance effects. G63S OmpR fail to activate the transcription of ompC and ompF as they could not bind to their promoter region. Thus, the antibiotic influx will be reduced and the bacteria become drug resistant.We have identified several OmpR-regulons including csgD and dtpA via RNA-Seq. DtpA is a member of the tripeptide transportation system that controls the uptake of small peptides and peptidomimetics. We demonstrated that dtpA was regulated by OmpR, and a mutation in ompR reduced the influx of the antibacterial dipeptide, alafosfalin. Alafosfalin can selectively inhibit peptidoglycan biosynthesis44 and has been proposed for treating urinary tract infection45. This peptide displays promising antimicrobial properties and has been successfully utilized to isolate Salmonella from clinical samples46. Although alafosfalin is not currently prescribed for medical use, antimicrobial peptides have become a popular alternative to combat drug-resistant infections due to their broad anti-inflammatory activities and high efficiency47. Since peptide transportation is controlled by ompR, the function of peptide-based treatment may be attenuated in pathogens with mutations in ompR. The effect of peptide-based medicines in ompR or dtpA mutants remains elusive.The role of OmpR in bacterial pathogenicity is still controversial. OmpR in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium has been found to activate ssrA-ssrB, a regulatory system in Pathogenicity Island 2 that is responsible for replication inside macrophages and systematic infection in mice. Salmonella without ompR therefore fail to survive inside macrophages48. Moreover, deletion of ompR in uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) lead to a significant reduction of bacterial survival in murine bladders and kidneys49, which indicated the significance of OmpR in urinary tract infection. However, the loss of porins may also be beneficial for bacterial infection in some cases. In K. pneumoniae, loss of porins OmpK 35 and OmpK 36, homologs of OmpC and OmpF, respectively, showed different protein composition of outer membrane vesicles. These vesicles were found to induce secretion of extremely low levels of proinflammatory cytokine50. Indeed, low cytokine secretion may be an evasion mechanism for bacteria to escape from the host immune response. Since ompR is responsible for activating transcription of ompC and ompF, the ompR mutant may also produce vesicles with less proinflammatory cytokines in K. pneumoniae. The influence of ompR mutations on the protein profile of vesicles as well as their role in bacterial pathogenicity in different pathogens should be explored in the future.In summary, our findings have revealed the potential risk of bacterial conjugation combined with antibiotic exposure over a short period of time. The reduced efficiency of plasmid transfer together with the elevated MIC in survival bacterial clones dictated a more complicated mechanism of evolving antibiotic resistance in the bacteria. The identification of OmpR mutants through transcriptome analysis and their regulatory effect with respect to reduced porin expressions indicated one of the mechanistic pathways leading to carbapenem resistance of bacteria. Further understanding of OmpR-regulons obtained from RNA-Seq provided more information on the functional roles of ompR in bacterial metabolism and virulence. Our results demonstrated the influence of gene moderation by a master regulator, ompR, in various metabolic pathways, which in turn promote antimicrobial resistance.\nElectronic supplementary material\n\nNone\n\nSupplementary Information\nDataset S1.\nDataset S2.\nDataset S3.\n", "pmid": "30323356", "title": "Fine-tuning carbapenem resistance by reducing porin permeability of bacteria activated in the selection process of conjugation", "journal_title": "Scientific Reports", "authors": "Hoi-Kuan Kong;Qing Pan;Wai-U.

Chemically it is (Z)-N-{2-[({5-[(dimethylamino)methyl]furan-2-yl}methyl)sulfanyl]ethyl}-N&#8242;-methyl-2-nitroethene-1,1-diamine hydrochloride (Fig. 1).Many analytical approaches are available for the related substances of ranitidine in tablet formulations and drug substances [1&#8211;3]. A number of assay methods for determination of ranitidine in pharmaceutical formulations and human plasma is also available [4&#8211;6]. However, all the above-mentioned methods are orientated to the determination of the active pharmaceutical compound. Now-a-days, pharmaceutical industry is forced to assess a strict control of impurities when manufacturing drug substance and drug products. Determination of impurities during the development of separation methods is one of the main and difficult tasks for pharmaceutical analysts, especially if more and more impurities of closely related structure require determination. Methods are available for estimation of related substance in ranitidine with capillary electrophoresis [7, 8].To the best of our knowledge, none of the currently available analytical methods can separate all the known related compounds and degradation impurities of ranitidine hydrochloride dosage form. Attempts were made to develop a stability indicating LC method for estimation of related substance of ranitidine in liquid orals (syrups). The published Ranitidine impurity method demonstrates analysis of estimation of Ranitidine impurities in presence of placebo like saccharide and parabens with detection wavelength at 230 nm. This paper deals with the forced degradation of ranitidine syrup under stress condition like acid hydrolysis, base hydrolysis, oxidation, heat and UV light. This paper also deals with the validation of the developed method for the accurate quantification of impurities of ranitidine.\nExperimental\nThe empirical formula of Ranitidine Hydrochloride is C13H22N4O3S&#8226;HCl, representing a molecular weight of 350.87. 1 mL of ranitidine Syrup contains 16.8 mg of ranitidine HCl equivalent to 15 mg of ranitidine.\nChemicals and reagents\nSyrup and standards of ranitidine and its seven impurities namely imp-A, imp-B, imp-C, imp-D, imp-E, imp-F and imp-G (Fig. 1) were supplied by Dr. Reddy&#8217;s laboratories limited, Hyderabad, India. The HPLC grade acetonitrile, and analytical grade KH2PO4 and ortho phosphoric acid were from Merck, Darmstadt, Germany. Water was purified by a Millipore (Bedford, MA, USA) Milli-Q water-purification system and passed through a 0.22 &#956;m membrane filter (Durapore; Millipore, Dublin, Ireland) before use.\nEquipment\nThe waters HPLC PDA 2996 system used consists of a Quaternary solvent manager, a sample manager and a Photodiode array UV detector. The output signal was monitored and processed using empower software. Water baths equipped with MV controller (Julabo, Seelbach, Germany) were used for hydrolysis studies. Photo stability studies were performed in a photo stability chamber, UV light (200 watt hours / square meter), sun light (1.2 Million Lux hours) Calibrated (Sanyo, Leicestershire, UK). Thermal stability studies were performed in a dry air oven (MACK Pharmatech, Hyderabad, India).\nChromatographic Conditions\nThe analytes were separated on (100 &#215; 4.6 mm, 3 &#956;m) ACE C18 column with mobile phase containing a gradient mixture of solvent A and B at column oven temperature of 40oC with a gradient run program at a flow-rate of 1.0 mL min&#8722;1. 0.05 M potassium dihydrogen orthophosphate buffer, pH adjusted to 6.5 with orthophosphoric acid was used as buffer. Buffer and acetonitrile in 98:2 v/v ratios was used as solvent A and MilliQ water and acetonitrile in 5:95 v/v ratio was used as solvent B. The separation was achieved by gradient elution (T/%B) set as 0/0, 10/5, 25/15, 35/20, 40/55, 55/0 and 60/0. The mobile phase was filtered through a nylon membrane (pore size 0.45 &#956;m) and degassed with a helium spurge for 10 min, before use. UV detection was performed at 230 nm. The sample injection volume was 40 &#956;l.\nPreparation of Stock Solutions\nA standard stock solution (Stock A) of ranitidine (0.65 mg/mL) prepared by dissolving 72 mg Ranitidine hydrochloride of reference standard in 100 mL solvent-A. Working solutions of 32.5 &#956;g/mL (Stock-B) diluting stock-A 5.0 mL to 50 mL with solvent-A and 1.625 &#956;g/mL (Stock-C) diluting stock-B 5.0 mL to 100 mL with solvent-A were prepared for the related substance determination.The impurity stock solution was prepared by dissolving an accurately weighed amount of impurity A, imp-B, imp-C, imp-D, imp-E, imp-F and imp-G in Solvent-A, resulting in a concentration of 0.088 mg/mL (Stock-D) of (2.2 mg each impurity in 25 mL volumetric flask) of each impurity.System suitability solution containing (0.33 mg/mL) 30 mg Ranitidine and 1.76 &#956;g/mL (2 mL of Stock-D) each impurity was also prepared.\nPreparation of Sample Solution\n2 mL ranitidine syrup (equivalent to 30 mg ranitidine and 33.3mg ranitidine HCl.) was transferred to a 100 mL volumetric flask, 50 mL solvent A was added. The mixture was then sonicated for 10 minute and diluted to volume to give a solution containing 300 &#956;g/mL. The above solution was centrifuged at 4000rpm for 10 minutes in order to eliminate insoluble excipients. This solution was filtered through a 0.45 &#956;m pore size Nylon 66 membrane filter and inject in HPLC system as per chromatographic conditions mention in section 2.3.\nMethod Validation\nThe proposed method was validated as per ICH guidelines [9].\nSpecificity\nSpecificity is the ability of the method to measure the analyte response in the presence of its potential impurities. A study was conducted to demonstrate the effective separation of Ranitidine Hydrochloride and its impurities. Also study was intended to ensure the effective separation of degradation peaks of formulation ingredients at the retention time of Ranitidine Hydrochloride and its impurities. Separate portions of drug product and ingredients were exposed to following stress conditions to induce degradation.The drug product was subjected to base hydrolysis using 0.1 N Sodium hydroxide, acid hydrolysis with 0.1N Hydrochloric acid for duration of 30 minute. Oxidation study was performed with 0.1 % Hydrogen Peroxide solution at room temperature for 30 minute. On photo stability study, drug product was sufficiently spread on Petri plates (1 mm thick layer), exposed to sunlight and UV light (200 watt hours / square meter), sun light (1.2 Million Lux hours) at ambient conditions for 10 days. Humidity study was performed separately by exposing the drug product to humidity at 25&#176;C, 90% RH for 7 days. Thermal degradation study was performed by heating drug product at 60&#176; C for 10 days. Similarly placebo samples were prepared as like as drug product by exposing formulation matrices without drug substance.Peak purity test was carried out for the ranitidine peak by using PDA detector in stress samples.\nPrecision\nThe precision of the related substance method was checked by injecting six individual preparations of ranitidine (0.3 mg/mL) spiked with 0.50% of imp-A, imp-B, imp-C, imp-D, imp-E, imp-F and imp-G with respect to ranitidine analyte concentration. % R.S.D. of area for each imp-A, imp-B, imp-C, imp-D, imp-E, imp-F and imp-G was calculated.The intermediate precision of the method was also evaluated using different analyst and different instrument in the same laboratory.\nLimits of Detection (LOD) and Quantification (LOQ)\nThe LOD and LOQ for imp-A, imp-B, imp-C, imp-D, imp-E, imp-F and imp-G were determined at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3:1 and 10:1, respectively, by injecting a series of dilute solutions with known concentrations. LOD and LOQ were experimentally verified by injecting six replicate injection of each impurity at the concentration obtained from above values.\nLinearity\nA series of solutions of Ranitidine impurities in the concentration ranging from limit of quantification level to 300% of standard concentration were prepared and injected into the HPLC system. Correlation coefficient Value for the slope and Y-intercept of the calibration curve was calculated.\nAccuracy\nTo confirm the accuracy of the proposed method, recovery studies were carried out by standard addition technique. The accuracy study of impurities were carried out in triplicate at LOQ, 50%, 100%, 150%, 200% and 300% of the target concentration level 0.5% of ranitidine analyte concentration (300 &#956;g/mL). The percentages of recoveries for impurities were calculated.\nRobustness\nTo determine the robustness of the developed method, experimental conditions were deliberately altered and the resolution between ranitidine imp-A, imp-B, imp-C, imp-D, imp-E, imp-F and imp-G was recorded. The flow rate of the mobile phase was 1.0 mL/min. To study the effect of flow rate on the resolution, flow was changed by 0.2 units from 0.8 to 1.2 mL/min. The effect of the column temperature on resolution was studied at 35&#176; and 43&#176; C instead of 40&#176; C. The effect of the percent organic strength on resolution was studied by varying acetonitrile by &#8722;10% +10%. While other mobile phase components was held constant as stated in Section 2.3.\nSolution Stability and Mobile Phase Stability\nThe solution stability of ranitidine and its impurities in the related substance method was carried out by leaving spiked sample solutions in tightly capped volumetric flasks at room temperature for 48 hours. Content of ranitidine imp-A, imp-B, imp-C, imp-D, imp-E, imp-F and imp-G were determined for every 24 hours interval up to the study period. The mobile phase stability was also carried out for 48 hours by injecting the freshly prepared sample solutions for every 24 hours interval. Content of ranitidine imp-A, imp-B, imp-C, imp-D, imp-E, imp-F and imp-G were checked in the test.\nResults and Discussion\n\nMethod Development and Optimization\nThe main criteria for development of a successful HPLC method for determination of Ranitidine HCl and its related Substances in oral solution were: the method should be able to determine all substances in a single run and should be accurate, reproducible, robust, stability indicating, free of interference from blank / placebo / impurities / degradation products and straightforward enough for routine use in quality control laboratory.The main objective of the chromatographic method was to achieve good resolution between critical closely eluting pair ranitidine impurity-D and impurity-E, to well resolve impurity-C peak from placebo peak, and to find Symmetrical peak shape of Ranitidine Hydrochloride and its Impurities. To elute parabens peaks, a gradient elution with 95 % acetonitrile in the solvent B has been selected. In order to achieve symmetrical peak of Ranitidine Hydrochloride and its Impurity and more resolution between impurity-D and impurity-E, stationary phases like C18 (different brand), ACE C18 250 &#215; 4.6, 5&#956; column, Xterra RP 18 100 &#215; 4.6 mm, 5&#956;, Xterra RP18 100 &#215; 4.6, 3.5&#956; (Fig. 2) were studied but good resolution has achieved with ACE C18 100 &#215; 4.6, 3&#956; column (Fig. 3). The flow rate of 1.0 mL/min was selected with regards to the backpressure and analysis time as well. Column oven temperature is also studied (50&#176;C and 40&#176;C) and found that 40&#176;C temperature is more appropriate with respect to resolution and peak shape (Fig. 2).Attempts were also made with gradient elution with solvents A and B (Section 2.3) using pH 6.8 buffer conditions, the resolution between impurity C and placebo peak was decreased (Fig. 2).It was found that use of buffer prepared by adjusting the pH of 0.05M potassium dihydrogen phosphate to 6.5 (PKa of Ranitidine is 8.2) with orthophosphoric acid (solvent A: buffer, acetonitrile in the ratio 98:2, v/v and solvent B: Milli Q water, acetonitrile in the ratio 5:95, v/v) with column temperature was maintained at 40&#176; C and gradient elution (T/%B) was set as 0/0, 10/5, 25/15, 35/20, 40/55, 55/0 and 60/0 gives enabled separation for all pair compounds and eluted Ranitidine as a symmetrical peak (Fig. 3 and table 1). No interfering peaks were observed in blank & placebo, indicating that signal suppression or enhancement by the product matrices was negligible (Fig. 3).The empirical formula of Ranitidine Hydrochloride is C13H22N4O3S&#8226;HCl, representing a molecular weight of 350.87. Each 1 mL of ranitidine Syrup contains 16.8 mg of ranitidine HCl equivalent to 15 mg of ranitidine.\nValidation of the Method\n\nSystem Suitability\nSystem suitability parameters were measured so as to verify the system, method and column performance. Results of other system suitability parameters such as relative retention time of each impurity, resolution between Impurity E and Impurity D, tailing factor and similarity factor (between two standard preparations) are presented in table 1. As seen from this data, the acceptable system suitability parameters would be: relative retention time of each impurity should comparable, resolution between Impurity E and Impurity D is not less than 1.5, Tailing factor for Ranitidine peak in standard solution is not more than 2.0, similarity factor (between two standard preparations) is not less than 0.98 and not more than 1.02.

Linear calibration plot for the related substance method was obtained over the calibration ranges tested, i.e. LOQ to 300 % for impurity imp-A, imp-B, imp-C, imp-D, imp-E, imp-F and imp-G. The correlation coefficient obtained was greater than 0.997 (table 3). The above result show that an excellent correlation existed between the peak area and the concentration of imp-A, imp-B, imp-C, imp-D, imp-E, imp-F and imp-G.\nAccuracy\nThe percentage recovery of impurities in ranitidine samples varied from 90 to 110 % at LOQ, 50%, 100%, 150%, 200% and 300 % levels of target 0.5 % level.

Introduction\nThe Chernobyl disaster that happened in 1986 remains a significant medical and social problem [1&#8211;4]. Despite the fact that most of the clean-up workers, involved in the elimination of Chernobyl disaster consequences, were exposed to low doses of radiation (usually not exceeding 0,25&#8201;Gy, registered by personal dosimeters), at the early stage it was revealed that they have different polymorphic symptoms with combination of asthenic, psychovegetative, and subaffective disorders, at first with mild, neurodynamic, and reversible cognitive disorders, developing later into a psychoorganic syndrome, based on the early cerebrovascular pathology, as well as neuroendocrine, neurological, immune, and psychosomatic disturbances. The polymorphism of the disorders, detected among these patients, and also the fact that they did not have any form of radiation disease made it difficult to interpret them in one strict way and showed the probable multifactorial genesis of these disorders. Among them are extreme conditions of work, sleep irregularity, radioactive fallouts, thrown during the first month of catastrophe, combustion products, toxic elements in decontamination agents and burning of different materials, and also exhalation of boron and lead (sand, containing lead and boron, was strewed into destroyed reactor). Psychological factors may also have been involved, but they seemed to have secondary influence, as PTSD in typical form was not observed in this cohort of patients. The symptomatology did not meet any form of radiation disease. From the beginning we had doubts in the very often categorization of polymorphous clinical symptomatology in clean-up workers as the specific of PTSD, with a projection of fear to &#8220;invisible threat.&#8221; That interpretation of the nature of the clinical conditions in clean-up workers is usually proposed by psychologists [4&#8211;6]. It was quite obvious, as clean-up workers did not have any flashbacks, which are the core symptoms of PTSD, or nightmares, that they did not develop distinct depressive symptoms (just mild subdepressive fluctuations) and were rather socialized at that period of time.Our clinical experience and traditional approaches allowed us to identify the states, observed in this cohort, as psychoorganic syndrome, the term which is almost forgotten but shows most accurately the entire spectrum of the disorders revealed. The notion of psychoorganic syndrome was coined by Bleuler in 1916 and 1923 [7] and developed by Walther-B&#252;el [8]. It includes the memory and attention impairments (up to difficulties in cognition), combined with affective and vegetative instability.Psychoorganic syndrome was presented by mild, nondement forms and was mostly caused by an early atherosclerosis and brain vessels angiopathy, caused by hypertension. The structure of this syndrome is presented by 4 main symptom-complexes, asthenic, psychovegetative, dysthymic, and cognitive, and the syndrome develops from early, asthenic or psychovegetative variants, which includes severe headaches, tiredness, irritability, blood pressure fluctuations, and sleep disorders, to the more severe dysthymic variant, and then turns into predement, cognitive deficit form with decreasing intellectual productivity, which does not seem to reverse after the treatment.Moscow Research Institute of Psychiatry has been involved in health investigation and treatment of Chernobyl clean-up workers. From 1990 till nowadays these patients are treated in our clinic every year (some do twice a year) and receive vasotropic and cerebroprotective therapy, as well as psychosocial therapy, group therapy, and cognitive training. During the course of treatment they are examined by different specialists: therapists, neurologists, ophthalmologists, and endocrinologists. From 1990 to 2014 this cohort of patients, observed and treated at least during 5 consecutive years, achieved 663 patients (the whole number of investigated clean-workers counted 1750). Additionally we often provide consultative assistance to the offsprings of the Chernobyl clean-up workers as part of the family therapy. During the last 5 years the cohort has changed, as several patients died mostly from stroke or heart infarction, cancers or did not enter the cohort by other reasons, and the new patients, who never received regular vasotropic and/or cerebroprotective therapy, have joined. For analysis in this paper we limited the sample to 312 patients which came to our clinic for repeated hospital treatment in the last 5 years. Comparing results of the therapy of patients of this sample with previous therapy results would be incorrect, mostly due to the differences in age. In this paper the results of long-term 5-year prospective study are presented.\n2. Material and Methods\n312 male rescue workers were observed in Moscow Research Institute of Psychiatry from 2009 to 2014. The age of patients varied from 45 to 70 years (the average age 57,0 &#177; 6,8). The radiation doses usually did not exceed 0,25&#8201;Gy. All of the patients were diagnosed with psychoorganic syndrome, confirmed by clinical, neuropsychological, and instrumental examination. Anamnesis and the level of social adaptation were also estimated. Clinical estimation was done by the use of specially developed Clinical Psychopathological Chart [1, 2], Hamilton Depression Scale (HDRS-17), and Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HARS). Neuropsychological part included tests on working memory, attention, and abstract thinking. Instrumental examination included brain MRI and Doppler ultrasound. We did only routine blood tests. Cytological blood tests of clean-up workers were done in another research centre. In some cases they revealed certain aberrations. The assessment of cognitive training effectiveness, comparing before and after treatment, was carried out. Pharmacological treatment was based on vasotropic and cerebroprotective remedies, used intravenously. Statistical data analysis was done with the use of nonparametric tests.\n3. Results\nAll the patients were diagnosed with mild, nondement form of psychoorganic syndrome, which included 4 main groups of symptoms: asthenic (permanent headaches, tiredness, irritability, hypothymic reactions, and hyperesthesia), psychovegetative (sleep disorders, permanent or paroxysmal vegetative disorders, paresthesia, algia and other somatoform disorders, low-grade fever, blood pressure fluctuations, etc.), dysthymic (mild dysthymic-dysphoric or anxious-dysphoric depressions usually with inverted circadian status rhythmicity and hyperesthesia), and cognitive (working memory impairments, decreased productivity, and lack of abstract thinking). Nondement cognitive disorders fall under the concept of &#8220;disexecutive syndrome,&#8221; which includes lack of voluntary attention and initiation, poor planning and outcome control, lack of cognitive flexibility with poor ability to suppress interfering influences, and working memory impairment [9, 10]. In neuropsychological concept all cognitive impairments, observed in this cohort, can be combined in 3 syndromes: diencephalic, diencephalic-right-hemispheric, and diencephalic-frontal (by conception of [11]).Before assay results it is important to estimate factors, which determined the development of psychoorganic syndrome in clean-up workers cohort, for better understanding of its triggers and pathogenesis. Those clean-up workers, who did not reveal any mental disorders, were the control group (44 patients). The data is presented in Figure 1.The most significant factor, which influenced the pathogenesis of psychoorganic syndrome, was the primary radiation reaction (statistically significant difference with control group is shown). It included dyspeptic disorders, nausea, tiredness, dizziness, taste and olfactory disorders, and body temperature fluctuations. Primary radiation reaction, with the other factors, could be a trigger for further development of early vascular pathology and further psychoorganic disorders, associated with it.Neuropathic constitution in childhood, which includes enuresis, ticks, and stammering, was also involved in pathogenesis. These features were mentioned in 19,1% of patients in main group and 2,3% in control group (P < 0,01). Neuropathic constitution is not pathology, but it can reduce compensatory abilities and make an unfavourable background for further disorders.Various exogenous factors before accident, including mild brain injuries and inflammations, were also analysed. As it is mentioned in Figure 1, these factors were observed to be much more frequent in main group than in control group (P < 0,05). The more significant difference is shown in additional exogenous factors during accident. They included harmful toxic elements in decontamination substances, exhalation of boron and lead, combustion products, and extreme conditions of work. Statistical data show significant differences between main and control group (P < 0,05).The clean-up workers were exposed to different exogenous factors after an accident too, such as brain trauma, inflammatory diseases, and alcohol abuse, which have also influenced the conditions. The difference between main and control group was statistically significant (P  0,05).These findings indicate predominantly multiple etiology and complex pathogenesis of these disorders, as evidenced by its polymorphism. Polymorphic disorders, as well as somatic and neurological diseases, diagnosed in these patients, require special therapeutic approaches.The comparative therapeutic 5-year study was carried out with the use of 4 vasotropic remedies and cerebroprotectors: cerebrolysin, vinpocetine (cavinton), actovegin, and picamilon (Table 1).The received data show significant improvements in the health status of patients, with the most notable results in cerebrolysin group (Figure 2). It is important to mention that cerebrolysin had positive impact not only on asthenic and psychovegetative symptom-complex, but on the level of dysthymic disorders (P < 0,01) and cognitive functions as well (P < 0,05). Other remedies also reduced asthenic, psychovegetative, and dysthymic disorders, and the most effective results were identified in actovegin group (Figure 3); significant reduction of asthenic and psychovegetative disorders was mentioned in vinpocetine and picamilon group, with no statistically significant improvements in dysthymic and cognitive complex (Figures 4 and 5).The therapy of this cohort of patients also included psychosocial work, art therapy, family therapy, and cognitive training. The analysis of results is represented in 2 main groups: patients with predominant asthenic, psychovegetative, or dysthymic disorders and patients with predominant cognitive impairment (Figure 6). Both groups showed reduction of cognitive disorders after the training course, but patients with more severe cognitive impairment improved their cognitive skills markedly less.The verification of cerebrovascular pathology and assessment of the brain damage level was carried out with the use of brain MRI and Doppler ultrasound. It is important to mention severe, predominantly diffuse changes in brain in all the patients of this cohort, with the high frequency of leukoaraiosis, despite relatively low expression of these changes. The level of leukoaraiosis correlated with the severity of the psychopathological disorders, estimated by the clinical chart (r = 0,41, P < 0,05).The data analysis of variance showed a statistically significant dependence of internal hydrocephalus from prevailing clinical symptoms (F = 2.75; P < 0,05).It should be also noted that the morphology of congenital disorders of the brain acquired anatomical features of the brain tissue and changes in the pituitary gland are rare finds and occur in isolated cases.The evaluation of Doppler ultrasound results showed that the level of blood flow in cerebrovascular system was characterized by rather frequent occurrence (80%) and mild to moderate circulatory disorders. There were no severe pathologies, but presented disorders were characterized by damage in both carotid and vertebral-basilar arteries and venous portion of the vascular system.Noteworthy is prevalence of impaired blood flow rate in the system of the carotid arteries, especially in its extracranial branches (85%), as well as the involvement of the arterial system in the pathological process at its intracranial level (64%), indicating the active involvement of compensatory mechanisms in the regulation of brain blood supply. In 87% of cases difficulty in venous outflow was noted.In our earlier papers the diffuse brain lesions were detected by the data of SPECT (single photon emission tomography) [1, 2]. Our data regarding early vascular pathology coincides with results of studies by neurologists [12&#8211;15].\n4. Conclusions\nPolymorphic disorders in clean-up workers cohort, which fit into the concept of psychoorganic syndrome, are based on multifactorial etiology and specific pathogenesis, with the influence of biological, psychological, and social factors. The complex of these factors leads to early cerebrovascular pathology that manifests a variety of symptom-complexes, with the core symptom-complex of cognitive impairment. Regular treatment, which includes stationary annual courses with vasotropic and cerebroprotective remedies, as well as psychosocial work, including family therapy, group therapy, and cognitive training, can significantly reduce symptoms of disease and improve volitional resources, which is the most reasonable approach, as it contributes to personality preservation and improves social adaptation of patients.", "pmid": "25692150", "title": "Early Aging in Chernobyl Clean-Up Workers: Long-Term Study", "journal_title": "BioMed Research International", "authors": "V.

The association of posterior fossa lesions with syringomyelia has been described occasionally both for solid and cystic pathologies414). Few cystic lesions of posterior fossa have been found in association with syringomyelia, and even fewer have been reported in the huge retrocerebellar arachnoid cysts associated with syringomyelia918). In the majority of these cases, development of syringomyelia was related to obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow caused by a downward invagination of the cyst itself or tonsillar decent within the foramen magnum1113). The clinical features of syringomyelia are highly variable, usually with an insidious onset, a course that lasts for many years, and an unpredictable pace of progression19). Multiple treatment options for retrocerebellar arachnoid cysts have been introduced including cyst fenestration, cyst-peritoneal shunting, and foramen magnum decompression with complete or partial excision1415). We describe the case of a patient with a huge retrocerebellar cyst associated with CSF flow impairment in the foramen magnum and the resulting in syringomyelia.\nCASE REPORT\nA 29-year-old man was brought into the clinic following a complaint of dizziness, gait disturbance, and shock-like pain occurring in both shoulders over the course of several months. Upon neurological examination, the patient was fully conscious, and functioning of the cranial nerve was within the normal range. Motor power was preserved in all four limbs, but paresthesia on the left side of the upper limb was noted. Deep tendon reflexes were increased and abnormal reflexes (e.g., Hoffman sign, ankle clonus) were present. The rest of the examination was unremarkable. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a large cystic mass at the posterior fossa with compression of the 4th ventricle and the brain stem with extension into the foramen magnum, which resulted in syringomyelia occurring from C1 to T10 and a mild dilatation of the lateral and the 3rd ventricle (Fig. 1A). Cine MRI revealed that the flow of CSF was present below only the foramen magnum(Fig. 2A). The patient underwent a suboccipital craniotomy and C1 laminectomy with the removal of the arachnoid cyst's walls. The dura mater was closed with a dural graft. Histopathological analysis of the excised tissues showed flattening of meningothelial cells attached to a loose fibrous wall with normal vessels (Fig. 3). Postoperative MRI revealed a residual cyst, but the size and extent of syringomyelia had decreased (Fig. 1B). In addition, CSF flow was improved on cine MRI (Fig. 2B) and clinically, the patient's symptoms were markedly improved.\nDISCUSSION\nArachnoid cysts are benign intra-arachnoid fluid collections that develop as the result of an abnormal duplication of the arachnoid membranes during brain development. In patients with arachnoid cysts, neurological signs and symptoms reflect cyst size, anatomic distribution, and its impact on CSF flow. Arachnoid cysts account for approximately 1% of all intracranial mass lesions3). Posterior fossa arachnoid cysts represent roughly one fourth of all these congenital pouches. There have been several other reports that have noted large arachnoid cysts associated with syringomyelia918).Syringomyelia is associated with many intracranial and spinal anomalies5). One study postulated that syringomyelia results from obstruction of CSF flow at the foramen magnum and the outlet of the fourth ventricle2). Obstruction of CSF flow may lead to an increased pulsatile pressure within the spinal canal and forcing CSF into the spinal cord17). Most posterior fossa arachnoid cysts result in cerebellar tonsillar herniation, consequently leading to compression of the spinal cord and syringomyelia resulting from the presence of the mass. The socalled \"acquired\" Chiari malformation (CM) seems to be better understood. Oldfield et al.16) propose that the descended tonsils obstruct the CSF flow to and from the spinal compartment at the foramen magnum thus explaining the appearance of syringomyelia.However, as in our case it is extremely rare for a huge retrocerebellar arachnoid cyst at the foramen magnum to directly compress the spinal cord and result in syringomyelia. Martinez-Lage et al.12) identified 15 published cases of syringomyelia accompanying diverse cystic processes of the posterior fossa, such as congenital arachnoid cysts, Dandy-Walker malformation, Blake's pouch cyst, and posttraumatic CSF pouches. In 14 of those cases, the obstruction of normal CSF flow through the foramen magnum was due to blockage by the walls of the cyst itself. In all these cases, there was a coexistent syringomyelia. Jain et al.8) documented one case of a giant posterior fossa arachnoid cyst extending into and compressing the spinal cord and resulting in syringomyelia. Kiran et al.10) also reported such a case.Many patients with large posterior fossa lesions may have associated syringomyelia but no symptoms related to the syringomyelia. Thus, it is important to image the entire length of spine in all the patients presenting with posterior fossa mass lesions. Clinical manifestations of CM-1 malformation and syringomyelia associated with posterior fossa arachnoid cysts involved in foramen magnum obstruction are head and neck pain, retroocular pain, cerebellar signs, cranial nerve dysfunction, sleep apnea, and respiratory difficulty. Furthermore, patients presenting with spinal cord compression may show a loss of fine movements, dysesthesia, dissociated sensory loss, sensory level, spasticity, scoliosis, or sphincter disturbances6).Various surgical options exist for the treatment of retrocerebellar arachnoid cyst according to the underlying pathogenic mechanism, including cyst fenestration, cyst-peritoneal shunting, and foramen magnum decompression with complete or partial excision1415). Removal of the underlying pathology and stablishing the normal CSF flow at the foramen magnum is the main stay of treatment for syringomyelia9). For cases of foramen magnum arachnoid cyst with direct compression of the spinal cord and syringomyelia, excision should be performed as much as possible with complete decompression of the posterior fossa, which should result in a satisfying outcome even if the arachnoid cyst is unable to be completely excised7).We report here a case of patient who received decompression of the posterior fossa with a partial cyst excision, which markedly improved his symptoms. Even though the post-ope rative MRI showed a residual cyst, there was a reduction in the syrinx size. We feel that the surgical management of a huge retrocerebellar arachnoid cyst itself is attributed to syringomyelia, fenestration of the cyst and expansion of the fora men magnum, leading to restoration of the CSF pathway. In addition, suboccipital craniotomy, with open cyst removal, offers the opportunity to explore the lesions and to relieve any arachnoid adhesions that may further restrict CSF flow.\nCONCLUSION\nWe present a case report of a huge retrocerebellar arachnoid cyst with syringomyelia. Our patient's symptoms markedly improved after suboccipital craniotomy and C1 laminectomy with the partial removal of the arachnoid cyst's walls. We briefly reviewed previous cases of syringomyelia associated with posterior fossa cysts. In this as in other types of posterior fossa lesions associated with syringomyelia, we recommend that the surgical management be used to address underlying hypothetical mechanism.", "pmid": "26512273", "title": "Syringomyelia Associated with a Huge Retrocerebellar Arachnoid Cyst: A Case Report", "journal_title": "Korean Journal of Spine", "authors": "Sung Baek Hue;Han Yu Seong;Soon Chan Kwon;In Uk Lyo;Hong Bo Sim", "doi": "10.14245/kjs.2015.12.3.156", "score": "0.0063703214"}, {"keywords": "", "abstract": "Introduction: The sternalis is a rare (strap-like) parasternal muscle that is well known to anatomists, but relatively unknown to clinicians, including surgeons.

The patient desires removal of the keloids. Hence, a decision was made to excise the keloids, followed by immediate reconstruction with a propeller flap (Figs 1&#8212;3).Intraoperative excision of the keloids and undermining of adjacent subcutaneous tissue revealed chest muscle fibers fitting the description of the sternalis muscle (Fig 4). The left parasternal muscle measures about 5 to 6 cm and appears to originate from the intraclavicular region (further dissection was not indicated) with insertion in the region where the left abdominal rectus sheath, left external oblique aponeurosis, and lower ribs margin converge. Tendon at the origin appears to be contiguous with tendon of the sternocleidomastoid muscle.The patient tolerated the procedure without any complications (Fig 5). He also underwent postoperative therapeutic radiation to help prevent keloid recurrence. Peripostoperative follow-up visit revealed a well-healed scar with mile erythema along the wound-edge union (Fig 6). There were no signs or symptoms of infection.\nDISCUSSION\nTo summarize, the sternalis muscle is a rare, superficial chest wall muscle that is inadequately described in standard anatomical texts. Although well known to trained anatomists, the muscle is relatively unknown to surgeons and other clinicians.2 The advent of radiographic tools has brought renewed interest in the muscle outside anatomical communities. More recently, intraoperative encounter of the muscle has been described7-9 and its utilization (when available) for chest wall reconstruction has been suggested.7,10,11 Only 1 case, in which the sternalis is employed for reconstruction (of the breast, in conjunction with a tissue expander), has been reported.12 Therefore, familiarity of the sternalis muscle not only broadens the surgeon's knowledge of variations of chest wall anatomy but also provides reconstructive options (when present) for wounds in the chest wall as well as adjacent regions.As aforementioned, the sternalis is a parasternal, strap-like muscle with variable morphology and unclear embryonic origin. According to Jelev et al,4 the sternalis (1) lies between the anterior thoracic superficial fascia and the pectoral fascia, (2) originates in the intraclavicular region or sternum, and (3) inserts onto the rectus sheath, costal cartilages, lower ribs, or external oblique aponeurosis. The muscle is innervated by branches of the internal/external thoracic nerve and/or branches of the intercostal nerves. The muscle's function (help elevate the lower chest wall) is insignificant; therefore, it can be sacrificed for reconstruction. The internal thoracic artery provides blood supply to the muscle.The sternalis muscle can be uni- or bilateral and may have 1 or 2 bellies.4 In instances when the muscle has 2 bellies, the major belly is always parasternal, whereas the minor belly can be found either parallel or orthogonal to the major belly (with bifurcation about the origin). It important to note that, although the belly and the origin are typically ipsilateral, contralateral orientation is also found. Presence of the sternalis is associated with partial absence of the ipsilateral (subjacent) pectoralis muscle.Currently, there is great debate surrounding the embryologic origin of the sternalis muscle.1,13 This, in part, is due to variations of muscle morphology in postnatal encounters. It is thought that the sternalis may represent remnants of the panniculus carnosus.5,14 However, the muscle may also be a derivative of a primitive ventral-longitudinal muscle sheet that gives rise to the sternocleidomastoid and the rectus abdominis muscles.15 This would explain why tendon/fascial fibers of the sternalis are oftentimes contiguous with those of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and/or the rectus abdominis muscle. In even rarer cases, where the minor belly is perpendicular to the major belly, incomplete fusion with the pectoralis during prenatal development may be the explanation.1 Still, it is entirely possible that the muscle is derived from multiple sources.16Irrespective of how the sternalis muscle is derived, it is important to be acquainted with its existence in order to avoid potential confusion when incidentally encountered. Moreover, when its presence is radiographically confirmed, in the setting of reconstructive potential (such as existing regional soft tissue defect), surgeons may elect to harvest the muscle for reconstructive use; sacrificing such &#8220;insignificant&#8221; muscle is always preferred over harvesting part of a more important functional muscle.Not enough is known about the sternalis muscle to draw any conclusion about its utility in reconstructive surgery. It is hoped that cases will be presented in the foreseeable future describing its usage in reconstruction of the neck, chest, abdomen, and perhaps even other places.", "pmid": "22893785", "title": "The Sternalis Muscle&#8212;Incidental Finding of a Rare Chest Wall Muscle Variant During Keloid Excision-Chest Wall Reconstruction", "journal_title": "Eplasty", "authors": "Dinh T.

In addition, NMD is involved in post-transcriptional regulation of global gene expression2. PTC-introducing variants cause human genetic diseases3, making NMD an important modulator of disease outcome. In particular, NMD can both protect against disease4 and aggravate disease phenotypes5. Therefore, a complete understanding about how the NMD machinery selects which transcripts to degrade is crucial for predicting the phenotypic consequences of nonsense mutations in humans.The canonical model for how PTC-containing transcripts are recognized in mammalian cells is the exon junction complex (EJC) model, which was defined by introducing PTCs into reporter genes6,7. EJC proteins are deposited at exon-exon junctions by the splicing machinery but, after nuclear export, are stripped off mRNAs by the translating ribosome. If a PTC is present at least 50 nucleotides (nt) upstream of the last exon junction, an EJC will remain bound after the pioneering round of translation has terminated8. The interaction between termination factors and the downstream EJC subsequently triggers NMD9.While the EJC model is well supported, exceptions have been reported10,11,12, highlighting the possible relevance of an alternative &#8220;faux 3&#8242; UTR&#8221; model for mammalian cells. This model was originally defined in yeast, where a very long 3&#8242; UTR triggers NMD13,14, and also applies to Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans15,16. One further exception to the canonical EJC model has been observed with individual examples of human genes bearing PTCs close to the start codon, rendering them insensitive to NMD17,18, even with downstream EJCs present. It was hypothesized that 5&#8242; proximal PTCs circumvent NMD by re-initiating translation downstream, or, alternatively, that the proximity to poly(A) binding protein in a closed mRNA loop inhibits NMD17,19. It is not clear how widely these exceptions from the canonical EJC model apply beyond the few transcripts in which they were discovered.To systematically test the general validity of these proposed rules for NMD efficiency and to discover new NMD rules requires a global and unbiased approach. A recent study examined the effects of germline protein-truncating variants from 635 individuals on allele-specific mRNA expression20, providing support for the canonical EJC model but suggesting additional rules are also likely to be important21. We hypothesized that human cancer genomes and their matched transcriptomes are a useful resource to discover and test these additional rules. Cancer exomes can, in some instances, harbor hundreds of somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs), including new PTCs, most of which are passenger mutations with little consequence for the tumor cells22. Here we systematically elucidate the rules governing NMD in human cells using the nonsense variants from nearly 10,000 human tumors and are able to explain ~3/4 of the non-random variance in NMD efficiency. Applying the model identifies both positive and negative selection on NMD-inducing somatic mutations in human tumors and provides a classification of human tumor suppressor genes.\nResults\nTo systematically examine determinants of NMD efficiency we compiled a dataset of somatic nonsense mutations from 9,769 cancer patients with available exome sequences, copy number alteration (CNA) and mRNA expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (Fig. 1). We considered 27 cancer types separately (Supplementary Fig. 1b), further subdividing them into 94 subtypes by clustering based on global gene expression patterns (Methods). The NMD efficiency of each nonsense mutation was estimated as the fold-change in mRNA expression level compared to the median expression of wild-type transcripts of the same gene in the same cancer subtype (Supplementary Fig. 1a). We applied stringent filters to ensure absence of CNA, high frequency of the somatic variants in each tumor, high expression levels and low variation of the wild-type gene across samples (Methods). This resulted in 2,840 high-confidence nonsense mutations with NMD efficiency estimates in 1,900 different genes originating from 1,271 patients (median = 1 nonsense mutation per patient, 25 patients with >10 nonsense mutations).We validated our findings in two additional data sets (Fig. 1): somatic small indels that result in a downstream out-of-frame PTC in the TCGA tumor samples (3,151 indel-induced PTCs in 1,957 genes from 1,156 patients after filtering) and heterozygous germline nonsense variants in 452 lymphoblastoid cell lines from the Geuvadis study20 where the NMD efficiency was quantified as allele-specific mRNA expression of the reference over the variant allele21 (1,784 high-confidence PTCs in 487 unique loci after filtering on read counts).\nThe standard EJC-model applies widely to human genes\nThe EJC-model postulates that translation termination at least 50 nt upstream of an exon junction triggers NMD6,7. Comparing the NMD-efficiency of PTCs located upstream of the last EJC versus PTCs inside the last exon (Fig. 2b,e; Supplementary Fig. 1c,d) shows that NMD is, overall, indeed inefficient in the latter case (1.7% vs. 84.7% NMD efficiency &#8211; calculated as observed NMD efficiency over maximum observable NMD efficiency using our NMD model (Methods), p < 2.2 &#215; 10&#8211;16). We also observe a sharp decrease towards a complete NMD insensitivity over the 50 nt boundary upstream of the last exon, demarcating the physical location of the EJC (2.2% vs. 84.7% NMD efficiency, p = 5.3 &#215; 10&#8211;5). Thus, a downstream EJC is a widespread signal for efficient NMD in many human genes. Consistently, intronless transcripts that bear PTCs are not degraded by NMD (Supplementary Fig. 1f), as expected from their lack of deposited EJCs.Next, we examined whether the yeast/Drosophila &#8220;faux 3&#8242; UTR&#8221; model11&#8211;14 also applies to human cells, meaning that a long 3&#8242; UTR would be sufficient to trigger NMD even in the absence of EJCs. When examining PTCs located downstream of the last exon junction or in intronless genes we did not observe a correlation of NMD efficiency to PTC proximity to the transcript 3&#8242; end (Supplementary Fig. 1e,f, p = 0.92, t-test for significance of Pearson R). This conclusion is also upheld when using frameshift-inducing indels in TCGA or germline truncation variants (Supplementary Fig. 1g,h, p > 0.54). Thus, while faux 3&#8242; UTR-related mechanisms may be important in individual cases23,24, they do not appear to be a prevalent influence on NMD efficiency in human cells. Consistently, a study in HeLa cells did not observe a relationship between transcript 3&#8242; UTR length and mRNA turnover rates in transcripts targeted by the key NMD factor UPF125.However, transcripts harboring an intron within the 3&#8242; UTR show a different trend, where PTCs in the second-last exon do not trigger NMD despite the presence of a downstream exon junction (7% efficient NMD for PTCs in penultimate exon vs. 81% in the upstream exons, p = 0.045; 12% vs. 81% for frameshift indels, p = 0.006; Fig. 2c,e, Supplementary Fig. 2a). This suggests that EJCs in 3&#8242;UTRs are generally less capable of interacting with the termination machinery to initiate NMD, and the NMD-triggering EJC appears to be the one located at the second-last splice site.\nStart-proximal PTCs avoid NMD by reinitiating translation\nPreviously, PTCs introduced into the first half of exon 1 of the &#946;-globin gene were shown not to reduce mRNA abundance18, suggesting that the NMD machinery did not recognize these transcripts. Our cancer genome data support the generality of this result, with a widespread decrease in NMD efficiency when PTCs are located in close proximity to the start codon (Fig. 2d,e, 35% vs. 93% NMD efficiency for PTCs within 200 nt of the start codon vs. >200 nt from the start codon, p < 2.2 &#215; 10&#8211;16; Supplementary Fig. 2b,c). PTCs located in the first 100 coding nts are rarely targeted for NMD, followed by a gradual increase in NMD efficiency up to 200 nt from the start codon (Fig. 2d,e). This start-proximal NMD insensitivity is not explained by the canonical EJC model of NMD because the downstream EJCs fail to trigger NMD. The same conclusion is reached analyzing somatic frameshift data (Supplementary Fig. 2b, p = 5.5 &#215; 10&#8211;12) and allele-specific expression of germline variants (Supplementary Fig. 2c, p = 0.0001). Two mechanisms have been proposed to account for the examples of NMD insensitivity in transcripts with start-proximal PTCs: transcript stabilization by an interaction between the poly(A) binding protein C1 (PABPC1) and the translation termination machinery19 or a bypass of NMD by the re-initiation of translation at a downstream AUG codon17.Comparing the reading frame of the first AUG downstream from the PTCs shows NMD insensitivity in transcripts with an in-frame AUG downstream of the PTC (Fig. 2a,e, 1.9% vs. 57% NMD efficiency, p = 3.4 &#215; 10&#8211;4; Supplementary Fig. 2d,e), suggesting that translation re-initiation is a widespread mechanism for evading NMD in human genes. The distance between the original start codon and the PTC is a strong predictor for the start-proximal NMD insensitivity, while the distance to the downstream AUG or the Kozak sequence strength of the downstream AUG does not affect the NMD efficiency (Supplementary Fig. 2f,g). However, we observe that efficiency of NMD is still reduced for start-proximal PTCs even in those cases when there are no in-frame downstream AUG codons (57% vs. 93% NMD efficiency), suggesting that other mechanisms can result in NMD bypass. Shorter distances between the best match of the PABPC1 motifs and the PTCs in a hypothetical looped mRNA conformation did not associate with lower NMD efficiency (Supplementary Fig. 2h-k).\nLong exons and the distance to stop codon attenuate NMD\nWhile the start codon proximity and the presence of downstream EJCs explain a substantial part of the variance in NMD efficiency, we hypothesized that there could be additional rules governing whether a nonsense mRNA is targeted by NMD. To elucidate these, we first factored out the known effects of the start proximity and the presence of downstream EJCs on the NMD efficiency (Supplementary Fig. 3f,g). Moreover, we filtered out possible sources of systematic bias in gene expression by a procedure based on principal component analysis26 (Methods).Next, we used Random Forest (RF) regression to predict NMD efficiency using a large set of gene features of plausible importance for NMD. Overall, eight different features contributed to NMD (p < 0.05, RF permutation test; features listed in Supplementary Table 1 and 2, significant features are listed in Supplementary Table 3). As a trivial example that serves as a validation of our methodology, the estimate of NMD efficiency is higher when the variant allele frequencies in the tumor are higher (Supplementary Fig. 3a); our further Random Forest analyses control for this covariate, while searching for rules that govern NMD.We found a significant reduction of NMD efficiency when PTCs are located in exceptionally long exons (Fig. 3a, 61% vs. 98% NMD efficiency, p 400 nt). In these long exons, we found that the NMD efficiency is best explained by the distance between the PTC and the downstream exon junction (Fig. 3b). It is conceivable that the large distance between the stalled ribosome and the EJC results in reduced physical contact with the ribosome-bound UPF1, leading to lower degradation rates.In addition to PTCs in long exons, we also found an unexpected association between reduced NMD efficiency and the distance from the PTC to the normal translation termination site (Fig. 3c, 99% vs. 67% NMD efficiency in the top 20% longest PTC-to-stop distances, p = 1.3 &#215; 10&#8211;7). This is observed after controlling for the start-proximal NMD evasion and the presence of downstream EJCs or long exons. Prior to mRNA decay, the activated UPF1 helicase translocates to the 3&#8242; end of the mRNA to remodel the messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP), while scanning and unwinding the RNA at slow speeds of <1bp/s27. It is conceivable that UPF1 translocation may become rate-limiting for NMD when the distance between the PTC and the normal termination site is large. These new rules validated for frameshift indels and by using Geuvadis allele-specific expression of germline variants (Supplementary Fig. 3).\nmRNA turnover and sequence motifs modulate NMD efficiency\nAn additional feature used by the model was mRNA half-life. Transcripts with a short mRNA half-life have a reduced NMD efficiency (74% vs. 1.2% NMD efficiency when mRNA half-life <1 hour, p = 6.3 &#215; 10&#8211;8, Fig. 3d; Supplementary Fig. 3h,i) and this effect is also observed using mRNA half-life measurements from a different cell type (HeLa vs. B-cells; Supplementary Fig. 3k). These transcripts are already rapidly degraded and enhanced degradation by NMD is likely to only have a small effect on the steady-state mRNA level. In addition, genes with higher wild-type expression levels tend to exhibit more efficient NMD when containing a PTC (Supplementary Fig. 3j); of note, our analyses exclude the lowly expressed genes (&#8804;5 transcripts-per-million, TPM) where the ability to detect NMD may be overwhelmed by technical noise (Methods). As mRNA half-life and gene expression level correlate, it is likely that the reduced NMD efficiency in lowly expressed genes is confounded by shorter mRNA half-lives to some extent. We thus explicitly factored out the expression levels from the NMD efficiency measure prior to further analysis, and found a similar trend (Supplementary Fig. 3l,m), implying that short mRNA half-life is independently associated with inefficient NMD. Expression level estimates of lowly-expressed, rapid-turnover genes are noisier, thus increasing the observed variability of NMD efficiency after adjusting for expression levels. However after pooling the points into five expression level bins a robust association is evident (Fig. 3d; Supplementary Fig. 3k).We next tested whether known28 and de novo inferred RNA-binding protein motifs (Methods) explain a significant portion of the remaining variance in NMD efficiency. We found nine significant motifs (Supplementary Fig. 4), of which four validated in both independent data sets &#8211; the binding sites for SRSF1, PABPN1, SNRPB2 and ACO1 (Fig. 3e; p < 0.10 in Geuvadis and in frameshifts; pooled p-value < 0.005; see URLs, Methods). Existence of these motifs in proximity to a PTC or in the wild-type 3&#8242; UTR is associated with substantially altered NMD efficiency (15%&#8211;48%) in either direction, and we find they may also regulate mRNA degradation in the absence of PTCs (Supplementary Fig. 5a-c; individual examples are discussed in Supplementary Note).As remodeling of mRNA-protein complexes is necessary for NMD, we also tested whether sequence composition (dinucleotide frequencies) and mRNA secondary structure (RNA-RNA interaction probability per nt; Methods) impact NMD efficiency. However, we found neither factor to be associated with NMD efficiency (Supplementary Table 2), consistent with a high in vivo efficiency of the UPF1 helicase in translocating through structured RNA27. In addition, transcript features such as sequence conservation or the stop codon identity of either the PTC or wild-type stop codon did not affect NMD after controlling for other features (not shown). Examined independently, codon usage biases associated with efficient translation show a marginally significant association with lower NMD efficiency (79% vs. 62% NMD efficiency in the top 20% most biased genes, p = 0.04; Supplementary Fig. 5d,e), in agreement with previous yeast data29. This effect is subtle and restricted to the most biased genes, consistent with previous estimates of the prevalence of selected codon usage30. Finally, gene expression is known to be potentially regulated by NMD in wild-type genes when transcripts contain a 3&#8242; UTR intron or a translated upstream open reading frame in their 5&#8242; UTR31. We found that such transcripts exhibit normal NMD efficiencies when additionally targeted for PTC-induced NMD (not shown).\nNMD model explains ~3/4 of the variance in efficiency\nTo quantify how much variance in the efficiency of NMD can be predicted using the rules and features described above, we used Random Forest regression to compare the explained variance in NMD efficiency to the maximum observable variance, given the noise in the data (correction for attenuation; Methods). The regression model explains 74% of the variance in NMD efficiency by drawing on the general NMD features we have defined above (Fig. 4a). We next investigated how much every feature contributes to the prediction to uncover the impact of each NMD rule. Adding the most significantly contributing features one-by-one shows that the canonical EJC model is the most important predictor of NMD, accounting for nearly 1/2 of the observed variance in NMD efficiency. Start-proximal NMD evasion and inefficient NMD in long exons further explain 17% and 4% of the remaining variance, respectively. The mRNA half-life and the distance between the PTC and the wild-type stop codon each explain 1.6%, while the identified motifs account for 0.1% of the variance not explained by all previous features.The amount of explained variance (R2) is a compound measure of the accuracy of each predictor and also of its global coverage of individual examples (PTCs). This can manifest as a low R2 for very strong predictors with limited genomic coverage. For example, the 50-nt boundary rule is highly accurate in our data, meaning that all examples of PTC that fall into this portion of the gene indeed show a near-complete NMD insensitivity. However, the rule covers only a small part of the gene sequence and is thus not pertinent for many occurrences of PTCs in actual transcripts. Similarly, individual RNA binding protein motifs may have a large effect on NMD efficiency (Supplementary Note), but their relatively rare occurrence means they have only a subtle contribution to genome-wide prediction accuracy.We reasoned that one explanation for why we observe residual variance in NMD efficiency could be compensatory changes in gene expression (feedback regulation) masking the effects of increased mRNA decay rates. For example, the expression level of a gene containing an NMD-triggering PTC could be rescued by compensatory up-regulation of the non-mutated allele. In Drosophila, it has been estimated that 50% of genes exhibit some degree of dosage compensation (DC) when heterozygously deleted32, while in humans this effect still remains to be assessed in a systematic manner.Cancer genomics data present an opportunity to globally assess the DC of human genes. In the absence of DC, somatic copy number alterations (CNA) are expected to have a strong effect on gene expression levels33. We thus compared the estimates of copy number gains and losses in tumors (from SNP arrays) to changes in gene expression (by RNA-Seq) across 9,769 cancer patients from the TCGA study. Next, we contrasted the 20% of genes with the strongest evidence of dosage-sensitivity (highest correlation of CNA to expression; putatively non-compensated), with the 20% of genes with least evidence of dosage-sensitivity (low correlation; Methods). We can predict NMD efficiency four-fold more accurately for dosage-sensitive genes (Fig. 4b; R2 = 85% vs. 29%, p = 0.0051). This suggests that feedback regulation of a gene may account for a certain part of the unexplained variance in NMD efficiency (Fig. 4b).\nNegative selection acts on NMD-inducing somatic mutations\nHaving systematically determined influences on NMD efficiency in human cells, we next examined possible roles in carcinogenesis. Positive selection on cancer-promoting driver mutations is well established in cancer genomes22. However, negative (purifying) selection against detrimental mutations has proven difficult to detect34. We reasoned that accounting for the variability of NMD-efficiency amongst PTCs should provide more power to detect purifying selection in cancer genomes.To test for purifying selection on classes of genes we quantified the ratio of nonsense mutations in NMD-sensitive to NMD-insensitive regions of each gene, after normalizing for the local synonymous mutation rate (Fig. 5a,b). This showed that nonsense mutations are depleted in NMD-sensitive regions compared to the NMD-insensitive last exon and first 250 nt (2.2-fold depletion, p = 0.01, Fig. 5c) in oncogenes and also in a set of human essential genes (1.8-fold depletion in the NMD-sensitive regions, p = 0.04, Fig. 5d). Next, we examined which other gene functional categories show depletion of NMD-triggering nonsense mutations. The top scoring Gene Ontology term was &#8220;regulation of cell proliferation&#8221; (Fig. 5e). Other significant categories implicate the spliceosome, cell migration, angiogenesis and the endosome (Fig. 5e, odds ratio > 2, p < 3.2 &#215; 10&#8211;4), suggesting their importance for the fitness of cancer cells. Thus, accounting for variation in the ability of PTCs to trigger NMD suggests widespread purifying selection against detrimental mutations during the evolution of human tumors.\nPositive selection for NMD and tumor suppressor genes\nIn contrast to oncogenes, the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes promotes tumor proliferation and survival. NMD of PTC-containing transcripts should therefore be positively selected during tumor development35. Indeed, PTCs are enriched in regions of tumor suppressor genes predicted to trigger NMD (2.1-fold increase, p = 0.003, Fig. 5f). To systematically investigate how NMD contributes to the somatic inactivation of individual tumor suppressor genes, we quantified how often an NMD-triggering PTC is accompanied by the deletion of the other allele, leading to a complete inactivation (Supplementary Table 4). A principal component analysis on the NMD and somatic deletion frequencies shows three broad clusters of tumor suppressors (Fig. 5g), which suggest a classification of mechanisms of inactivation.First, ~1/3 of the examined tumor suppressors exhibit NMD combined with frequent heterozygous deletion, leading to biallelic inactivation (Fig. 5g-h, bold circles) as expected for haplosufficient tumor suppressors inactivated by a classical &#8216;two-hit&#8217; mechanism. A second cluster containing ~35% of the analyzed tumor suppressor genes undergo deletion less frequently in patients carrying a PTC (Fig. 5g, asterisks), suggesting that a heterozygous inactivation already has functional consequences in some cases (haploinsufficiency). Examples include NF1 (Fig. 5h), where haploinsufficiency is known to contribute to cancer36. Lastly, there is a smaller cluster of tumor suppressors that are frequently mutated by PTCs, but whose transcripts are likely ineffectively degraded by NMD as most of their sequence is predicted to be NMD-insensitive (Fig. 5g-h, triangles). Here the truncated protein could be partially functionally inactive, degraded, or act as a dominant negative.Finally, we examined the prevalence of NMD-mediated inactivation events in an extended list of putative tumor suppressors proposed previously based on an excess of predicted loss-of-function mutations37. For nine such genes with sufficient PTCs in our data (n &#8805; 50), we do not find evidence for frequent two-hit inactivation mechanisms via simultaneous NMD and gene deletion (Supplementary Fig. 6a,b) consistent with these novel cancer genes acting as haploinsufficient tumor suppressors37.\nDiscussion\nIn this study we have used the data from close to ten thousand tumors to provide a systematic and unbiased evaluation of the rules that govern the efficiency of premature stop codons in triggering NMD in human cells. Elucidating these rules is important for the interpretation of clinical genetic data because, as we have illustrated for human tumors, nonsense mutations that do or do not trigger changes in mRNA levels can have very different functional consequences.Our analyses confirmed the canonical EJC model as the most important individual determinant of NMD efficiency. However, they also identified other features important for predicting NMD efficiency genome-wide or in individual transcripts. Moreover, we suggest rapid mRNA turnover and dosage compensation as possible reasons why, even if NMD is triggered, the overall expression level of an mRNA may remain unchanged. The additional features important for predicting NMD genome-wide effects included distance to the start codon exon length and the presence of individual protein binding motifs both close to a PTC and elsewhere in an mRNA.The rules that we determined using somatic nonsense mutations from human tumors (summarized in Fig. 6a) were validated using an independent set of tumor frameshift mutations and also an independent set of germline variants in human lymphoblastoid cell lines20. These rules are thus likely to apply widely across human tissues and diseases.Finally, we showed that by accounting for variation in NMD we could detect both widespread positive and negative selection during the evolution of human tumors. Positive selection on cancer-promoting driver mutations is widely appreciated as contributing to cancer. Quantifying such positive selection on NMD-triggering vs NMD-evading PTCs allowed us to classify known and putative tumor suppressor genes (Fig. 6c). Purifying selection against detrimental somatic mutations has, to our knowledge, previously only been detected for the mitochondrial genome34, while we have shown widespread purifying selection against nonsense mutations that trigger NMD in both oncogenes and the general set of essential genes in human (Fig. 6b). This has important implications for understanding tumor evolution because it supports the notion that subclones are eliminated during tumor progression because they carry detrimental mutations38.Taken together, this study provides important mechanistic insight into NMD and tumor evolution, as well as a broader framework for predicting the effects of nonsense variants in human disease.\nURLs\nMethod for pooling p-values, http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.49.4686.\nOnline Methods\n\nData acquisition\nSomatic nonsense and frameshift mutations aligned to hg19/GRCh37 for available exome sequences of tumors (n = 9,769) together with matching mRNA sequencing data were downloaded on 20-04-2015 from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data portal. Copy number alteration (CNA) and nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) clustering data (based on mRNA levels) for these tumor samples were downloaded from the Broad Institute TCGA Genome Data Analysis Center Firehose pipeline &#8216;analyses__2014_10_17&#8217;. A frameshift mutation results in the translation of an out-of-frame peptide, which will often lead to the incorporation of a premature stop codon. We took the frameshifted sequence to calculate when the translation would prematurely stop (median distance frameshift to PTC = 47 nt) and used these PTCs as a separate validation dataset. Germline nonsense mutations with corresponding allele-specific expression values for 462 lymphoblastoid cell lines from the Geuvadis RNA-sequencing project were downloaded from EBI ArrayExpress under accession E-GEUV-1.\nDominant isoforms\nThe mutations were re-annotated to dominant isoforms in the &#8216;knownGene&#8217; database provided in the &#8216;June2011&#8217; bundle at the TCGA data portal. A gene had a dominant isoform if the expression level of the isoform with the highest expression is at least two times higher than the second-highest expressed isoform42, or if the gene had a single annotated isoform. Dominant isoforms were selected per tumor type to ensure that the RNA-Seq signal of other isoforms of the same gene would not mask changes in expression caused by premature stop codons leaving 15,890&#8211;16,506 dominant transcripts, depending on the tumor type.\nQuantifying NMD efficiency\nNMD efficiency in the TCGA datasets was quantified by comparing the mRNA expression level in transcripts-per-million (TPM) of a PTC bearing transcript to the median mRNA expression level of the same transcript in tumor samples where the PTC was absent. To minimize interference from inter-tumor heterogeneity when calculating the median mRNA expression level for a transcript, we first separated the samples by tumor type and then used the most robust consensus NMF clustering (Broad GDAC Firehose) to further separate tumor samples. Within these clusters, a median mRNA expression value was calculated for every transcript from the samples that had no nonsense mutations, indel mutations or copy number variations overlapping this transcript. The mRNA expression level of every PTC-bearing transcript was then divided by the median mRNA expression level of that transcript, which was &#8211;log2 transformed to get NMD efficiency values where 0 indicates no mRNA degradation and 1 complete heterozygous mRNA degradation by NMD.NMD efficiency in the Geuvadis dataset was quantified by dividing the allele-specific expression of a PTC bearing allele by the reference allele. Allele-specific expression values were taken from the Geuvadis study20, which were determined as described in Pirinen et al.43. In short, for every SNV the RNA-Seq reads were aligned to both the reference genome and the mutated genome, allowing for no mismatches. The &#8211;log2 transformed ratio of the reads mapping to the variant allele divided over the reference allele reads is here defined as NMD efficiency, where 0 indicates no mRNA degradation and complete heterozygous mRNA degradation approaches infinity. Compared to TCGA, the Geuvadis dataset contains six times fewer PTCs at unique loci, which is not enough data points for rigorous validation for NMD rules that only apply to a very small part of the gene sequence (Supplementary Figs. 2a and 3e).While quantifying NMD efficiency with allele-specific expression has the major advantage that there is no need to compare different samples, it comes at the cost of having fewer data points to accurately approximate the expression level. Normal mRNA expression values are derived from all RNA-Seq reads aligning to any part of the transcript sequence, which can be thousands of sequence reads. In contrast, allele-specific expression is based on only the sequence reads that overlap with the SNV. Therefore we investigated the rules of NMD with NMD efficiency measures derived from mRNA expression values (TGCA nonsense mutations, method 1) and validated the findings using an independent set of PTCs with mRNA expression values (TCGA frameshift induced PTCs, method 1) and also the allele-specific expression derived NMD efficiency measures (Geuvadis nonsense mutations, method 2) to evaluate any method-related biases. The effect sizes of the characterized NMD rules supplied in the text are calculated by comparing the maximum observable NMD efficiency to the median NMD efficiency of the PTCs affected by the respective NMD rule. Here, the maximum observable NMD efficiency is defined as the median NMD efficiency of NMD inducing PTCs when taking the known rules into account and used as 100% NMD efficiency. Since we characterize NMD rules in a nested fashion throughout this manuscript, wherein we control for all previously examined effects while measuring the next one, the maximum observable NMD efficiency increases throughout this manuscript as new rules are added.\nVariant filtering and noise reduction\nStringent filtering was applied on the TCGA data when calculating the NMD efficiency. PTC bearing transcripts were removed if they contained additional indel, nonsense or splice site disrupting (+/&#8211; 3 nt from an exon junction) variants or had overlap with a CNA. Furthermore, nonsense and frameshift mutations needed to be present at an allele frequency of 20% or higher. When calculating the median expression level of all transcripts to compare the expression of a PTC bearing transcript with, we excluded transcripts with a median expression level lower than five and transcripts with large variation in expression among the tumor samples (coefficient of variation > 0.5). A threshold of at least 10 wild-type measurements (samples) per transcript per NMF cluster was used to calculate an accurate median expression value. Lastly, to increase the power of the Random Forest regression to detect new NMD rules, we reduced variability in the expression data by removing hidden covariates with principal component analysis (PCA). Several studies have shown that PCA can successfully increase power to associate gene expression changes with SNVs by removing non-random sources of noise26,44. We applied PCA to the mRNA expression data and took out the first four principal components for every tumor type. These four components comprise sources of unwanted technical of biological variation, but not variation introduced by individual SNVs.To accurately determine NMD efficiency based on allele-specific expression, we only included variants that had at least one variant read and at least ten mRNA-Seq reads in total. To prevent overfitting on highly prevalent nonsense mutations, we collapsed SNVs that were found in more than one individual, and used the median NMD efficiency for further analyses.\nData analysis\nAll analyses were performed in Python 2.7.2. and R 3.1.2 (R Core Team). PCA was done with the &#8216;FactoMineR&#8217; package in R, where we modified the &#8216;reconst&#8217; function to take out principal components. We used the &#8216;randomForest&#8217; package for Random Forest regression, and the &#8216;rfPermute&#8217; package to compute p values for feature contribution. Unless stated otherwise, a two-tailed Mann&#8211;Whitney test was used to compute p-values. When p-values were pooled across multiple tests, a formula described previously (see URLs) was used. Briefly, p1, p2 and p3 are the three p-values to combine, &#961; is their product p1p2p3, and the combined p-value is found thusly: pc=&#961;{1+log1&#961;+12(log1&#961;)2}In Supplementary Figures 1-3, the blue lines show the fits to the data point using the R package &#8216;ggplot&#8217;, function geom_smooth. In cases with <1,000 points, this uses the R function loess with default parameters (linear fit, using the smoothing parameter width of 0.75). In cases with &#8805;1,000 points, the R function gam is used, invoking a generalized additive model with smoothing terms represented by penalized regression splines. The shaded areas are 95% confidence interval of the fit.In all figures, box plots are drawn using the defaults of the R package ggplot: the center line is the median of the data distribution, the notch around this line is the approximate 95% C.I. of the median, 1.58 * IQR / sqrt(n), the hinges are the 1st and the 3rd quartile, and the whiskers extend to the lowest/highest non-outlying values (those that are within 1.5 * IQR of the upper or the lower hinge).\nModeling NMD\nRandom Forest regression was used to identify gene features that influence NMD efficiency. Random Forest is a robust and easily interpretable machine learning approach that accepts mixed data types and internally controls for overfitting. To learn about new features that influence NMD efficiency, we first factored out the major rules of NMD that we found manually. In particular, we predicted NMD efficiency with a Random Forest regression having the knowledge whether the PTC was located on the last exon, 50 nt before the last exon, in proximity to the start codon and the allele frequency of the nonsense mutation (&#8216;randomForest&#8217; package, 1,000,000 trees, mtry = 1). We subtracted the predicted NMD efficiencies from the original values to remove the confounding effects of these known NMD rules. Next, we used Random Forest regression again to predict these adjusted NMD efficiencies from 2,390 gene features hypothesized to influence NMD efficiency (&#8216;randomForest&#8217; package, 100,000 trees, mtry = 13). Here, the 100 most important features (highest percentage increase in mean squared error) were used to determine which features contribute significantly at p < 0.05 to the NMD efficiency prediction (&#8216;rfPermute&#8217; package, 10,000 trees, 1,000 permutations), resulting in eight significantly contributing features that were selected for further manual inspection.To build our Random Forest model, we made a comprehensive table of different features that we hypothesized to influence NMD efficiency (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). Sequence conservation of all vertebrates in &#8216;phyloP46way&#8217; downloaded from the UCSC Genome Browser website was used to create the sequence conservation features. A basewise probability score for the mRNA secondary structure was computed with Rfold 0.1-2. Optimal codon usage was used as a proxy for the translation efficiency and was computed by dividing the amount of optimal in-frame codons over the codon count. Optimal codons were defined as the ones corresponding to the tRNA genes with the highest copy number in the human genome45. Weeder 2.0 was used to discover de novo RNA motifs that influence NMD efficiency, by ranking the PTC bearing transcripts by NMD efficiency and comparing the top 10% to the bottom 10% of the transcripts for motif enrichment. De novo motifs were pooled with known RNA binding protein motifs from Ray et al.28 and used to scan mRNA sequences. Motifs that were found to be significantly contributing to the Random Forest were manually investigated to determine a threshold for the binding score. Mono- and di-nucleotide frequencies were computed by counting the occurrence of the four nucleotides and all 64 dinucleotide combinations, respectively. The above described features were computed for the following regions of interest of each transcript: +/&#8211; 100 nt of the PTC, +/&#8211; 100 nt of the exon junction downstream the PTC, the 3&#8242; UTR region, the 5&#8242; UTR region, the region between the PTC and the normal stop codon and the whole transcript sequence. In addition, RNA motif scanning was also performed in the first and last 200 nt of each transcript. For sequence conservation, RNA folding score and codon optimality, the median score for each region was used as input for the Random Forest regression. The mRNA half-life feature is based on Friedel et al.46 (Supplementary Table 2: RNA half-lives in human B-cells) and is validated with mRNA half-life measures in HeLa cells47. A list of translated upstream open reading frames from Andreev et al.48 was kindly provided by Patrick BF O'Connor.A correction for attenuation procedure was used to remove the measurement error to investigate how much of the variation in NMD efficiency could be explained with the rules we defined. A Spearman correlation on the NMD efficiency of replicated data points (same nonsense mutation in several tumor samples) showed 22.5% explainable variance in the data. Next we used Random Forest regression (&#8216;randomForest&#8217; package, 100,000 trees, mtry = 3) to determine the added explained variance for each feature, starting with the most important one. Including all validated rules in the Random Forest explained 16.6% of the variance, which equals 74% of the explainable variance in NMD efficiency.\nPurifying selection\nTo test whether there is purifying selection in essential and cancer genes, we defined the first 250 nt, the 50 nt before the last exon and the whole last exon of a transcript as NMD-insensitive regions and compared the nonsense mutation density to the NMD-sensitive region. The nonsense mutation density was normalized to the synonymous mutation density, to correct for differences in the mutational landscape. Two standard deviations of 10,000 bootstrap samples are shown in the error bars, while empirical p-values were computed with 10,000 permutations. The 200 most essential genes published by Hart et al.40 were used as essential genes and 220 oncogenes were taken from the Cancer Gene Census39 (Molecular Genetics = &#8216;Dom&#8217;), after manual removal of leukemia-specific cancer genes. To test whether genes that promote carcinogenesis when successfully silenced are enriched for nonsense mutations in NMD-sensitive regions, we took the 200 highest scoring STOP genes from Solimini et al.41 Gene Ontology enrichment analysis for gene sets under negative selection of somatic nonsense mutations was done on the UniProt-GOA release 15449 by calculating the log2 odds ratio of NMD-sensitive and insensitive somatic nonsense mutations normalized for the synonymous mutation densities for every gene set bigger than 30 genes.\nSupplementary Material\n", "pmid": "27618451", "title": "The rules and impact of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay in human cancers", "journal_title": "Nature genetics", "authors": "Rik G.H.

Accordingly, to effectively assess the performance of metagenomic analysis software, a wide range of benchmark data sets are required.Results\nWe describe the CAMISIM microbial community and metagenome simulator. The software can model different microbial abundance profiles, multi-sample time series, and differential abundance studies, includes real and simulated strain-level diversity, and generates second- and third-generation sequencing data from taxonomic profiles or de novo. Gold standards are created for sequence assembly, genome binning, taxonomic binning, and taxonomic profiling. CAMSIM generated the benchmark data sets of the first CAMI challenge. For two simulated multi-sample data sets of the human and mouse gut microbiomes, we observed high functional congruence to the real data. As further applications, we investigated the effect of varying evolutionary genome divergence, sequencing depth, and read error profiles on two popular metagenome assemblers, MEGAHIT, and metaSPAdes, on several thousand small data sets generated with CAMISIM.Conclusions\nCAMISIM can simulate a wide variety of microbial communities and metagenome data sets together with standards of truth for method evaluation.

We have since learned that naturally occurring microbial communities cover a wide range of organismal complexities&#8212;with populations ranging from half a dozen to likely tens of thousands of members&#8212;can include substantial strain level diversity and vary widely in represented taxa [9&#8211;12]. Analyzing these diverse communities is challenging.The problem is exacerbated by use of a wide range of experimental setups in data generation and the rapid evolution of short- and long-read sequencing technologies [13, 14]. Owing to the large diversity of generated data, the possibility to generate realistic benchmark data sets for particular experimental setups is essential for assessing computational metagenomics software.CAMI, the initiative for the Critical Assessment of Metagenome Interpretation, is a community effort aiming to generate extensive, objective performance overviews of computational metagenomics software [15]. CAMI organizes benchmarking challenges and encourages the development of standards and reproducibility in all aspects, such as data generation, software application, and result interpretation [16].We here describe CAMISIM, which was originally written to generate the simulated metagenome data sets used in the first CAMI challenge. It has since been extended into a versatile and highly modular metagenome simulator. We demonstrate the usability and utility of CAMISIM with several applications. We generated complex, multi-replicate benchmark data sets from taxonomic profiles of human and mouse gut microbiomes [1, 17]. We also simulated thousands of small &#8220;minimally challenging metagenomes&#8221; to characterize the effect of varying sequencing coverage, evolutionary divergence of genomes, and sequencing error profiles on the popular MEGAHIT [18] and metaSPAdes [19] assemblers.\nThe CAMISIM software\nCAMISIM allows customization of many properties of the generated communities and data sets, such as the overall number of genomes (community complexity), strain diversity, the community genome abundance distributions, sample sizes, the number of replicates, and sequencing technology used. For setting these options, a configuration file is needed, which is described in Additional file&#160;1. Simulation with CAMISIM has three stages (Fig.&#160;1): \nDesign of the community, which includes selection of the community members and their genomes, and assigning them relative abundances,\nFig. 1UML diagram of the CAMISIM workflow. CAMISIM starts with the &#8220;community design&#8221; step, which can either be de novo, requiring a taxon mapping file and reference genomes or based on a taxonomic profile. This step produces a community genome and taxon profile which is used for the metagenome simulation using one of currently four read simulators (ART, wgsim, PBsim, NanoSim). The resulting reads and bam-files mapping the reads to the original genomes are used to create the gold standards before all the files can be anonymized and shuffled in the post-processing stepMetagenome sequencing data simulation, andPostprocessing, where the binning and assembly gold standards are produced.\nCommunity design\nIn this step, the community genome abundance profiles, called Pout, are created. These also represent the gold standard for taxonomic profiling and, from the strain to the superkingdom rank, specify the relative abundances of individual strains (genomes) or their parental taxa in percent. In addition, a genome sequence collection for the strains in Pout is generated. Both Pout and the genome sequence collection are needed for the metagenome simulation in step 2. The taxonomic composition of the simulated microbial community is either determined by user-specified taxonomic profiles or generated de novo by sampling from available genome sequences.\nProfile-based design\nTaxonomic profiles can be provided in BIOM (Biological Observation Matrix) format [20]. With input profiles, the NCBI complete genomes [21] are used as the sequence collection for creating metagenome data sets. Optionally, the user can choose to also include genomes marked as &#8220;scaffold&#8221; or &#8220;contig&#8221; by the NCBI. Input genomes are split at positions with multiple occurrences of ambiguous bases, such that no reads spanning contig borders within larger scaffolds are simulated.Profiles can include bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryotic taxa, as well as viruses. The taxonomic identifiers of BIOM format are interpreted as free text scientific names and are mapped to NCBI taxon IDs (algorithm in Additional file&#160;1). The so generated input profile Pin specifies pairs (t,abt) of taxon IDs t and taxon abundances \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$ab_{t} \\in \\mathbb {R}_{\\geq 0}$\\end{document}abt&#8712;&#8477;&#8805;0. The profile taxa are usually defined at higher ranks than strain and thus have to be mapped approximately to the genome sequence collection for creating Pout.Given an ordered list of ranks R = (species, genus, family, order, class, phylum, superkingdom), CAMISIM requires as an additional parameter a highest rank rmax&#8712;R. We define the binary operator &#8826; based on the ordering of the ranks in R. Given two ranks, ri,rj&#8712;R, we write ri&#8826;rj, if ri appears before rj in R, and we say ri is below rj. Related complete genomes are searched for all ranks below rmax. By default, this is the family rank. Another parameter is the maximum number of strains m that are included for an input taxon in a simulated sample.To create Pout from Pin, the following steps are performed: let Gin be the set of taxon IDs of the genome collection at the lowest annotated taxonomic rank, usually species or strain. For all t&#8712;Gin, the reference taxonomy specifies a taxonomic lineage of taxon IDs (or undefined values) across the considered ranks in R. We use these to identify a collection of sets F={Gt | t=lineage taxon represented by&#8805;1 complete genome}, which specifies for each lineage taxon the taxon IDs of available genomes from the genome collection. F is used as input for Algorithm 1.\n\nThe algorithm retrieves for each t from the tuples (t,abt)&#8712;Pin the lineage path taxt across the ranks of R (lines 2&#8211;3). Moving from the species to the highest considered rank, rmax, the algorithm determines whether for a lineage taxon tr at the considered rank r a complete genome exists, that is, whether Gt&#8800;&#8709; for t=tr (lines 4&#8211;5). If this is the case, the search ends and tr is considered further (line 6). If no complete genome is found for a particular lineage, the lineage is not included in the simulated community, and a warning is issued (line 20). Next, the number of genomes X with their taxonomic IDs tr to be added to Pout is drawn from a truncated geometric distribution (Eq. 1, line 8) with a mean of \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$\\mu = \\frac {m}{2}$\\end{document}&#956;=m2 and the parameter k restricted to be less than m. \n1\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document} $$ P(X = k) = \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\right)^{k} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\mu}  $$ \\end{document}P(X=k)=1&#8722;1&#956;k&#183;1&#956;If \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$|G_{t_{r}}|$\\end{document}|Gtr| is less than X, \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$G_{t_{r}}$\\end{document}Gtr is used entirely as Gselected, the genomes of tr that are to be included in the community.

The mapping file defines for each genome a taxonomic ID (per default from the NCBI taxonomy), a novelty category and an operational taxonomic unit (OTU) ID. Grouping genomes into OTUs is required for sampling related genomes, to increase strain-level diversity in the simulated microbial communities. The novelty category reflects how closely a query genome is related to draft or complete genomes in a genome sequence reference collection. This is used to maximize the spread of selected genomes across the range of taxonomic distances to the genome reference collection, such that there are genomes included of &#8220;novel&#8221; strains, species, or genera. This distinction is relevant for evaluating reference-based taxonomic binners and profilers, which may perform differently across these different categories. The user can manually generate the mapping file as described in Additional file&#160;1 or in [15].If controlled sampling of strains is not required, every genome can be assigned to a different OTU ID. If no reference-based taxonomic binners or profilers are to be evaluated, or the provided genome sequence collection does not vary much in terms of taxonomic distance to publicly available genomes used as references for these programs, all genomes can be assigned the same novelty category.In addition, the number of genomes greal to be drawn from the input genome selection and the total number of genomes gtot for the community genome abundance profile Pout have to be specified. The greal real genomes are drawn from the provided genome sampling collection. An equal number of genomes is drawn for every novelty category. If the number of genomes for a category is insufficient, proportionately more are drawn from others. In addition, CAMISIM simulates gsim=gtot&#8722;greal genomes of closely related strains from the chosen real genomes in total. These genomes are created with an enhanced version of sgEvolver [22] (Additional file&#160;1: Methods) from a subset of randomly selected real genomes. Given m, the maximum number of strains per OTU, up to m&#8722;1 simulated strain genomes are added per genome. The exact number of genomes X to be simulated for a selected OTU is drawn from a geometric distribution with mean &#956;=0.3&#8722;1 (Eq. 1). This procedure is repeated until gsim-related genomes have been added to the community genome collection, comprising gtot=greal+gsim genomes [15].Next, community genomes are assigned abundances. The relevant user-defined parameters for this step are the sample type and the number of samples n. In addition to single samples, multi-sample data sets (with differential abundances, replicates or time series) have become widely used in real sequencing studies [23&#8211;26], also due to their utility for genome recovery using covariance-based genome binners such as CONCOCT [27] or MetaBAT [28]. Several options for creating multi-sample metagenome data sets with these setups are provided: \nIf simulating a single sample data set, the relative abundances are drawn from a lognormal distribution, which is commonly used to model microbial communities [29&#8211;32]. The two parameters of the lognormal distribution can be changed. By default, the mean is set to 1 and the standard deviation to 2 (Eq. 2). Setting the standard deviation &#963; to 0 results in a uniform distribution.The differential abundance mode models a community sampled multiple times after the environmental conditions or the DNA extraction protocols (and accordingly the community abundance profile) have been altered. This mode creates n different lognormally (Eq. 2) distributed genome abundance profiles.Metagenome data sets with multiple samples with very similar genome abundance distributions can be created using the replicates mode. Having multiple replicates of the same metagenome has been reported to improve the quality for some metagenome analysis software, such as for genome binners [23, 27, 33, 34]. Based on an initial log-normal distribution D0, n samples are created by adding Gaussian noise to this initial distribution (Eq. 4). The Gaussian term accounts for all kinds of effects on the genome abundances of the metagenomic replicates including, but not limited to, different experimenters, different place of extraction, or other batch effects. \n4\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document} $$ \\begin{aligned} D_{i} = D_{0} + \\varepsilon \\, \\text{with} \\; \\varepsilon & \\sim N(0,1) \\; \\text{and} \\\\ \\varepsilon &\\sim N(0,1) \\\\ \\Leftrightarrow \\frac{d}{dx}P(\\varepsilon \\leq x) &= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\cdot e^{-\\frac{1}{2}x^{2}} \\end{aligned}  $$ \\end{document}Di=D0+&#949;with&#949;&#8764;N(0,1)and&#949;&#8764;N(0,1)&#8660;ddxP(&#949;&#8804;x)=12&#960;&#183;e&#8722;12x2Time series metagenome data sets with multiple related samples can be created.

This emulates the natural process of fluctuating abundances over time and ensures that the abundance changes to the previously sampled metagenome do not grow very large. \n5\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document} $$ \\hfill \\begin{aligned} D_{i} &= D_{i-1} + \\varepsilon & \\text{with} \\\\ D_{0} &\\sim \\text{Lognormal}(\\mu,\\sigma) & \\text{and} \\\\ \\varepsilon &\\sim N(0,1) & \\text{or} \\\\ D_{i} &= \\frac{D_{i-1} + \\varepsilon}{2} & \\text{with} \\\\ \\varepsilon &\\sim \\text{Lognormal}(\\mu,\\sigma) & \\\\ \\end{aligned} \\hfill   $$ \\end{document}Di=Di&#8722;1+&#949;withD0&#8764;Lognormal(&#956;,&#963;)and&#949;&#8764;N(0,1)orDi=Di&#8722;1+&#949;2with&#949;&#8764;Lognormal(&#956;,&#963;)\nMetagenome simulation\nMetagenome data sets are generated from the genome abundance profiles of the community design step.

The profile has been trained on MBARC-26 [36], a defined mock community that has already been used to benchmark bioinformatics software and a full-length 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing protocol [37, 38], and is distributed with CAMISIM. Other ART profiles, such as the one used for the first CAMI challenge, can also be used. Further available read simulators are wgsim (https://github.com/lh3/wgsim, originally part of SAMtools [39]) for simulating error-free short reads, pbsim [40] for simulating Pacific Biosciences data and nanosim [41] for simulating Oxford Nanopore Technologies reads. The read lengths and insert sizes can be varied for some simulators.For every sample of a data set, CAMISIM generates FASTQ files and a BAM file [39]. The BAM file specifies the alignment of the simulated reads to the reference genomes.\nGold standard creation and postprocessing\nFrom the simulated metagenome data sets&#8212;the FASTQ and BAM files&#8212;CAMISIM creates the assembly and binning gold standards. The software extracts the perfect assembly for each individual sample, and a perfect co-assembly of all samples together by identifying all genomic regions with a coverage of at least one using SAMtools&#8217; mpileup and extracting these as error-free contigs. This gold standard does not include all genome sequences available for the simulation, but the best possible assembly of their sampled reads.CAMISIM generates the genome and taxon binning gold standards for the reads and assembled contigs, respectively. These specify the genome and taxonomic lineage that the individual sequences belong to. All sequences can be anonymized and shuffled (but tracked throughout the process), to enable their use in benchmarking challenges. Lastly, files are compressed with gzip and written to the specified output location.\nResults\n\nComparison to the state-of-the-art\nWe tested seven simulators and compared them to CAMISIM (Table&#160;1). All generate Illumina data and some&#8212;NeSSM [42], BEAR [43], FASTQSim [44], and Grinder [45]&#8212;also use a taxonomic profile. Novel and unique to CAMISIM is the ability to simulate long-read data from Oxford Nanopore, of hybrid data sets with multiple sequencing technologies and multi-sample data sets, such as with replicates, time series, or differential abundances. Grinder [45] can also create multiple samples, but only with differential abundances. In addition, CAMISIM creates gold standards for assembly (single sample assemblies and multi-sample co-assemblies), for taxonomic and genome binning of reads or contigs and for taxonomic profiling. Finally, CAMISIM can evolve multiple strains for selected input genomes and allows specification of the degree of real and simulated intra-species heterogeneity within a data set.\nTable 1Properties of popular metagenome sequence simulatorsSoftwareDe novoProfileMultiStrainsNon-Illumina dataLicensedUpdatedMetaSim [62]&#10003;XX&#10003;454P, AU03/2009iMESS [63]&#10003;XXX454&#8211;07/2014BBMap [64]&#10003;XXX&#8211;LBL01/2019NeSSM [42]&#10003;&#10003;XX454AU07/2013BEAR [43]&#10003;&#10003;XX&#8211;AU02/2017FASTQSim [44]&#10003;&#10003;XXSOLiD, IonTorrent, PacBioGPL05/2015Grinder [45]&#10003;&#10003;&#10003;XSanger, 454GPL04/2016CAMISIM&#10003;&#10003;&#10003;&#10003;PacBio, ONT, &#8230;Apache 2.001/2019Abbreviations: P, proprietary software; AU, academic use only; LBL, Lawrence Berkeley LabThe table shows if an abundance profile can be generated by the simulator de novo and if an existing profile of a microbial community can be used as input. Further inspected features are the ability to simulate multi-sample data sets, strains, and non-Illumina data (e.g., long reads). Lastly, the table states if and how a software is licensed, and the date it was last recently updated\nEffect of data properties on assemblies\nWe created several thousand &#8220;minimally challenging&#8221; metagenome samples by varying one data property relevant for assembly, while keeping all others the same. Using these, we studied the effect of evolutionary divergence between genomes, different error profiles, and coverage on the popular metaSPAdes [19], version 3.12.0, and MEGAHIT [18], versions 1.1.2 and 1.0.3, assemblers, to systematically investigate reported performance declines for assemblers in the presence of strain-level diversity, uneven coverage distributions, and abnormal error profiles [15, 46, 47]. Both MEGAHIT and metaSPAdes work on de Bruijn graphs, which are created by splitting the input reads into smaller parts, the k-mers, and connecting two k-mers if they overlap by exactly k-1 letters. For every sequencing error k erroneous k-mers are introduced into the de Bruijn graph, which might substantially impact assembly (Fig.&#160;2).\nFig. 2Assembly graphs become more complex as coverage increases. MEGAHIT assembly graphs (k = 41) of an E. coli K12 genome for 2 &#215;, 32 &#215;, and 512 &#215; per-base coverage, respectively, visualized with Bandage [60]. For 2 &#215; coverage, the graph is disconnected and thus the assembly fragmented. With increasing coverage more and more unitigs can be joined, first resulting in a decent assembly for 32 &#215; coverage, but&#8212;due to sequencing errors adding erroneous edges to the graph&#8212;a fragmented assembly again for 512 &#215; coverage\nVarying genome coverage and sequencing error rates\nWe initially simulated samples from Escherichia coli K12 MG1655 with varying coverage and different error rates. Reads were generated at 512 &#215; genome coverage and subsampled stepwise by 50% until 2 &#215; coverage was reached, resulting in a sample series with 512, 256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, and 2-fold coverage, respectively. Subsampling was employed to control variation in the sampling of different genomic regions. To assess the effect of sequencing errors, four read data sets were simulated: three using wgsim with uniform error rates of 0%, 2%, and 5%, and one using ART with the CAMI challenge error profile (ART CAMI).Both assemblers were run on these data sets with default options, except for the phred-offset parameter for metaSPAdes, which was set to 33. Both assemblers performed similar across all error rates and coverages, with assembly quality varying substantially with coverage (Fig.&#160;3). Performance on the data generated with the 5% error profile was worst throughout. This is an unrealistically high error profile for Illumina data [47] that software need not necessarily be adapted to handle well.\nFig. 3Coverage dependent assembly performance for MEGAHIT and metaSPAdes. Shown are the metrics, from top to bottom: genome fraction in %, number of contigs, and NGA50 (as reported by QUAST [61]), for 0%, 2%, and 5% uniform error rate, and with the ART CAMI error profile compared to the best possible metrics (gold standard) on the ART CAMI profile (dashed black)If coverage was low, assembly failed, generating a large number of small (low NGA50) contigs covering only a small genome portion (genome fraction) across all data sets, because of uncovered regions in the genomes. Sequencing errors (denoted &#949;) do not play a major role (Fig.&#160;2). The expected per-base error-rate Ep=cov&#183;&#949; (disregarding the biased errors in the short-read sequencing technologies) is far below 1 (Ep&#8810;1). With increasing coverage, assembly improved consistently across the 0%, 2%, and CAMISIM ART error profile data sets and both assemblers for all metrics (Fig.&#160;3), and reaching an early plateau by 8&#8211;16 &#215; coverage.Notably, the performance of an earlier version of MEGAHIT (1.0.3) decreased substantially (declining genome fraction and NGA50) for more than 128 &#215; coverage, except for error-free reads. For instance, at 5% error rate, MEGAHIT, version 1.0.3, generated an exponential number of contigs at high coverages, which keeps the genome fraction artificially high. For these high coverages and error rates, we expect multiple errors at every position of the genome (Ep&#8811;10). This creates de Bruijn graphs with many junctions and bubbles (Fig.&#160;2) which cannot easily be resolved and may lead to breaking the assembly apart and covering the same part of the genome with multiple, short, and erroneous contigs (Fig.&#160;3).\nEffect of evolutionary relatedness on assembler performances\nWe systematically investigated the effect of related strains on assembler performances across a wide range of taxa and evolutionary divergences, using the genomes of 152 species from the interactive tree of life iTol [48], which includes bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. For each genome, we evolved 19 related genomes without larger insertions and deletions and an average nucleotide identity (ANI) between 90% and 99.5% to the original one using steps of 0.5%. For each of the 152&#183;20=3040 pairs of original and evolved genome sequences, we simulated single sample minimal metagenomes at equal genome abundances, with error-free reads at 50 &#215; coverage using wgsim. This constitutes good coverage for the analyzed assemblers, as shown in the previous section. For the resulting samples, variation in assembler performance should thus primarily be caused by differences in ANI.The presence of closely related genomes substantially affected assembly quality (Fig.&#160;4). For up to 95% ANI, the assemblers restored high quality assemblies for both genomes. Between 95% and 99% ANI, the genome fraction and assembly size dropped substantially and contig numbers increased. This was the case if we allowed contigs to either map uniquely to one reference genome or to both, in case of multiple optimal mappings. For more closely related genomes, the number of contigs increased drastically and the assembly size continued to drop. The genome fraction remained high when considering non-unique mappings, but decreased for unique mappings; the explanation for this observed behavior is that for an ANI of more than 99%, assemblers produced consensus contigs of the two strains that mostly aligned similarly well to both reference genomes. This was the case for all 152 genomes and their evolved counterparts.\nFig. 4Genome fraction calculated using unique or multiple best mappings in case of ties to the community genome collection. Left: genome fraction for the E. coli assembly created by MEGAHIT from error-free reads (top) and with ART CAMI error profile (bottom). Right: average genome fraction and standard deviation for all original 152 iTol genomes created by MEGAHIT from error-free reads (top) and with ART CAMI error profile (bottom). Error bars denote 1 &#215; standard deviation\nSimulating environment-specific data sets\nTo test the ability to create metagenome data of the human microbiome, we simulated metagenomes from taxonomic profiles of the Human Microbiome Project [9] for different body sites with CAMISIM. We selected 49 samples from the airways, gastrointestinal tract, oral cavity, skin and urogenital tract, with whole genome shotgun (WGS) and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequence data available. We used the published QIIME OTU table (https://hmpdacc.org/hmp/HMQCP/) to generate 5 Gb of simulated reads per sample with CAMISIM, resulting in a data set of 245 Gb of Illumina data, and of PacBio data, respectively. Only genomes tagged as &#8220;complete genomes&#8221; in the NCBI were considered in the data set generation. To decrease the chance of OTUs not being represented by a genome, the option of allowing multiple OTUs being represented by a single reference genome was turned on. This can be relevant for instance when due to sequencing errors in 16S rRNA data, individual community genomes are represented by multiple OTUs.For a functional comparison of the simulated data with the original metagenome shotgun data, we inferred KEGG Ortholog family abundance profiles from the raw read data sets [49]. To this end, all reads were searched with Diamond v0.9.10 using its blastx command with default options [50] against the KEGG GENES database (release 77, species_prokaryotes, best-hit approach) and linked to KEGG Orthology (KO) via the KEGG mapping files. KO profile similarity between the simulated and original metagenome samples was calculated with Pearson&#8217;s correlation coefficient (PCC) and Spearman rank correlation (SRC), and visualized with non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) [51].For comparison, we also created functional profiles with PICRUSt [52], using a prediction model generated from 3772 KEGG genomes and corresponding 16S rRNA gene sequences according to the PICRUSt &#8220;Genome Prediction Tutorial&#8221; (Additional file&#160;1). The PCC of the CAMISIM and original samples approached a striking 0.97 for body sites with high bacterial abundances and many sequenced genomes available, such as the GI tract and oral cavity, and still ranged from 0.72 to 0.91 for airways, skin and urogenital tract samples (Fig.&#160;5b). All PCCs were 7&#8211;30% higher than the PCC of PICRUSt with the original metagenome samples. Thus, CAMISIM created metagenome samples functionally even closer to the original metagenome samples than the functional profiles created by PICRUSt. The higher PCC may also partly be due to the fact that the original and CAMISIM data were annotated by &#8220;blasting&#8221; reads versus KEGG, while the PICRUSt profiles were directly generated from KEGG genome annotations. The Spearman correlation of the simulated CAMISIM samples to the original metagenome samples was slightly lower than the PCC across all body sites, and very similar for CAMISIM and PICRUSt (0&#8211;6% improvement of CAMISIM over PICRUSt). These results demonstrate the quality of the CAMISIM samples.\nFig. 5Comparison of CAMISIM and PICRUSt functional profiles for different body sites. a NMDS ordination of the functional predictions of individual samples by the different methods. The different body sites are color-coded and labeled with their sample number. The original WGS is denoted by squares, the CAMISIM result as circles and the PICRUSt result as triangles. b Mean and standard deviation of Pearson and Spearman correlation to original WGS samples per body site. C, CAMISIM; P, PICRUStThe NMDS plot (Fig.&#160;5a) showed a very distinct clustering of the CAMISIM and original WGS samples by body site, more closely than the original samples clustered with the PICRUSt profiles. Even though the urogenital tract samples did not cluster perfectly, the CAMISIM samples still formed a very distinct cluster close to the original one. Even outliers in the original samples were, at least partly, detected and correctly simulated (both original and simulated sample 26 of urogenital tract cluster most closely with the gastrointestinal tract microbiomes).We also provide a multi-sample mouse gut data set for software developers to benchmark against. For 64 16S rRNA samples from the mouse gut [17], we simulated 5 Gb of Illumina and PacBio reads each. The mice were obtained from 12 different vendors and the samples characterized by 16S V4 amplicon sequencing (OTU mapping file in Additional file&#160;1). Since for mouse gut only a few complete reference genomes were available, the &#8220;scaffold&#8221; quality for downloading genomes was chosen.\nDiscussion and conclusions\nCAMISIM is a flexible program for simulating a large variety of microbial communities and metagenome samples. To our knowledge, it possesses the most complete feature set for simulating realistic microbial communities and metagenome data sets. This feature set includes simulation from taxonomic profiles as templates, inclusion of both natural and simulated strain level diversity, and modelling multi-sample data sets with different underlying community abundance distributions. Read simulators are included for short-read (Illumina) and long-read (PacBio, ONT) sequencing technologies, allowing the generation of hybrid data sets. This turns CAMISIM into a versatile metagenome simulation pipeline, as modules for new (or updated) sequencing technologies and emerging experimental setups can easily be incorporated.We systematically explored the effect of specific data properties on assembler performances on several thousand minimally challenging metagenomes. While low coverage reduced assembly quality for both assemblers, metaSPAdes and MEGAHIT performed generally well for medium to high coverages and different error profiles. Notably, MEGAHIT is computationally very efficient and overall performed well. As noted before [15, 53], assemblers had problems with resolving closely related genomes in our experiments. For an in-depth investigation, we systematically analyzed the effect of related strains on MEGAHIT&#8217;s performance across a wide range of taxa and evolutionary divergences. The average nucleotide identity (ANI) between two genomes is a robust measure of genome relatedness; an ANI value of 95% roughly corresponds to a 70% DNA-DNA reassociation value&#8212;a historical definition of bacterial species [54, 55]. For an pairwise ANI below 95%, the mixture of strains could be separated quite well and assembled into different contigs. For an ANI of more than 99%, consensus contigs of strains were produced that mostly aligned similarly well to either reference genome. In the &#8220;twilight zone&#8221; of 95&#8211;99% nucleotide identity, assembly performance dropped substantially and MEGAHIT&#8217;s inability to reliable phase strain variation resulted in many small (and often redundant) contigs. For IDBA-UD [56], another de Bruijn graph-based metagenome assembler, a similar pattern has been observed [57], indicating that such behavior is common to many assemblers.Resolving strains from metagenome shotgun data is an open research question, though recently promising computational approaches were proposed [11, 58]. The hybrid long- and short-read simulated data sets we are providing for mouse gut and human body sites could enable the development of new approaches for this task. CAMISIM will facilitate the generation of further realistic benchmarking data sets to assess their performances. With the advent of long-read metagenomics, metagenomics software needs to coevolve, e.g., metagenome assemblers should support long-read and hybrid assemblies in the future (metaSPAdes [19] is a pioneer in this regard). In fact, hybrid data sets will be key to the second CAMI challenge [59].CAMISIM can also be used to study the effect of experimental design (e.g., number of replicates, sequencing depth, insert sizes) or intrinsic community properties, such as taxonomic composition, community abundance distributions, and organismal complexities, on program performance. Due to the enormous diversity of naturally occurring microbial communities, experimental and sequencing technology setups used in the field, such explorations are required to determine the most effective combinations for specific research questions.While we tried to mimic naturally occurring data sets as close as possible, CAMISIM, especially in the de novo mode and when artificially simulating new strains, requires the user to make choices about the underlying evolutionary and ecological parameters. This includes but is not necessarily limited to the organismal abundance distribution and its parameters, like discussed in [29, 30, 32], of microbial communities and the parameters driving strain evolution. When developing metagenome analysis tools, these should not only be entirely optimized to work on individual data sets produced by CAMISIM, but also tested with additional, optimally real world data.\nAvailability and requirements\nProject name: CAMISIM\nProject home page:\nhttps://github.com/CAMI-challenge/CAMISIM\nOperating system(s): UNIXProgramming language: Python 2.7\nOther requirements:\nhttps://github.com/CAMI-challenge/CAMISIM/wiki\nLicense: Apache 2.0Any restrictions to use by non-academics: None.\nAdditional file\n\nNone\n\nAdditional file 1Supplementary information.

(Lamiaceae) have been widely used as herbal tea called &#8220;cat's whiskers or Java tea&#8221; in Asian and European countries. The herb is widely distributed in Southeast Asian countries, particularly Malaysia, Indonesia, and China. Leaves of the herb have been traditionally used for the treatment of variety of ailments including cancer, arthritis, hypertension, and renal stones [1]. It is reported that the herb has dynamic pharmacological properties including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antibacterial properties [2]. The extracts of O. stamineus have been shown to be exceptionally safe with no signs of toxicity in vivo [3]. Antitumour studies have shown that solvent extract of O. stamineus leaves inhibited human colon tumour in nude mouse xenograft model [4, 5]. Detailed chemical analysis has shown the presence of active principle such as rosmarinic acid, sinensetin, eupatorin, and 3&#8242;-hydroxy-5,6,7,4&#8242;-tetramethoxyflavone [5]. It is suggested that the in vivo antitumor efficacy of the solvent extracts could be due to the collective contribution of antioxidant-rich phytochemicals [4].When dealing with the extraction of botanical products, the key issues for both researchers and pharmaceutical companies are the effect of the extraction process on the nutritional or active medicinal components, including their toxicity and the residues of solvent. Conventional extraction methods have some disadvantages such as the long extraction time, the inconsistent temperatures that affects the active compounds, and the use of chemical solvents and the residual solvents in the final product. Thus, nowadays supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) is found worthwhile in the extraction of natural products. Supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) is the best alternative method which employs CO2 as an extraction solvent. It is inexpensive and environment-friendly as it can be recycled. It is nontoxic and safe with no residual solvents in the extract [6]. The additional advantage of this technique is that it uses a low temperature for extraction which helps to prevent sample degradation [7]. Similarly, a number of studies have reported the advantages of SC-CO2 in extraction of active compounds from medicinal herbs [8].To our knowledge, so far, there have been no reports on the effect of SC-CO2 on extraction yield and cytotoxicity of O. stamineus leaves extracts. Thus, in the present work, an attempt was made to optimize the different extraction conditions using supercritical fluid extraction method to obtain the maximum yield of the extract of O. stamineus leaves with potent antioxidant activity. The extracts were tested for antiproliferative property against a panel of human cancer cell lines. Further a series of investigations were conducted on prostate cancer cell line to elucidate the mechanism of action. Chemometric analysis of the SC-CO2 extracts was studied using UV, FTIR, and GC-MS to correlate the potential biological activity with the chemical composition.\n2. Materials and Methods\n\n2.1. Plant Material and Reagents\nLeaves of O. stamineus were collected from the botanical garden, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM), in March 2013. The floral characteristics of O. stamineus were studied and confirmed by the Senior Botanist Mr. Shanmugan, School of Biological Sciences, USM. The herbarium specimen (Voucher number: 11009) was deposited at the herbarium of School of Biology, Universiti Sains Malaysia. Commercial liquid carbon dioxide gas with purity of 99&#8201;g&#8201;kg&#8722;1 in a gas cylinder at a temperature below &#8722;5&#176;C was supplied locally from Malaysian Oxygen Company, Penang, Malaysia. Analytical GC-grade n-hexane, absolute (99.9%) ethanol (Fisher Scientific, Loughborough, UK) and MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Germany. DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, Germany. All chemicals used were either HPLC or analytical grade. Human caspases 3/7, caspase 8, and caspase 9 FAM FLICA kits and Hoechst 33342 and Rhodamine 123 stains were purchased from Immunochemistry Technologies (Minnesota, USA).\n2.2. Cell Culture and Cell Lines\nHuman colorectal carcinoma (HCT 116), hormone sensitive and invasive breast cancer (MCF-7), hormone resistant breast cancer (MDA-MB-231), prostate carcinoma (PC-3), and human normal fibroblast (CCD-18Co) cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Rockville, MD, USA. Cells were cultured at 5% CO2-humidifed atmosphere at 37&#176;C in growth medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (HIFBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (PS). HCT 116 and MCF7 cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 and MEM media, respectively. PC-3 and CCD-18Co cells were cultured in F-12K and MDA-MB-231 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 5% HIFBS and PS.\n2.3. Supercritical Carbon Dioxide (SC-CO\nThe SC-CO2 extraction was conducted using a supercritical fluid extractor SFX 220 (ISCO, Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA; model SFX 220) with 2&#8201;mL extractor vessel capacity. The flow rates for liquid CO2 were fixed at 1.5&#8201;mL/min. All variables (extraction time, pressure temperature) and CO2 flow rates were adjusted. General factorial design of three variable multilevels was applied with thirty-six runs to investigate the operating parameters that influence the supercritical extraction condition of O. stamineus tea leaves to obtain the highest yield. One gram powder of O. stamineus leaves (500&#8201;&#956;m in diameter) was placed into the extractor vessel. The extraction was then performed under various experimental conditions in accordance with the full factorial design. The first independent variable studied was extraction pressure (MPa) at three various levels (20.7, 31.1, and 41.4&#8201;MPa). The second independent variable was temperature with three levels (40, 60, and 80&#176;C). Time is the third variable with four levels (15, 30, 45, and 60&#8201;min). The yield was recorded at each design point. Extraction was carried out at all the design points and each extraction was run in three replicates. The extracts were collected and weighed to calculate the percentage yield and stored at &#8722;20&#176;C until further use.\n2.4. Characterization and Phytochemical Analysis\n\n2.4.1. FTIR\nFTIR spectra were recorded at wavelength range from 4000 to 400&#8201;cm&#8722;1 using Thermo-Nicolet Nexus 670 spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, USA) equipped with OMNIC application software (Thermo, Electron Corporation, USA).\n2.4.2. UV-Vis Spectrophotometry\nUV-Vis spectrophotometry was carried out using Lambda25 UV/Vis spectrophotometer system operated with UV WinLab V2.85 software (Perkin Elmer, USA). Samples were prepared in methanol at 100&#8201;&#956;g/mL and were scanned at the wavelength range from 500 to 200&#8201;nm.\n2.4.3. Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectroscopy (GC-MS) Analysis\nQuantitative chemical analysis of the SC-CO2 extracts was carried out using GC-MS with an aim to characterize the compound or group of compounds that might be responsible for the observed proapoptotic activity. The assay conditions were as follows: HP-5MS capillary column (30&#8201;m &#215; 0.25&#8201;mm ID &#215; 0.25&#8201;&#956;m, film thickness); held at 70&#176;C for 2&#8201;min, raised to 285&#176;C at a rate of 20&#176;C/minute, and held for 20&#8201;min; 285&#176;C for MSD transfer line heater; carrier helium at a flow rate of 1.2&#8201;mL/minute; 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 split ratio. 1&#8201;&#956;L solution of the extract in chloroform (10&#8201;mg/mL) was injected automatically. Scan parameter low mass: 35 and higher mass: 550. The constituents were identified by comparison with standards using NIST 02. A total ion chromatogram (TIC) was used to compute the percentage of the identified constitutes.\n2.5. Assessment of Antioxidant Activities\n\n2.5.1. DPPH Radical Scavenging Activity\nDPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) assay [9] was carried out to evaluate the scavenging activity of SC-CO2 extracts.\n2.5.2. ABTS Assay\nFree radical scavenging capability of the extracts was assessed using ABTS assay following the method described by Khadeer Ahamed and coworkers [9].\n2.6. In Vitro Anticancer Studies\n\n2.6.1. Antiproliferation MTT Assay\nMTT assay [10] was performed to assess the cytotoxicity of the SFE extracts on various cancer cell lines (HCT 116, MCF 7, PC-3, and MDA-MB-231). Human colonic fibroblast (CCD-18Co) was used as the model cell line for normal cell. The assay plates were read using Tecan microplate reader (Infinite M 200 PRO) at 570&#8201;nm absorbance. DMSO (0.1%) was used as a negative control.\n2.6.2. Cell Migration Assay\nFor cell migration assay [11], PC3 cells were seeded and incubated for 48&#8201;h to achieve fully confluent (90&#8211;100%) monolayer.\n2.6.3. Colony Formation Assay\nEffect of B2 on clonogenicity of PC3 cells was investigated by colony formation assay [12]. The anticlonogenicity of the B2 was estimated in the form of percentage of plating efficiency (PE%) and percentage of surviving fraction (SF%).\n2.6.4. Determination of Nuclear Condensation by Hoechst 33342 Stain\nEffect of B2 on nuclear chromatin condensation in PC3 cells was quantified by fluorescence microscopy using Hoechst 33258 stain [13].\n2.6.5. Detection of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential by Rhodamine 123 Stain\nDetection of the changes in mitochondrial membrane potential in PC3 cells treated with B2 was assessed by the retention of rhodamine 123 [14].\n2.6.6. Caspase Inhibition Assay\nThe activity of caspases 3/7, caspase 8, and caspase 9 in PC3 cells treated with B2 was detected using the carboxyfluorescein FLICA apoptosis detection kit [15] following the manufacturer's instructions (Immunochemistry Technologies, LLC). The percent of caspase induction (CI) was calculated.\n2.7. Statistical Analysis\nAll the results were subjected to ANOVA tests. The responses, the yields, the antioxidant activity, and the proliferative activity of the SC-CO2 extractions were compared at 5% significance level. The statistical analysis was conducted using Minitab 16 software (Minitab Inc., State College, PA, USA).\n3. Results\n\n3.1. Effect of SC-CO\nEffects of extract time, temperature, and pressure were studied on the yield and biological activity of the extracts. Cumulative percentage yield of SC-CO2 extracts of O. stamineus leaves was calculated at intervals of 15&#8201;min. The percentage yield increased significantly with increasing extraction time (P < 0.05). The results indicate that 60&#8201;min is the optimum extraction time for maximum yield of the extract of O. stamineus leaves by SC-CO2 (Figure 1(a)).Cumulative percentage yield of the extracts was estimated at intervals of 20&#176;C and approximate 10&#8201;MPa pressure.  Figure 1(b) shows the interaction between temperature and pressure. The extraction temperature showed a negative correlation with the percentage yield at 40, 60, and 80&#176;C with decreasing order of R\n2, respectively, whereas the extraction pressure showed significantly (P < 0.05) positive correlation with the percentage yield at 20.7, 31.1, and 41.4 MPa with R\n2 0.92, 0.95, and 0.96, respectively (Table 1).  Figure 1(c) shows the behavior of two factors (pressure and temperature) separately and their effect on the extraction yield. It can be seen that the two factors have significant effect on the extraction yield. The results of ANOVA analysis exhibited that the effect of these parameters was significant on yield of extraction P < 0.05.The results showed that the pressure increment has enhanced the extraction yield at all tested temperatures (Figure 1(d)). At a fixed extraction temperature of 40&#176;C, increasing the pressure from 20.7 to 41.4&#8201;MPa has increased the extraction yield from 0.71 to 0. 87%, respectively. However, it was found that the extraction rate was enhanced 47% at extraction temperature of 60&#176;C. Figure 1(d) depicts that the extraction yield increased significantly from 0.76 to 1.74% with increasing pressure from 20.7 to 41.4&#8201;MPa, respectively. Likewise, at a fixed extraction temperature of 80&#176;C, the extraction yield increased from 0.6% to 0.73 by increasing the pressure from 20.7 to 41.4&#8201;MPa, respectively. However, operating extraction pressure of 20.7&#8201;MPa was not very beneficial for the extraction yield. As at this extraction pressure the extraction rate at temperature of 40&#176;C was 22.5%, which then increased to 47% at extraction temperature of 60&#176;C and then abruptly dropped to 21.6% at temperature of 80&#176;C. Altogether, the highest extracted yield was 1.74% (B2 extract) which was obtained at extraction pressure of 31.1&#8201;MPa, using extraction temperature of 60&#176;C, during a period of 60&#8201;min as shown in Table 1.\n3.2. Phytochemical Study of the Extracts\n\n3.2.1. FTIR Analysis\nFTIR spectra of the extracts obtained at 60&#8201;min are shown in Figures 2(a)&#8211;2(c).  Table 2 depicts the related functional groups of transmittance bands of the corresponding wavelengths [16].\n3.2.2. UV-Vis Spectrophotometry\nThe UV spectra for the extracts A1, B1, and C1 (Figure 2(d)) displayed strong absorption bands at &#955;\nmax&#8289; 228&#8211;232&#8201;nm, the characteristic feature for a conjugated double bond, whereas the other extracts showed feeble absorption around this region (Figures 2(e) and 2(f)). Spectrum of the extract A3 showed that the extract lacks the &#960;-electrons of a double bond or a benzene ring shifts. Further the UV spectra of all extracts, except A1 and A3, showed obvious bands at &#955;\nmax&#8289; 328, 279, 213, 337, 272, 205, 332, 273, and 228&#8201;nm.\n3.3. Antioxidant Activity of the SC-CO\nDPPH and ABTS radicals scavenging activity is presented in terms of the IC50 in Table 3. It was found that the extracts produced at moderate temperatures and higher pressure (B2 and C2) showed significant antioxidant activity compared to the other extracts. The extract C2 produced at 60&#176;C and 41.4&#8201;MPa showed significant (P < 0.01) DPPH quenching activity (IC50 = 56.1&#8201;&#956;g/mL). However, the extract B2 (60&#176;C and 31.1&#8201;MPa) demonstrated more pronounced antioxidant activity than the other tested extracts. The IC50 values of B2 were 91.7 and 42.8&#8201;&#956;g/mL for ABT and DPPH, respectively (P < 0.05).\n3.4. Antiproliferative Activity of SC-CO\nAntiproliferative effect of different SC-CO2 extracts of O. stamineus on various human cell lines was tested using MTT assay. Similar to the antioxidant activities, significant (P < 0.01) antiproliferative activities have been shown from the extracts obtained under medium and high pressures. The IC50 values of the SFE extracts of O. stamineus on various human cell lines are shown in Table 4. The extracts (B2, C1, C2, and C3) prepared at high pressures demonstrated considerable cytotoxic activity against PC3 cell line. The IC50 values of C1, C2, and C3 were 79, 78, and 73&#8201;&#956;g/mL, respectively, on PC3 cells. However, among all the extracts, B2 displayed more pronounced antiproliferative effect against PC3 with IC50 28&#8201;&#956;g/mL. In addition, B2 and C1 exhibited significant (P < 0.05) antiproliferative effect against breast (MDA-MB-231) cell line with IC50 57.8 and 53&#8201;&#956;g/mL, respectively (Table 3).  Figure 3 shows the dose-dependent antiproliferative effects of B2, C1, C2, and C3 on MCF7 (Figure 3(a)), MDA-MB-231 (Figure 3(b)), PC-3 (Figure 3(c)), and HCT 116 (Figure 3(d)) cell lines.  Figure 4 shows that the photomicrographic images of the treated PC3 and MDA-MB-231 cells presented clear evidence of significant cytotoxicity of the extracts, as the vehicle (0.1% DMSO) treated cells displayed a compact monolayer of aggressively growing cancer cells with prominent nuclei and intact cell membrane, whereas the images taken form the extracts treated group showed a drastic reduction in the number of cells because of the antiproliferative activity of the extracts. In addition, the extracts severely affected the pseudopodial projections of the cells which rendered the cells non-adherent and become round shaped. Interestingly, all the extracts studied showed either mild or negligible cytotoxicity towards the CCD-18Co cell line which was used as a model cell line for the normal human cells.Overall result of cytotoxic test on the human cancer cell lines displayed that the extract B2 demonstrated potent cytotoxicity selectively towards the PC3 cell line as the IC50 obtained is much lower than that of other cell lines. Therefore, in the present study, PC3 cell line is selected to study the effect of B2 on the motility, clonogenicity, morphological modifications, nuclear condensation, mitochondrial membrane potential, and induction of caspases in PC3 cells.\n3.5. Inhibitory Effect of B2 on Migration and Clonogenicity of PC3 Cells\nB2 demonstrated dose- and time-dependent inhibitory effect on migration of PC3 cells. B2 displayed significant inhibition in cell motility (Figure 5(a)) at the concentration lower than its IC50 on PC3 cells. The percentage of wound closure calculated after 12&#8201;h was 29 &#177; 3, 18 &#177; 5, and 5 &#177; 3% at 12, 25, and 50&#8201;&#956;g/mL (P < 0.05). Even after 12&#8201;h the percentage of wound closure was significantly inhibited by B2. Figure 5(b) graphically illustrates the potent inhibitory effect of B2 on motility of PC3 cells which can be compared with the standard reference, betulinic acid.The dose-dependent inhibitory effect of B2 on colony formation of PC3 cells was depicted in Figure 5(c). Percentage of plating efficiency (PE) in vehicle (0.1% DMSO) treated cells was 58 &#177; 2% which was drastically decreased to 30 &#177; 4, 28 &#177; 2, and 23 &#177; 3% upon treatment with B2 at 12, 25, and 50&#8201;&#956;g/mL, respectively (Figure 5(d)). The surviving fraction (SF) was determined to be 58 &#177; 3, 53 &#177; 3, and 45 &#177; 2% after B2 treatment at the concentrations 12, 25, and 50&#8201;&#956;g/mL, respectively (Figure 5(e)). These results can be compared with the standard reference, betulinic acid.\n3.6. B2 Induces Morphological Modifications and Nuclear Condensation in PC3 Cells\nIn the present study, the effect of B2 on PC3 cells was tested to study morphological modifications and nuclear condensation using Hoechst 33342 stain. Microscopic examination revealed that B2 induced the typical apoptotic morphological changes in PC3 cells in a dose-dependent fashion (Figure 6(a)). Nevertheless, the cells from vehicle (0.1% DMSO) group demonstrated regular architecture of monolayer of PC3 cells with prominent nuclei and intact cell membrane. After 12&#8201;hr of B2 treatment, the condensation of nucleus and dissolution of chromatin can be seen clearly in the cytoplasm. At high concentration of B2 (40&#8201;&#956;g/mL), the cells displayed shrunken and crescent shaped nuclei with discrete chromatin bodies which are the characteristic features of advanced stage of apoptosis. The percentage of apoptosis index estimated for negative control was 4 &#177; 0.02% which was significantly increased after the treatment (Figure 6(b)). However, the apoptotic indices for the cells treated with B2 were significantly increased to 19 &#177; 1 and 36 &#177; 3% at 12 and 25&#8201;&#956;g/mL concentrations, respectively (Figure 6(b)). Positive control group treated with betulinic acid (10&#8201;&#956;g/mL) showed remarkable apoptosis with 43% apoptotic index.\n3.7. Treatment of B2 Reduced Mitochondrial Membrane Potential in PC3 Cells\nThe cells were exposed to rhodamine 123 after 12&#8201;hr of treatment and the intensity of rhodamine in the cells was observed (Figure 6(a)). Results of the present study showed an obvious intensification of fluorescence in the untreated cells; however, the signal significantly (P < 0.01) dropped in the cells treated with B2, which proposes the damage in mitochondrial membrane and decrease in membrane potential. The dose-dependent effect was evident from the apoptotic indices calculated which were 31 &#177; 2 and 63 &#177; 4% after the treatment with B2 at 12 and 25&#8201;&#956;g/mL, respectively (Figure 6(b)). The result can be compared to that of betulinic acid (10&#8201;&#956;g/mL) which caused 77 &#177; 5% apoptotic index.\n3.8. Inhibitory Effect of B2 on Caspases\nIn the present study, the activity of caspases 3/7, caspase 8, and caspase 9 was detected in B2-treated PC3 cells by fluorescence microplate reader and fluorescence microscopy using the carboxyfluorescein FLICA apoptosis detection kit. The fluorescent intensity in the photomicrographic images of the PC3 cells (Figure 7(a)) shows the induction of caspase activities. The results of the present study demonstrated that B2 caused significant induction of caspases 3/7 and caspase 9 activities. In addition, considerable activation of caspases 8 was also detected (Figure 7(a)).  Figure 7(b) illustrates the quantitative estimation of caspase induction caused by B2 in comparison with positive control, betulinic acid.\n3.9. GC-MS Analytical Report\nThe extract B2 was analysed using GC-MS to specify and quantify the major chemical constituents present in it.  Figure 8 depicts the GC-MS of B2. The pie chart in Figure 8 illustrates the composition and proportion of the major chemical constituents in the extract. Detailed characteristics of the peaks identified in the GC-MS (Figure 8) were presented in Table 5.\n4. Discussion\nSupercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) extraction method is an attractive and more advanced technology than the conventional solvent extraction methods. SC-CO2 is nonexplosive, nontoxic, inexpensive, and able to solubilize lipophilic substances [17, 18]. Carbon dioxide has been shown to ensure minimal alteration of the bioactive compounds and thereby it preserves the native chemical properties of the compounds and thus the curative and functional properties of the compounds will be retained [19]. Therefore, SC-CO2 extraction method gives the extracts with better biological activity than the conventional extractions methods. Moreover, CO2 is gaseous at room temperature and pressure, which makes the phytochemicals recovery very easy and simple and provides solvent-free extracts. In addition, CO2 is environment-friendly and generally recognized as safe by the Food and Drug Administration and European Food Safety Authority.In the present study, a full factorial design of 3 &#215; 3 &#215; 4 was carried out with total number of thirty six runs in order to determine the best extraction conditions in terms of extraction yield and antiproliferative and antioxidant properties. The findings of the present study revealed that the percentage yield of the extract was time and pressure dependent and thus the percentage yield increased significantly with increasing pressure and time (P < 0.05). In contrast, the percentage yield was noted to be temperature independent. However, the extraction yield was increased with increasing pressure at a fixed extraction temperature. This increment is due to the fact that high pressure increases the density of a supercritical fluid that consequently enhances the solubilizing capability of organic compounds and ultimately helps in dissolving large quantities of the phytoconstituents [20]. On the other hand, temperature poses an opposite effect on the density of SC-CO2 and therefore the density of SC-CO2 decreases with increasing extraction temperature at a given operating pressure. This results in reduced solvating power of CO2 which then affects the solubility of the compounds and decreases the extraction efficiency [20]. This could be the reason for the variant effects of temperature on the extraction yield.Analysis of UV-Vis spectroscopic data indicates a highly polyene nature of the phytoconstituents. Particularly, the extracts A2, B1, B2, B3, C1, C2, and C3 showed clear characteristic peaks for prenyl flavone skeleton compounds such as sinensetin, eupatorin, and tetramethoxyflavone, which are the characteristic markers of O. stamineus. FTIR spectral analysis of the extracts obtained from high temperatures revealed the prominent and broad signals which correspond to the hydroxyl groups. This clearly indicates that the extracts are rich in hydroxyl groups. Usually, polar compounds possess at least one terminal hydroxyl (&#8211;OH) group which makes them hydrophilic and therefore less volatile. On the other hand, the extracts obtained at moderate pressure (31.1&#8201;MPa) showed IR absorption frequencies corresponding to the olefinic carbon double bonds, which indicates the abundance of unsaturated phytochemicals such as phenolics, flavonoids, and other aromatic compounds.The findings of the cytotoxic activity showed that, out of 9 extracts studied, B2 (prepared at 31.1&#8201;MPa and 60&#176;C) showed selective antiproliferation activity against prostate cancer (PC3) cells. Interestingly, either negligible or insignificant cytotoxic effect of B2 was recorded on other tested cancer cells including the normal CCD-18Co cells. The cytotoxic effect of the B2 against the cancer cells could probably be due to its antioxidant-rich polyphenolic contents. This was further supported by the results of the antioxidant assays. In the present study, the extract B2 demonstrated noticeable scavenging activity against both the tested free radicals, ABTS and DPPH. The characteristic chemical markers of O. stamineus such as caffeic acid derivatives, polymethoxylated flavonoids, terpenes, and phenolics are well studied antioxidant compounds with potent cytotoxicity [21]. It has been reported that the abundant presence of methoxylated flavonoids (eupatorin and sinensetin) in O. stamineus imparts the cytotoxic property to the extract. Eupatorin was reported as a potent inhibitor for in vitro proliferation of breast cancer cells [22], while sinensetin was reported to inhibit the growth of gastric cancer cells and induces apoptosis [23].In order to characterise the cytotoxicity induced by B2 in PC3 cells, a series of assays were conducted to get deeper insights into its mode of action. During tumorigenesis, the tumor cells continue their proliferation and migration into the secondary site which leads to metastasis. This is based on the migration and colonization of the tumor cells [24]. B2 suppressed colonization of PC3 cells in a dose-dependent manner. It is noteworthy that B2 demonstrated cytotoxic effect at high concentration (50&#8201;&#956;g/mL) and caused irreversible damage to the cell integrity; however, at low concentration (12&#8201;&#956;g/mL) B2 displayed cytostatic effect. The anticlonogenic results indicated that B2 is cytotoxic at high concentration while cytostatic at its low concentration, as evident by decrease of survival fraction. Colonization and migration are the critical processes to promote tumorigenesis and metastasis. In this study, inhibition of migration and colony formation of PC3 cells in vitro by B2 suggests that the extract could probably inhibit cell metastasis [25]. This indicates that the extract has potential to block the motility of the prostate cancer cells.Apoptotic cells undergo a series of characteristic morphological and biochemical changes, which usually manifest themselves as nuclear condensation, DNA fragmentation, and chromatin dissolution [13]. In this study, Hoechst-stained images of B2-treated PC3 cells revealed clear proapoptotic signs such as chromatin condensation and dissolution. High concentration of B2 rendered the cells with crescent shaped nuclei, a characteristic feature of advanced stage of apoptosis.To confirm the apoptosis induced by B2 in PC3 cells involved the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and integrity in the cells, the effect was assessed by visualizing the uptake of rhodamine 123 by mitochondria. Rhodamine 123 is the lipophilic dye which can be readily absorbed into the mitochondria of live cells [26]. Disturbance in mitochondrial membrane potential (&#916;&#936;) is a clear indication of early apoptotic stage [27]. Uptake of rhodamine 123 by the cells decreases exponentially with decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential, and consequently the intensity of florescent also decreases. The photomicrographic images of B2-treated PC3 cells revealed remarkable reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential, a sign of apoptosis induction.The proapoptotic effect of B2 on DNA and mitochondria was further confirmed by measuring the caspases activity in PC3 cells. Caspases are a group of intracellular cysteine proteases that promote apoptosis in the cells. Caspase 9 is an initiator caspase activated by mitochondria via intrinsic pathway. After getting activated, caspase 9 subsequently activates a series of &#8220;effector caspases,&#8221; caspases 3/7, and ultimately the cascade ends with cellular death [28]. However, caspase 8 is an executioner caspase and activated by extrinsic pathway.The overall result demonstrates that the extract B2 at subcytotoxic concentration (10&#8201;&#956;g/mL) caused apoptosis which appears to be chiefly associated with the early activation of caspase 9 through mitochondrial pathway, as confirmed by the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential in Rhodamine 123 assay. The activation of the mitochondrial pathway may in turn induce caspase 8, eventually resulting in a feedback amplification of caspase 9. Caspases 3 and 7 are the executioner enzymes and their activation results into the nuclear condensation and degradation which further supports the findings of Hoechst stain assay on nuclear condensation and dissolution.The proapoptotic effect of B2 was further supported by the GC-MS analysis. The major chemical constituents present in the extract were identified using the NIST library. Predominantly, the spectra of B2 showed presence of several biologically dynamic phytoconstituents such as the derivatives of anthracene, hydronaphthalen, and azulenone. Among the identified compounds, anthracene derivatives were reported to possess promising antitumor activity by binding, intercalating, and fragmenting DNA in cancer cells [29&#8211;31]. However, the other major compounds identified in B2 such as acetic acid (3-hydroxy-7-isopropenyl-1,4a-dimethyl-octahydronaphthalen-2-yl) ester and dimethyl-4-(1-methylethylidene)-2,4,6,7,8,8a-hexahydro-5(1H)-azulenone were reported as the major chemical composition of the extracts with considerable biological activities including cytotoxic properties [32, 33].\n5. Conclusion\nIn the present study, a general factorial experiment of type 3 &#215; 3 &#215; 4 was used with total number of thirty-six runs to prepare supercritical CO2 (SC-CO2) extracts of cat's whiskers tea (Orthosiphon stamineus). The SC-CO2 extract prepared at moderate pressure and temperature (31.1&#8201;MPa and 60&#176;C) produced selective cytotoxicity against human prostate cancer (PC3) cells and significant free radical scavenging activity, while being nontoxic to normal cells. Further investigation provided good evidence that the extract displayed proapoptotic, antimetastatic, and anticlonogenic effects in PC3 cells, which could be due to the collective contribution of phytochemicals, particularly, aldehyde, hydrocarbon, ketone, fatty acids, esters, and aromatic sesquiterpenes such as acetic acid (3-hydroxy-7-isopropenyl-1,4a-dimethyl-octahydronaphthalen-2-yl) ester, dimethyl-4-(1-methylethylidene)-2,4,6,7,8,8a-hexahydro-5(1H)-azulenone, anthracene, 9-(2-propenyl), 2-propen-1-one, 1,3-diphenyl, and 2-amino-2-oxo-acetic acid N-(3,4-dimethylphenyl) ethyl ester. Thus, the bioactive extract of cat's whiskers tea prepared using an inexpensive and environment-friendly supercritical CO2 could be a valuable bioresource with anticancer potential against prostate malignancy.", "pmid": "25276215", "title": "Optimization of Cat's Whiskers Tea (Orthosiphon stamineus) Using Supercritical Carbon Dioxide and Selective Chemotherapeutic Potential against Prostate Cancer Cells", "journal_title": "Evidence-based Complementary and Alternative Medicine : eCAM", "authors": "Fouad Saleih R.

Here we test whether PA is associated with altered prefrontal monitoring functions that could adjust nociceptive processing to a mismatch between expected and experienced pain. We recorded event-related potentials to response errors in a go/nogo task during placebo vs. a matched control condition. Error commission was associated with two well-described components, the error-related negativity (ERN) and the error positivity (Pe). Results show that the Pe, but not the ERN, was amplified during placebo analgesia compared to the control condition, with neural sources in the lateral and medial PFC. This Pe increase was driven by participants showing a placebo-induced change in pain tolerance, but was absent in the group of non-responders. Our results shed new light on the possible functional mechanisms underlying PA, suggesting a placebo-induced transient change in prefrontal error monitoring and control functions.", "body": "Introduction\nPlacebo analgesia (PA) refers to a reduced pain sensation due to the belief in an otherwise non-effective treatment [1], [2]. During the last decade, advances have been made in understanding the neurophysiological mechanisms and psychological processes underlying the generation and maintenance of PA. Converging neuroimaging evidence demonstrates that placebo effects are accompanied by decreases of pain-related brain activation in the so-called &#8216;pain matrix&#8217; [3], [4], [5], [6]. Such decreases are consistently paralleled by increased activity in other regions, such as lateral and medial prefrontal cortex (LPFC and MPFC) &#8211; both during PA [3], [4], [7], [8] and as early as during expectation of relief, before actual pain stimulation [4], [6]. However, thus far there is no conclusive evidence regarding the functional role of these prefrontal areas in PA [9]. Several authors have suggested that LPFC activations during PA reflect a recruitment of cognitive control mechanisms that could in turn trigger opioidergic changes in the descending pain inhibitory system (e.g. [6], [9], [10], [11], [12]). Here we address the question of whether PA could be intertwined with a key function of prefrontal cognitive control networks, namely error processing.In line with this hypothesis, previous research has shown that the expectation of pain relief is crucial for the implementation of the analgesic response [10]. In their seminal study, Wager et al. [6] reported enhanced activations in LPFC and MPFC, along with orbitofrontal regions during the anticipation of immediate pain administration under PA. Remarkably, brain activity in these cognitive control regions, including LPFC, MPFC, and parietal regions, predicted inter-individual differences in placebo responses [13]. Further, transient and reversible inhibition of LPFC by means of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) was found to prevent PA, suggesting a causal role of this cognitive control region for the implementation of placebo analgesia [12].We reasoned that the functional role of prefrontal cognitive control regions such as LPFC and MPFC during maintenance of PA may be related to the monitoring and the regulation of upcoming nociceptive input. During PA, the brain has to adjust to a mismatch between predicted pain and actual nociceptive input (i.e. a prediction error). PA may thus require two complementary processes, which are also crucial for error monitoring, and central to cognitive control in general [14], [15], [16]: first, PA probably requires monitoring of prediction errors between expected and actual nociceptive signals, and second, subsequent adjustments in top-down control of neural processing (see Fig. 1). Strikingly, the specific brain regions showing enhanced activation during placebo analgesia, most notably medial and lateral PFC areas, were previously associated with these particular functions (e.g. [17]). Several influential theoretical accounts of cognitive control converge in their proposition that MPFC is crucial for the monitoring of conflicts, prediction errors, and other negative or at least surprising events that require adjustments in cognitive control [14], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22]. The necessary subsequent adjustments in top-down control are thought to be implemented in more lateral prefrontal regions [14], [17]. In light of this model, we reasoned that if the implementation of PA depends on the same prefrontal brain mechanisms as more general control processes, then PA may in turn also exert influences on error processing brain processes (see Fig. 1).Previous electrophysiological studies have identified event-related potentials (ERPs) specifically associated with early error detection. Response errors typically induce a large negative ERP component (termed the error-related negativity, or ERN) peaking within the first 100 ms following response onset over frontocentral scalp electrode positions [23], [24]. It is commonly assumed that the ERN reflects an automatic conflict or prediction error signal generated in the MPFC [19], [23], [25], [26]. The ERN is followed by the error positivity (Pe), a large positive deflection peaking between 100&#8211;300 ms with a more central scalp topography [27], [28], [29], [30]. The Pe appears to be generated by similar MPFC regions as the ERN, as well as additional sources, including the LPFC, insula, and orbitofrontal cortex [31], [32]. ERN and Pe are often found to be functionally dissociated [28]. Whereas the ERN is thought to reflect a generic error/conflict detection process based on internal motor representations [14], [19], [33], the functional significance of the Pe is related to more elaborate stages of error processing, including subsequent adjustments in behavioral control and awareness of error commission [27], [28], [33], [34], [35], [36].If the assumption holds true that PA is based on cognitive mechanisms that functionally overlap with cognitive control processes related to conflict monitoring, one would expect PA to have a direct influence on such electrophysiological markers of error processing. The goal of our study was to test whether PA may be associated with specific changes in the aforementioned monitoring processes. On the one hand, one may hypothesize that PA may decrease error-related brain responses, as they are generated by mediofrontal mechanisms that may also be sensitive to negative affect, pain, and &#8211;more generally&#8211; need for control [21]. Yet, it has been shown that the effects of PA are usually quite selective regarding the specific instructions about the treatment effects. For example, only the hand upon which &#8220;analgesic&#8221; cream is applied showed reduced pain sensitivity and was associated with reduced ACC activity, but not so for the opposing hand [6]. Therefore, it appears unlikely that PA reduces negative affect in general &#8211; unless participants were directly instructed that this is what the treatment does (see e.g. [37]).Alternatively, we predict that PA amplifies error-related brain potentials during the expectation of analgesic effects. This hypothesis is based on accumulating evidence showing that increased activity in medial and lateral prefrontal areas, which are crucial for cognitive control and regulation of emotion, is predictive for the installation of analgesic effects [6], [9], [10], [12], [13].Participants were tested using a randomized cross-over within-subject design. They were led to believe that a single (inert) dose of a capsule ingested at the beginning of the experiment was either a reliable painkiller (placebo condition) or an ineffective pill (control condition). Pain threshold and tolerance were measured at the beginning and at the end of each experimental session to quantify the individual placebo response to a standard thermal pain administration on the forearm. During the experimental session, 64-channel EEG was recorded while participants performed a speeded go/nogo task and occasionally committed unwanted response errors (i.e. false alarms on nogo stimuli). This enabled us to characterize error-related brain activities during PA versus a perfectly matched control condition, using a within-subject design. Based on the hypothesis that common brain areas underlie both PA and error monitoring (see Fig. 1), we predicted that PA would have an amplifying effect on these ERP components specifically related to error detection.\nMaterials and Methods\n\nParticipants\nTwenty healthy undergraduates from Ghent University (14 women; all right-handed as determined by self-report; mean age 21.2 years; range 18&#8211;31) participated in two experimental sessions (placebo and control), both taking place at the same time on two consecutive days. Session order was counterbalanced across participants. In order to enhance the plausibility of the cover story, the experimenter was wearing a white medical coat and conducted a brief interview at the beginning of the first session, in which participants were thoroughly screened for any history of serious physical, mental, or neurological illness, for pain-related disorders, allergies, and current medication. Two female participants had to be excluded from the analysis, one because she did not believe in the cover story used to induce PA, and another for reporting that she did not experience any temperature increase during thermal pain stimulation. Accordingly, the final sample contained 18 na&#239;ve participants. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the ethics committee of the Faculty of Psychological and Educational Sciences, Ghent University. All participants gave informed written consent, and were compensated 40&#8364;.\nStimuli and Task\nThe speeded go/nogo task used in our study has been extensively described elsewhere [29], [30], [32], [38], [39]. Each trial started with a central fixation cross (presented for 1 s) followed by a black arrow that changed color after a randomly jittered interval of 1&#8211;2 s. In two thirds of the trials (go-trials), the arrow turned green, indicating that participants should respond as quickly as possible by pressing the space bar. In the remaining third of trials (nogo), the arrow turned either cyan (instead of green) or turned green, but changed direction (relative to the black arrow), indicating participants had to withhold their response. One second after the response, feedback was given in the form of an isoluminant green or red dot for correct versus incorrect responses, respectively. In order to increase commission errors, only fast responses, as determined by calibrating an individual RT limit updated on a trial-by-trial basis [29], [30] were classified as correct. This imposed speed pressure promoted the occurrence of many responses errors, allowing for reliable error-related ERP waveforms in each condition. Each of the six blocks consisted of 60 trials (40 go and 20 nogo), resulting in 360 trials in total (&#8764;30 min).\nApparatus\nPainful thermal stimulation and threshold tests were administered using a MSA Thermotest device (SOMEDIC Sales AB, Sweden), with the thermode placed on the left or right volar forearm, and controlled using the manufacturer&#8217;s software. The experiment took place in an electromagnetically shielded, dimly lit chamber, with participants seated 80 cm in front of a computer screen. Stimulus presentation was controlled using E-Prime 2.0 software.\nProcedure and Measures\n\nPlacebo induction\nVolunteers were told they were taking part in a study investigating the effects of a widely used painkiller on EEG activity during an &#8220;attention task.&#8221; Prior to the experiment, participants read an information sheet about the medication, its analgesic properties (&#8220;highly effective in reducing pain on many body parts, including heat pain&#8221;), the onset (&#8220;about 11 minutes after oral administration&#8221;), and duration (&#8220;2&#8211;4 hours&#8221;) of these effects. Following the first pain threshold measurement, participants were given a capsule containing 160 mg of Mannitol (a medically non-effective white sugar substitute) and a glass of water. They were given instructions aimed at inducing either an analgesic placebo or a neutral effect: &#8220;This is a capsule of an effective pain reliever. In 10&#8211;15 minutes the medication will be fully effective, and notably decrease your sensitivity to the thermal heat pain&#8221; (Placebo condition) or &#8220;This is a capsule without any effective drug, needed as a control. It will not decrease your sensation of pain nor induce any other effects&#8221; (Control condition).\nMeasurement of pain sensitivity\nPain tolerances and thresholds were determined at three intervals during each session (see Fig. 2A): Prior to intake of the Mannitol capsule (T1, corresponding to the baseline); after installing the EEG cap and electrodes (&#8764;20 minutes after intake), in order to establish the placebo belief (T2); and directly after the go/nogo task (T3, as a manipulation check). Thresholds were assessed by applying a steadily increasing thermal stimulation (starting at 32&#176;C, with a slope of 2&#176;C/s) to the inner wrist. On four consecutive trials (with 5 s breaks between trials), participants were instructed to press a button in order to cease the thermal stimulation, thereby terminating the trial, at the moment the sensation changed from that of heat to pain (pain threshold measure). In a further four trials, participants were requested to button press to indicate the point at which the pain became unbearable (pain tolerance measure). For each time point, both pain threshold and pain tolerance were calculated as the average temperature across the four trials. The net placebo effect upon threshold and tolerance was quantified as the difference between the differences (interaction term) of the temperatures in T3 versus T1 between placebo and control condition (T1Placebo&#8211;T3 Placebo)&#8211;(T1 Control&#8211;T3 Control). Participants did not receive feedback as to temperature values. However, in order to enhance the placebo induction, following the second threshold measurements (T2) participants were told (irrespective of the actual values): &#8220;Both your pain threshold and your pain tolerance have significantly increased.&#8221; (Placebo condition) or &#8220;Your threshold are very similar to the ones obtained in the first test.&#8221; (Control condition).Further, two single-pulse thermal stimulations, lasting 5 s, were administered at three time points for each session. Participants were informed that this stimulation served to determine subjective changes in pain intensity throughout the experiment, and were asked to rate the pain intensity of the pulse on a scale of 0&#8211;8, with 0 being no pain, and 8 being the greatest pain imaginable. The single-pulse stimulations were administered directly after the threshold and tolerance measurements for T1, but directly before measurement for T2 and T3. In all cases but one, the pulse stimulation was identical to the T1 threshold and tolerance averages; unbeknownst to the participants, we lowered the single-pulse threshold and tolerance temperatures by 1.5&#176;C in the placebo condition at T2 (immediately before the go/nogo task) in order to mimic a genuine analgesic effect of the administered pill [6].In order to assess belief in the placebo manipulation, participants indicated their expectancy of the analgesic effect of the pill they ingested following each experimental session in a questionnaire. They responded to the item &#8220;Did you expect an effect of the capsule intake on your pain sensitivity?&#8221; on a Likert-scale from 1 to 7 (Analgesia expectancy). To check for the presence of a subjectively experienced analgesic effect, we asked: &#8220;How efficient was the capsule in reducing the pain sensation when you received thermal pain?&#8221; After the second experimental session, all participants were thoroughly debriefed and screened for possible suspicion concerning the credibility of the cover story.\nAdditional Behavioral Measures\nTo control whether potential effects were mediated by mood changes or by other beliefs participants might have, we measured state anxiety at the end of each EEG session using the validated Dutch version of the STAI [40], and included two items at the end of the second session concerning the expectancy of medication-related cognitive performance increase and decrease (&#8220;Did you expect an improvement of your performance in the attention task, following the intake of the pain medication capsule?&#8221; and &#8220;Did you expect a decrease in your performance in the attention task, following the intake of the pain medication capsule?&#8221;).\nEEG Preprocessing and Analyses\nEEG was recorded from 64 electrodes with a sampling rate of 2048 Hz (ActiveTwo Biosemi system). Following standard practice, raw data were re-referenced offline to a common average and filtered (0.5&#8211;30 Hz, and 50 Hz notch). Following ocular correction using an ICA algorithm as implemented in Brain Vision Analyzer 2.0 software, the data was segmented from &#8722;500 to 1000 ms around responses, separately for fast correct hits and commission errors. Segments exceeding amplitudes of &#177;80 &#181;V were excluded prior to baseline correction and averaging. Individual average ERP waveforms were filtered using 1&#8211;30 Hz.In order to assess the time windows of error-related components in a unbiased and objective, data-driven way, we first calculated the grand average ERP waveform for errors across both placebo and control condition and identified the ERN and Pe components based on two reference-free global measures of the electric field, dissimilarity and global field power (GFP) [41]. GFP measures the overall &#8220;energy&#8221; of the electrical field on the scalp, by summing up the squared field potentials across all electrodes. Conversely, dissimilarity measures the change in the topographical distribution (irrespective of changes in the local or global strength of the ERP signal), and is therefore highly sensitive to transitions between different microstates or ERP components [41], [42], [43], [44]. ERN and Pe were identified as phases of high global field power, between local maxima of topographical dissimilarity [41], [42], [43], [44]. Thus, we extracted the ERN amplitude as the minimum value between &#8722;40 and 60 ms around response, and the Pe as the maximum between 100&#8211;280 ms, for errors and fast hits separately in the two experimental conditions (placebo versus control), at the electrode sites Fz, FCz, and Cz, where these two error-related components were found to be maximal. Slow hits were not further analyzed, as they are characterized by different RT distributions compared to fast hits or errors [29], [30].\nSource Analysis\nWe used standardized low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) [45] to estimate the neural generators underlying the increased Pe amplitude in the placebo condition (see results below). In order to deal with the inverse solution problem and restrict the number of possible solutions, sLORETA assumes maximal &#8220;smoothness&#8221; of the current density, and further restricts the possible three-dimensional solutions to 6239 points in the cortical grey matter volume. With a regularization parameter of SNR &#8202;=&#8202;10, source activity was first estimated for the individual ERPs, separately for fast hits and error trials in the placebo versus the control condition.\nStatistical Analyses\nBehavioral and ERP data were analyzed by means of repeated-measures ANOVAs or mixed-effects ANOVAs for group comparisons (placebo responders versus non-responders). Planned pairwise t-tests were Bonferroni-corrected for multiple comparisons. Statistically significant differences in the source space (sLORETA analysis) were evidenced using paired t-tests (uncorrected for multiple comparisons, given the smoothness of source activity estimation) performed on the mean activity from 100 to 280 ms after response onset (encompassing the Pe component).\nResults\n\nBehavioral\n\nManipulation check\nQuestionnaire results revealed a strong effect of placebo versus control condition on analgesia expectation (Placebo mean&#8202;=&#8202;4.61, SD&#8202;=&#8202;1.69, Control mean&#8202;=&#8202;1.33, SD&#8202;=&#8202;0.77; t(17)&#8202;=&#8202;8.1, p<0.001) and on subjectively experienced pain relief (Placebo mean 4.44, SD&#8202;=&#8202;1.04, Control mean&#8202;=&#8202;1.44, SD&#8202;=&#8202;0.51; t(17)&#8202;=&#8202;13.1, p<0.001), confirming that participants experienced a subjective pain-relieving effect of the capsule in the placebo compared to the control session.Changes in subjective pain intensity ratings (Likert scale 0&#8211;8) for the threshold temperature were tested using a repeated-measures ANOVA with the factors TIME (baseline T1 vs. T3) and CONDITION (placebo vs. control). We found a significant main effect for TIME (F(1,17)&#8202;=&#8202;8.6, p&#8202;=&#8202;0.008), but no significant main effect for CONDITION, and no significant interaction. The same statistical analysis run on the ratings obtained for the tolerance temperature revealed no main effect of CONDITION, but trends for the main effect of TIME (F(1,17)&#8202;=&#8202;4.1, p&#8202;=&#8202;0.059), as well as for the TIME&#215;CONDITION interaction (F(1,17)&#8202;=&#8202;4.1, p&#8202;=&#8202;0.058). This latter interaction was driven by a significant increase in pain intensity ratings at T3 compared to T1 in the control condition (Bonferroni-corrected t-test, p&#8202;=&#8202;0.011), which was not present for the placebo condition (p&#8202;=&#8202;1.00). The direction of the interaction effect was thus in accord with the prediction of analgesic effects following placebo beliefs.Further, we tested whether effects of PA could be supported in direct and more implicit measures of pain sensitivity, namely via changes in pain threshold and pain tolerance temperatures (see Fig. 2B). Whereas a main effect for TIME was found for both pain threshold (F(1,17)&#8202;=&#8202;9.2, p&#8202;=&#8202;0.026) and pain tolerance temperature (F(1,17)&#8202;=&#8202;10.1, p&#8202;=&#8202;0.006), the interaction CONDITION&#215;TIME yielded a trend only for the pain tolerance (F(1,17)&#8202;=&#8202;4.0, p&#8202;=&#8202;0.061), with no significant effect for the threshold (F(1,17)&#8202;=&#8202;1.3, p&#8202;=&#8202;0.28). Planned comparisons with Bonferroni-corrected t-tests confirmed that the difference between T3 and T1 (baseline) pain tolerance was significant only in the placebo condition (p&#8202;=&#8202;0.005), but not in the control condition (p&#8202;=&#8202;1.0), in line with our hypothesis. We note that, in accordance with previous studies on placebo effects [13], our sample contained substantial inter-individual variability regarding placebo responsiveness. We found that only 10 out of 18 participants actually showed a differential increase of pain tolerance temperature (>0.5&#176;C) in the placebo compared to the control condition.\nPerformance during the go/nogo task and other measures\nThe distribution of, and mean RTs for errors, correct fast hits, and correct slow hits did not significantly differ between placebo and control conditions (see Table 1), indicating a very similar performance across conditions. We did not observe a significant difference in levels of state anxiety between the two sessions, as measured with the STAI (placebo 40.8 versus control 42.1, t(17)&#8202;=&#8202;1.3, p&#8202;=&#8202;0.22).\nError-Related ERPs\nGrand average event-related waveforms are depicted in Figure 3A. A repeated measures ANOVA including the within-subject factors RESPONSE (errors versus correct hits) and CONDITION (placebo versus control), carried out on the ERN amplitudes averaged across the three frontocentral electrodes (Fz, FCz, and Cz), revealed a highly significant main effect of RESPONSE (F(1,17)&#8202;=&#8202;25.0, p<0.001), showing, as expected, a larger ERN for errors relative to fast hits. However, the interaction term was not significant F(1,17)&#8202;=&#8202;1.6, p&#8202;=&#8202;0.23), suggesting that this early error-related activity was not significantly influenced by PA. Further, the ERN did not significantly correlate with changes in pain tolerance (r&#8202;=&#8202;0.11, p&#8202;=&#8202;0.66), and was not different between placebo responders versus non-responders (GROUP&#215;RESPONSE&#215;CONDITION interaction, F(1,16)&#8202;=&#8202;1.9, p&#8202;=&#8202;0.18).A different statistical outcome was found for the Pe component. As expected, the mean Pe amplitude was also significantly larger for errors than correct hits (F(1,17)&#8202;=&#8202;44.9, p<0.001), but critically, this error-specific component was also modulated by PA, as evidenced by a significant RESPONSE&#215;CONDITION interaction (F(1,17)&#8202;=&#8202;7.0, p&#8202;=&#8202;0.017). Planned comparisons using Bonferroni corrected t-tests showed that Pe amplitudes were larger for errors under placebo compared to control condition (p&#8202;=&#8202;0.004), whereas no difference was seen for amplitudes in response to fast hits (p&#8202;=&#8202;1.0), confirming that PA influenced error monitoring selectively.To further investigate whether this enhanced Pe amplitude was related to inter-individual differences in the placebo response, we compared Pe amplitudes between the two sessions, separately for the placebo-responders versus non-responders (see Figure 3B). The interaction effect between CONDITION and GROUP was significant (F(1,16)&#8202;=&#8202;4.7, p&#8202;=&#8202;0.045), demonstrating that the Pe amplitude significantly increased for the placebo condition in the responders (Bonferroni-corrected t-test, p&#8202;=&#8202;0.014), but not in the non-responders (p&#8202;=&#8202;1.0). Further, individual differences in placebo response (tolerance increase) correlated positively with the Pe-amplitude effect (Spearman&#8217;s Rho&#8202;=&#8202;0.46, p&#8202;=&#8202;0.055).\nSource Reconstructions\nIn order to gain insight into the brain generators underlying the modulation of the Pe component with PA, we used sLORETA to investigate which brain regions showed a significant interaction effect between RESPONSE&#215;CONDITION around the Pe component (100&#8211;280 ms). This statistical source analysis revealed three clusters with higher error-specific activity during the placebo condition, localized in the MPFC (MNI peak coordinates x&#8202;=&#8202;20, y&#8202;=&#8202;35, z&#8202;=&#8202;30), left LPFC (x&#8202;=&#8202;&#8722;15, y&#8202;=&#8202;50, z&#8202;=&#8202;45), and right LPFC (x&#8202;=&#8202;45, y&#8202;=&#8202;30, z&#8202;=&#8202;25, see Table 2 for detailed results). In each of these three regions, we found significantly higher activation for the placebo than the control condition, specifically for error trials (see Figure 4).\nDiscussion\nPlacebo effects are a compelling example of how perception may be profoundly shaped by expectations and social instructions, and more specifically how the generation and maintenance of beliefs in a pain-relieving treatment may regulate painful experiences. Despite a growing number of studies looking at the neural and pharmacological mechanisms, as well as psychological processes underlying this fascinating effect, little is known about the potential functional contribution of prefrontal cognitive control areas during PA. Previous studies have demonstrated that prefrontal areas (especially DLPFC and MPFC) are crucial for the installation of the analgesic response [3], [12], [13], but so far their functional role in PA remains unclear (cf. [9]). In order to test the assumption that PA could involve a recruitment of mechanisms similar to those employed in error monitoring, we compared error-related ERPs during PA versus a properly matched control condition, using a cross-over within-subject design.Our results demonstrate for the first time that PA is related to altered error monitoring brain processes at the level of the Pe component. Importantly, additional analyses confirmed that this PA-dependent effect upon the Pe was primarily driven by those participants who actually showed a placebo effect (increased pain tolerance), providing additional evidence that the Pe increase was linked to the analgesic effect of our manipulation. Remarkably, source reconstructions obtained using sLORETA confirmed that this effect was likely caused by increased activation of specific medial frontal as well as lateral prefrontal regions, which have classically been associated with adaptive control brain mechanisms [14], [17] and more recently with adjustments to social norms and expectations [46], [47], [48], [49], but have also been demonstrated to be crucial for PA [3], [6], [12], [13].Further, the ERP results suggest that the effects of PA are error-specific. Whereas the processing of correct actions (i.e. fast hits) was not influenced, neurophysiological responses to response errors were modulated by PA. Moreover, only the Pe component, and not the preceding ERN component, was reliably enhanced during PA. An additional analysis, in which we directly compared the GFP peaks of these two components (cf. [50]) did not yield a significant interaction effect between component (i.e. ERN versus Pe) and experimental condition. Hence, we cannot exclude the possibility that PA might also influence conflict or error processing at the level of the ERN. Whereas the ERN probably indexes an initial automatic stage of prediction error or motor mismatch detection in dMFC [14], [19], [35], [51], the Pe has been related to later stages of error processing, leading to error awareness and subsequent adaptive changes in behavior [28], [32], [35]. Consistent with this framework, it has been argued that the Pe component reflects context updating, thus swiftly signaling error salience and the need for adjustments in cognitive control [27], [28], [36]. Accordingly, our novel results of a Pe- effect suggest that PA may induce a transient change in the reactivity of cognitive control networks. These networks are probably necessary in order to adjust to a mismatch between predicted and experienced pain (see Fig. 1) [52], to modulate nociception by top-down reappraisal, and to influence opioidergic antinociceptive pathways [6], [11], [12], [53]. This transient increase in top-down cognitive control mechanisms could be general enough to modulate the processing of other events requiring enhanced cognitive control and top-down regulatory adjustments, such as response errors. Our findings also indirectly suggest that PA may depend on an altered balance between top-down expectations and bottom-up nociceptive processing. In line with this reasoning, a recent study [54] demonstrated that individual differences in a cognitive style of biases towards prior expectations were related to differences in placebo responsiveness. Furthermore, we also note the tight overlap between the source reconstructions underlying the Pe effect in LPFC and previous fMRI activations found in the exact same regions that actually predicted inter-individual differences in placebo responsiveness [6], [13].These changes in cognitive control processes during PA may be relatively specific to adjustments following mismatch detection, or alternatively, to events requiring emotion regulation [13]: A recent study combined placebo expectation with a working memory task in order to test directly whether PA interferes with executive attention resources [9]. Results showed additive, not interacting, effects of working memory load and placebo expectation on analgesia, suggesting that executive functions recruited during working memory are probably not directly involved in maintaining PA [9]. Consistent with this study, we did not find any differences in behavioral performance during placebo compared to the control condition. On the other hand, the use of an adaptive response deadline might have prevented strong differences in behavioral indices of performance monitoring across the two conditions. However, this procedure was an important prerequisite in order to obtain a balanced number of errors (and hence ERP averages) between sessions. More generally, it is also conceivable that the PA-dependent Pe increase seen here indicates differences in affective error appraisal [35], [36], rather than adjustments in attention or effort. This interpretation would be in line with the notion that PA is mediated by brain regions involved in the regulation of emotion [13].Our results, showing a modulation of error monitoring by expectation of pain relief, add to accumulating evidence of the importance of prefrontal control mechanisms for placebo effects. To the best of our knowledge, the present ERP results give a first hint on their functional role: PA may in part depend on domain-general cognitive control mechanisms that subsume error processing, mismatch detection, and subsequent adjustments in cognitive and emotional control (see Fig. 1). Future studies are needed to investigate whether the modulation of adaptive control functions induced by PA could also be observed in emotion regulation or conflict-resolution tasks other than error monitoring, and to characterize the role of individual and social expectations in PA.Further, more research is needed to establish whether the observed link between error monitoring and placebo analgesia can also be shown in a more general population or alternatively in clinical settings, where pain experience or relief expectations may be altered. Given the relatively low spatial resolution of electrophysiological source estimation and the use of conventional (uncorrected) statistical thresholds in our sLORETA analysis, we also suggest that future studies should employ fMRI (ideally in combination with scalp EEG measurements) in order to investigate the neuroanatomical substrates of PA-mediated effects on error monitoring processes in more detail.These findings also underscore the malleability of early error and performance monitoring brain processes. They show that these mechanisms are not only influenced by trait-like emotional or motivational factors [39], [55], but also by contextual or state-dependent changes in expectancies or beliefs. Psychosocial contextual factors such as expectation of pain relief may impose powerful modulations upon prefrontal cognitive control networks. As such, our results suggest that beyond environmental, genetic, or neuroanatomical differences, cognitive control and error monitoring brain processes are also readily shaped by intra-individual variations concerning abstract beliefs or social expectations.", "pmid": "23185436", "title": "Placebo Analgesia Affects Brain Correlates of Error Processing", "journal_title": "PLoS ONE", "authors": "Leonie Koban;Marcel Brass;Margaret T.

Table 1 compares previous versus new thresholds for high blood pressures.2\nOver the long&#160;term, hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular events, such as heart disease, stroke and kidney failure, and disability and premature mortality.3 Factors that increase the risk of high blood pressure include genetic and lifestyle factors such as excessive salt and fat consumption, physical inactivity, harmful alcohol consumption and poor management of stress.3 There is growing evidence that younger people (such as adolescents) are also at risk of hypertension because of these lifestyle factors.4 5\nHypertension is a major public health problem; it is the most common cardiovascular disorder affecting approximately one billion people globally, and remains (since the early 2000s) the single leading contributor to the global burden of morbidity and mortality.1 In Sub-Saharan Africa, it is estimated that 10&#8211;20&#8201;million people out of approximately 650&#8201;million people may have hypertension.6 This high prevalence of hypertension is attributed to population growth (migration from rural to urban areas), changes in dietary habits, ageing of the population and social stress.1 3 A large proportion of the population with hypertension remains undiagnosed, untreated or inadequately treated, contributing to the rising burden of cardiovascular disease.7\n\nDescription of the intervention\nScreening programmes for hypertension could help reduce morbidity and mortality linked to it.3 8 Screening is generally defined as the detection of unknown disease among apparently healthy individuals by means of tests or examinations conducted to identify those at an increased risk for the condition.9\nVarious devices (electronic, mercury and aneroid) can be used to measure blood pressure, with semiautomatic devices being the most reliable, because readings can be taken even when batteries run low, which may be a common problem in resource-limited settings.3 Two blood pressure measurements should be recorded daily for several days. These measurements should be taken at least a minute apart, ideally in the morning and again in the evening while the person is seated. For accuracy, measurements taken on the first day are discarded, and an average is taken of all the remaining measurements to confirm diagnosis of hypertension.3 It is common practice that the&#160;diagnosis of hypertension is confirmed if the resting blood pressure is persistently at SBP&#8805;130/140 or DBP&#8805;80/90 mm&#160;Hg.3 10 This review will primarily focus on screening strategies for hypertension and not be on the thresholds used for diagnosis; however, we will note blood pressure thresholds as defined by the authors of included studies.Key components of screening programmes for hypertension include equipment and trained health professionals&#160;and patient education and informed consent, and good relationships between health professions (which are beneficial for referral processes between different healthcare facilities or services).3 These components make screening for hypertension (across an entire population) a costly intervention, because of the lengthy time to diagnosis and the human and financial resources required.\nHow the intervention might work\nThe logic model11 in figure 1 outlines how hypertension screening may reduce the burden of disease considering participant, intervention, implementation and contextual factors. Early detection of hypertension through screening could increase awareness for those at risk of hypertension, and thus lead to preventative action or early management, which may ultimately curb the societal and economic burden of the disease.7\n\nWhy is it important to do this review?\nInterventions to prevent or manage hypertension should be feasible, affordable, sustainable and effective. Thus, vertical programmes that focus solely on hypertension are not consistently recommended.3 Early detection of hypertension may be a critical element for containing health-related costs, especially when screening for hypertension is offered as a point-of-care or integrated service. However, hypertension is primarily associated with behavioural and socioeconomic risk factors; therefore, early detection of mild hypertension may not significantly impact health-related costs in the long&#160;term or improve health outcomes. Additionally, the factors associated with hypertension are generally the problems of urban areas in resource-limited countries; therefore, preventing hypertension may involve other stakeholders (eg, policy-makers) beyond screening by health professionals.3 12\nSince it is unclear whether screening for hypertension leads to healthier behaviours and better control of blood pressure levels, it is important to learn from studies that have assessed the impact of screening on hypertension outcomes. A 2014 systematic review supported the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force in updating its recommendation on screening for high blood pressure in adults. This review focused on the role of confirming hypertension diagnoses, rescreening intervals and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and home blood pressure monitoring. The evidence from this systematic review does not provide guidance on different screening strategies.A recent overview of systematic reviews, on diabetes and hypertension screening programmes, found that there is a need for a systematic review to assess the effectiveness and impact of various screening interventions.13 This review aims to address this gap in the literature, with a specific focus on evidence from resource-limited countries, where the behavioural and socioeconomic risk factors of hypertension are similar to the broader problems of urban areas in these countries. This will provide clarity on whether screening of hypertension, in all age groups, will contain health-related costs and improve outcomes related to hypertension and associated life-threatening complications.\nObjectives\nTo assess the comparative effectiveness of different screening strategies, mass, targeted or opportunistic, for hypertension to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with hypertension.\nMethods\n\nCriteria for considering studies for this review\n\nTypes of studies\nWe will include randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomised controlled trials (NRCTs),14 that is, controlled before and after (CBA), interrupted time series (ITS) and prospective analytic cohort studies. We do not expect to find many RCTs, so NRCTs will also be included in the review, given the programmatic nature of screening for hypertension. RCTs are experimental studies in which people are randomly allocated to one of two or more groups receiving an intervention or control treatment or no treatment. CBA is a type of non-randomised study in which outcomes are measured before and after a treatment, both in a group that receives the treatment and in another comparison group. ITS is also a type of non-randomised study that measures an outcome at multiple time points before and after an intervention (the &#8216;interruption&#8217;). The design attempts to detect whether the intervention has had an effect greater than any underlying trend over time. ITS studies should be controlled and they must have at least three data points before and after a clearly defined intervention in terms of content and timing.15 The last type of non-randomised study that we will include is prospective analytic cohort studies, where participants are already either exposed or unexposed to an intervention, but without the outcome of interest at the start of the study, because participants are followed forward in time after which outcomes are measured. There should be at least two arms for the cohort to provide a comparison of the exposure of interest.We will include studies regardless of their language or publication status.\nTypes of participants and setting\nParticipants are healthy adolescents, adults and elderly persons (aged between 15 and 65+) without known hypertension. We will include studies where participants present with risk factors for hypertension.\nTypes of interventions and comparator\nStudies on mass, targeted or opportunistic hypertension screening will be eligible. The interventions must be compared with no screening and participants must be followed for at least 1&#8201;year.Mass screening involves screening apparently healthy populations regardless of risk factors (at public places, for example, markets); targeted screening involves screening specific groups of people who are considered to be at higher risk of hypertension than the general population; and opportunistic screening involves screening individuals engaging with the health system or another environment where screening may be offered (eg, HIV clinic, corporate health day).\nTypes of outcome measures\nClinicalOverall mortality (total deaths).Hypertension-related mortality (deaths related to heart failure, coronary heart disease, stroke or end-stage kidney disease).Hypertension-related morbidity (incidence, prevalence and hospitalisation due to stroke, coronary heart disease or end-stage renal disease).Incidence and prevalence of hypertension (ratio of detected hypertension to expected prevalence of hypertension).Quality of life (physical and psychological well-being and perceptions of the effects of treatment).\nHealth systemHealthcare utilisation (time spent in care, duration on medication).Linkage to care (attending clinic to initiate treatment following screening).Retention in care after diagnosis and initiation of treatment.Costs and cost&#160;effectiveness.\nAdverse events of being screenedPsychological consequences of being screened, for example, false positive or false negative and being correctly classified as positive (new diagnosis)\n\nSearch methods for identification of studies\n\nElectronic searches\nThe Cochrane Hypertension information specialist will search the following databases without language, publication year or publication status restrictions:The Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register via the Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS-Web).The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials via the CRS-Web.Medline Ovid (from 1946 onwards), Medline Ovid Epub Ahead of Print, and Medline Ovid In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations.Embase Ovid (from 1974 onwards).LILACS Bireme (from 1982 onwards).ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov).WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (www.who.it.trialsearch).\nThe subject strategies for databases will be modelled on the search strategy designed for Medline in online appendix 1. Where appropriate, these will be combined with subject strategy adaptations of the sensitivity-maximising and precision-maximising search strategy designed by Cochrane for identifying RCTs (as described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions V.5.1.0, Box 6.4.c. (Handbook 2011)). Search terms for non-randomised trials are based on the Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) search filter for Ovid Medline. Full strategies for the above databases will be published in the review.\nSearching other resources\n\nData collection and analysis\n\nSelection of studies\nAt least, two review authors will independently screen all titles or abstracts, or both, of all records retrieved to determine their eligibility for full-text screening. Full&#160;texts of potentially eligible or unclear studies will be retrieved and assessed for inclusion into the review by two researchers independently. Any disagreements will be resolved through rechecking the full&#160;text and/or discussion with a third reviewer. We will present a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses flow diagram and a table of excluded studies and explanations for exclusion, in the review.16\n\nData extraction and management\nWe will pilot the data extraction form on two included studies to ensure information is captured in a standard manner. Two review authors will independently extract study data related to participants, intervention, comparison and outcome characteristics using the standard data extraction form. We will record any missing information in order to contact the author of the primary study. Any disagreements will be resolved through discussion or in consultation with a third reviewer.\nAssessment of risk of bias in included studies\nThe risk of bias assessment tool modified by the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Group will be used.13 It is widely used and validated for systematic reviews including a wide range of study designs. Review authors will independently assess the risk of bias in included studies. Any disagreements will be resolved through discussion or in consultation with a third reviewer. We will judge individual studies to have &#8216;low&#8217;, &#8216;unclear&#8217; or &#8216;high&#8217; risk of bias. Low risk of bias is plausible bias unlikely to alter results, unclear risk of bias is plausible bias that raises some doubt about the results and high risk of bias is plausible bias that seriously weakens confidence in results. We will follow the recommendation by EPOC to score NRCTs as &#8216;high&#8217; risk of bias.17\nThe following criteria will be applied to assess the risk of bias assessment in RCTs and NRCTs:Was the allocation sequence adequately generated? (RCTs)Was the allocation adequately concealed? (RCTs)Were baseline outcome measurements similar? (All)Were baseline characteristics similar? (All)Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed? (RCTs)Was the knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study? (RCTs)Was the study adequately protected against contamination? (RCTs)Was the study free from selective outcome reporting? (RCTs)Was the study free from other risks of bias? (All)\nFor ITS, the risk of bias assessment will be based on the following criteria:Was the intervention independent of other changes?Was the shape of the intervention effect pre-specified?Was the intervention unlikely to affect data collection?Was knowledge of the allocated interventions adequately prevented during the study?Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed?Was the study free from selective outcome reporting?Was the study free from other risks of bias?\n\nMeasures of treatment effect\nWe will present dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios, and continuous outcomes as mean differences (MD) with SD between the change in the intervention and control groups if the outcomes have been measured in the same way across all studies. In the case that continuous outcomes have been measured in different ways across studies, then we will use the standardised MD between the intervention and control groups. We will present time-to-event outcomes as HR. We will report 95% CIs for all outcomes.\nUnit of analysis issues\nWe will consider the level at which randomisation occurred (eg, in cluster-randomised trials, groups of individuals may be randomised together to the same intervention), and where repeated measurements are taken, there may be multiple observations for the same outcome.18 In the case that more than one comparison is available from the same study, we will combine groups into a single pair comparison. If included cluster-randomised trials have not appropriately adjusted for the clustering of participants in their analysis, then we will attempt to reanalyse them. The design effect (of cluster-randomised trials) may lead to inflated effect sizes of the intervention, so we will do a calculation of the design effect which involves an estimation of an intracluster correlation (ICC). Estimates of ICC will be imputed using estimates from other included studies that reported ICCs or using external estimates from empirical research. Additionally, we will examine the impact of the clustering using sensitivity analyses.\nDealing with missing data\nWhere necessary, we will contact the authors of included studies for which data related to study methods, attrition rates and outcomes are unclear or missing. We will, for example, request number of participants screened, randomly assigned participants, intention to treat, as&#160;treated or per protocol samples, dropouts, losses to follow-up or withdrawals. If estimates for the entire study sample are not provided (eg, only estimates for each sex groups are provided), then we will calculate it using available information, including imputing data, where appropriate. We will report all missing outcome data in the data extraction form and risk of bias table, as well as assess the impact of including studies with missing data in sensitivity analysis.\nAssessment of heterogeneity\nWe will assess heterogeneity and variability among studies in relation to participant, intervention, comparison and outcome information, as well as context and type of screening and its implementation. Where meta-analysis is undertaken, heterogeneity will be assessed by visual inspection of overlap of CIs and statistical methods, that&#160;is, &#967;2 and I2. If the &#967;2 test has a small p&#160;value (p<0.1) and the I2 statistic is 60% and above, then this indicates moderate or substantial heterogeneity.18 We plan to explore reasons for heterogeneity through subgroup analyses.\nAssessing reporting bias\nWe will assess the likelihood of reporting bias for each outcome where a sufficient number of studies (more than 10) are included in a meta-analysis. We will use a funnel plot to visually check for asymmetry associated with small-study effects and publication bias. Through sensitivity analysis, we will assess how these factors affect the results and conclusions of the meta-analysis.\nData synthesis\nWe will conduct a meta-analysis if the included studies are sufficiently homogenous and if at least two studies of the same design assess the same intervention, comparison and outcome. Outcomes should be at clinically relevant time points after hypertension screening to be analysed; for example, death within 3&#8201;months of screening may not be clinically relevant. If the characteristics of included studies are excessively heterogeneous, we will not pool results, but we will present a narrative synthesis of the results, potentially grouping findings by context measures.We will assess the certainty of the overall evidence for each outcome according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.19 GRADE is for rating the certainty of evidence and grading the strength of recommendations in systematic reviews and it includes five criteria for downgrading the certainty of evidence: risk of bias, inconsistency, imprecision, publication bias and indirectness; and three criteria for upgrading the certainty of evidence: large effect, dose response and residual confounding opposing the observed effect. The certainty of evidence will be reported as high, moderate, low or very low. High certainty means that further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect; moderate certainty means that further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate; low certainty means that further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate; and very low certainty means that we are very uncertain about the estimate. The assessment will be reported in GRADE summary of findings tables. The summary of findings table will include the number of participants and studies included for each outcome, a summary of intervention effect and a measure of the certainty of evidence against GRADE criteria. We will present results for the outcomes listed as 1&#8211;7 in the Types of outcome measures section. The seven main outcomes are presented, prioritising clinically important outcomes, followed by adverse effect and health system outcomes. Given the complex nature of the interventions being studied, prespecification of the outcomes is challenging.14\n\nSubgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity\nSubgroup analyses will be considered according to the following:Sex: female or male.Age: adolescents (15&#8211;24), adults (25&#8211;64) and elderly persons (65+).Ethnicity: White, Black, Asian or other.Setting: rural versus urban; or low-income and middle-income countries versus high-income countries (which will be defined according the World Bank&#8217;s country classifications by income level).20\nScreening tools: electronic, mercury or aneroid.Cardiovascular risk factors: overweight or obesity, physical inactivity, dietary factors (eg, sodium or salt intake) and comorbid conditions.Study duration:&#160;6 months or similar.\n\nSensitivity analysis\nWe will conduct sensitivity analysis to explore the influence of various factors, when applicable, on the effect size. We will stratify analyses per publication status and level of risk of bias to determine whether studies with high risk of bias skew the results.\nPatient and public involvement\nThere was no patient or public involvement in designing the study or writing up the study protocol, but the systematic review is a response to priority setting conducted in collaboration with policy-makers.\nSupplementary Material\n", "pmid": "30647046", "title": "Screening strategies for hypertension: a systematic review protocol", "journal_title": "BMJ Open", "authors": "Bey-Marri\u00e9 Schmidt;Solange Dur\u00e3o;Ingrid Toews;Charlotte M Bavuma;Joerg J Meerpohl;Tamara Kredo", "doi": "10.1136/bmjopen-2018-025043", "score": "0.0047345064"}, {"keywords": "Autoimmune pancreatitis;Immunoglobulin G4;Sclerosant colangitis", "abstract": "Autoimmune pancreatitis is a fibro-inflammatory form of chronic pancreatitis.

It divided into two categories.1 Type I involves both genders but is more prevalent among males and associated with hyperimmunoglobulin G4, anti-nuclear antibody, anti-smooth muscle antibody, anti-lactoferrin antibody, and anti-carbonic anhydrase antibody.2,3 Extra-pancreatic manifestations and association with other autoimmune diseases is also common in type I autoimmune pacreatitis. Type II is not associated with either specific autoantibodies or extra-pancreatic manifestations. Increased IgG4 to levels above 135 mg/dl in type I differentiates autoimmune pancreatitis from other pancreatic disorders although high IgG4 levels have been reported in pancreatic carcinoma and chronic pancreatitis.3 However in detecting autoimmune pancreatitis, pancreatic enlargement and narrowing of the pancreatic duct should be considered.\n\nHistopathological evaluations show lymphocytic and plasmacytic infiltration around the pancreatic ducts accompanied with lymphoid follicles and an increase in the thickness of the intralobular septate and fibrosis as well as obliterans phlebitis. Although this condition can result in various extra-pancreatic lesions similar to primary sclerosant cholangitis it can be\ndifferentiated by detection of IgG4+ plasma cell infiltration around the pancreatic ducts and appropriate response to corticosteroid therapy. The overall prognosis is not well-defined. An endoscopy may reveal focal infiltration of plasma cells in the stomach, duodenum, and colon.4 Autoimmune pancreatitis may be accompanied by other autoimmune diseases such as ulcerative colitis or autoimmune hepatitis. CT scan images may show various conditions including local or diffused enlargement of the pancreas, a pancreatic mass or a normal pancreas.5 Local mild lymphadenopathy is also a common finding. Focal involvement mostly occurs in the head of the pancreas. Autoimmune pancreatitis should be differentiated from pancreatic carcinoma by the absence of diffuse pancreatic duct stenosis in cases of pancreatic carcinoma.6,7 Cholangiopancreatography demonstrates the presence of local or diffused pancreatic duct stenosis that may be associated with biliary duct stenosis.8\n\nThe diagnostic criteria for autoimmune pancreatitis are a combination of radiologic, laboratory, and histopathologic findings.\n\nShort course corticosteroid treatment should be considered for patients who refer with typical autoimmune pancreatitis presentations even if serological and histopathological findings are absent. The presence of radiological and laboratory findings in accordance with autoimmune pancreatitis is sufficient to administer corticosteroid therapy. Due to extra-pancreatic manifestations and association with other autoimmune diseases, autoimmune pancreatitis is sometimes introduced as a systemic disease. This case report introduces a patient with autoimmune pancreatitis who manifested with extra-pancreatic presentations similar to primary sclerosant cholangitis. It is important to consider autoimmune pancreatitis as a possible diagnosis for patients with jaundice and abdominal pain who do not have diagnostic results of routine laboratory tests and are unresponsive to conventional treatments.\n\n\nCASE REPORT\n\n\nA 41-year-old female referred with a history of increasing abdominal pain and jaundice since 2 weeks prior. The patient did not have any history of alcohol consumption, drug abuse, previous liver and biliary or hematologic diseases, transfusion, high risk sexual behavior, and recent travel to high risk regions for infectious diseases. The patient had diffuse abdominal pain that increased with eating and the sclera was icteric. There was no evidence of fever, diarrhea, constipation, ascites, hematemesis, hematochezia, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, or weight loss. Routine laboratory analysis revealed increased liver function test results, especially alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total and direct bilirubin, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR).\nPancreatic enzymes were normal( Table 1).\n\nAbdominal ultrasound evaluations reported a normal-size liver with increased tissue echo and mild dilatation of the intra- and extra-hepatobiliary ducts. Common biliary duct, portal system, and liver veins were normal. MRI imaging of the abdomen showed mild dilatation of the intra- and extra-hepatobiliary\nducts(Figure 1). By taking into consideration the observed biliary duct dialatation and absence of any intra-hepatic conditions, we requested laboratory markers for viral hepatitis, hemachromatosis, Wilson&#8217;s disease, celiac, and primary biliary cirrhosis - all had negative results. Peripheral blood smear showed no evidence of hemolysis. Due to the high ALP, irregular dilatations and stenosis of the intra- and extra-hepatobiliary ducts and pancreatic duct results from MRCP, the presence of ANA and IgG4 were evaluated, both of which were both\npositive(Figure 2). Thus according to the association of clinical presentations that included abdominal pain and obstructive jaundice with the presence of specific autoimmune markers the patient underwent corticosteroid therapy, 30mg daily, with a diagnosis of autoimmune pancreatitis accompanied by autoimmune sclerosant cholangitis. At the one month follow up visit post-treatment, the control laboratory tests and MRCP revealed normal liver function results along with normal IgG4 and ANA, and normal intra- and extra-hepatobiliary ducts.\n\n\nDISCUSSION\n\n\nAutoimmune pancreatitis can be diagnosed according to the following criteria: 1) narrowing of the pancreatic duct with segmental or diffused irregularity and localized or diffused pancreatic enlargement observed in imaging modalities; 2) increase in serum IgG4 levels and the presence of autoantibodies such as antinuclear antibody and rheumatoid factor (RF); and 3) intralobular fibrosis, plasma cell and lymphocytic infiltration around the pancreatic ducts and local\nlymph node enlargement.9,10 Autoimmune pancreatitis is defined as the presence of criterion 1 with either criterion 2 or 3.\n\nHowever, the most recent criteria for diagnosis of autoimmune pancreatitis has changed as follows:3\n\nA definite diagnosis is defined by either criteria A+C, A+B, A+B+C, or A+B+C+D, whereas a probable diagnosis is the presence of criteria A+D and suspicion of disease is only criteria A.\n\nRecent Mayo Clinic studies have introduced additional criteria for the histopathological diagnosis of autoimmune pancreatitis; predictive images in CT scan or pancreatography and increased IgG4 level, and response to corticosteroid therapy.11 They have reported diffused enlargement of the pancreas in 27% of patients diagnosed with autoimmune pancreatitis. Increased IgG4 was present in 71% of patients with mean values of 134 mg/dl.\n\nAutoimmune pancreatitis is more prevalent among males and commonly presents with mild abdominal pain without typical pancreatitis pain that sometimes is accompanied by obstructive jaundice.1 Increased pancreatic and hepatobiliary enzymes may also be present.12 Therefore the endocrine and exocrine functions of the pancreas may be impaired.\n\nHistopathological evaluations show intralobular fibrosis, lymphocytic and IgG4+ plasma cell infiltration, and obliterans phlebitis observed in biopsies and autopsies. None of these findings are present in chronic pancreatitis in alcoholics and those with Sj&#246;gren&#8217;s syndrome.13-16 Specific inflammatory changes in patients with autoimmune pancreatitis strongly suggest a close relation to mutational fibrosclerosis.\n\nExtrapancreatic manifestations of these patients include sclerosant cholangitis,17\nretroperitoneal fibrosis,18 interstitial nephritis,19 chronic thyroiditis, interstitial pneumonia, in addition to mediastinal and peritoneal lymphadenopathy.\n\nAutoimmune pancreatitis associated sclerosant cholangitis can be differentiated from primary sclerosant cholangitis by the presence of IgG4+ plasma cell infiltration around the pancreatic duct and a response to corticosteroid therapy.\n\nThe current patient&#8217;s pancreas imaging evaluations were normal however her IgG4 level increased to 276 mg/dl. The presence of ANA in conjunction with the above results and appropriate response to corticosteroid therapy fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for autoimmune pancreatitis.20\n\nRoutine laboratory evaluations in this patient revealed a significant increase in ALP and direct bilirubin; the patient also had obstructive jaundice.\n\nSonography and MRI showed dilatation of ducts secondary to stenosis and obstruction confirmed by MRCP as secondary dilatation and stenosis in the pancreas and biliary ducts which was similar to sclerosant cholangitis.21,22 A control MRCP at one month after corticosteroid therapy showed no evidence of dilatations and stenosis.\n\nThis report introduced a case of autoimmune pancreatitis with pancreatic duct stenosis, increased IgG4, positive antinuclear antibody, and appropriate response to corticosteroid therapy as well as its association with sclerosant cholangitis, which resolved after therapy. We discussed the diagnostic criteria in this rare condition.23-26\n\n\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST\n\n\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest related to this work.\n", "pmid": "24829705", "title": "Autoimmune Pancreatitis: A Case Report", "journal_title": "Middle East Journal of Digestive Diseases", "authors": "Masoumeh Salari;Mousareza Hosseini;Sirous Nekooei;Sajad Ataei Azimi;Mohammad Reza Farzanehfar", "score": "0.004580601"}, {"keywords": "Abdominal obesity;Sasang constitutional medicine;Prevalence;Waist circumference;Risk factor", "abstract": "Background\nAbdominal obesity (AO) is a medical condition in which excess body fat accumulates in the abdomen. It may cause adverse effects on health and result in reduced life expectancy or increased health problems. While various genetic approaches have explained the risks of AO in Western society, the Sasang constitution (SC) has been identified as a risk factor in Korean medicine. Different SC types are associated with different fat distribution, body shapes and susceptibility to diseases. We evaluated whether the SC type could be a risk for AO in a cross-sectional study among Koreans.Methods\nIn total, 2,528 subjects aged over 30&#160;years were recruited from 23 medical clinics. We collected waist circumference (WC), weight, height, and some clinical information for AO from the subjects.

Obesity, especially abdominal obesity (AO), is a substantial risk factor for hypertension, metabolic disease, cardiovascular disease, gallbladder disease, osteoarthritis, and sleep apnea [2].Furthermore, the waist circumference (WC) plays pivotal roles in those diseases because of its central fat distribution [3-7]. Therefore, the World Health Organization (WHO) has classified obese guide according to not only body mass index (BMI) but also WC [8] and the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III also has defined AO as one of important factors for metabolic syndrome [9]. Eventually, the WHO has identified that human beings should overcome AO in the 21st century and observed that the wait for a cure may take a long time [10]. The fundamental cause of AO is presumed to be a combination of environmental factors (inappropriate eating and physical inactivity) and the organism&#8217;s genes, such as the 5-HT2A gene and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) gene in Western society [11-15].Sasang constitutional medicine (SCM) is a tailored Korean traditional medicine that classifies human beings into four constitutions: Taeyangin (TY), Soyangin (SY), Tae-eumin, (TE), and Soeumin (SE) [16]. Each constitution is classified by characteristics of body shape, face, voice, and psychological and physiological aspects [17,18], and those characteristics are different from one constitution to another [19]. Therefore, each constitution has a different susceptibility to pathology and several chronic diseases. Hypertension and diabetes mellitus (DM) were revealed to be associated with a specific Sasang constitution (SC) [19-23].According to SCM theory, lung hypo-function and liver hyper-function are related to a large WC, and the TE type is associated with hyperactive liver function and a developed waist area [16,17]. We hypothesize that SC could be a risk for AO. Several family studies have been conducted to investigate the genetic evidence for SC, and they found that SC could be not only inherent but also a risk factor for obesity [24,25]. However, there has been no clinical study to show that SC could a risk factor for AO.In this study, we present indirect evidence of whether SC could be a risk factor for AO among Koreans.\nMethods\nThis was a cross-sectional study conducted from Nov. 2007 to Jul. 2011 in 23 Korean medical clinics (KMCs).\nStudy subjects and size\nThe study size was assumed from a Bernoulli distribution. We calculated a sample size of at least 600 subjects of each constitution on the basis of a 95% confidence interval and a 4% margin of error. The eligible subjects were recruited from KMCs among individuals over 30 years old whose constitution had been confirmed by experts in SC. Individuals who could not understand and follow the researcher&#8217;s indication or keep their measurement posture because of severe physical/mental illness were excluded. The detailed researcher&#8217;s indication and the subjects&#8217; measurement posture were described in Jang&#8217;s study [26]. The subjects with body deformation such as lump or congenital malformation in the measurement location, or pregnant women were also excluded. A total of 2,598 subjects (931 males and 1,667 females) were recruited from 23 KMCs. Three of them were excluded because of missing data. A total of 67 TY types were also excluded because of their low proportion in the Korean population. In total, 2,528 subjects (909 males and 1,619 females) were included in the final analysis. A flowchart of the study design is shown in Figure&#160;1.This study was approved by the Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine (KIOM) Institutional Review Board (I-0910/02-001). Written informed consent for participation in this study was obtained from each of the subjects.\nSasang constitutional diagnosis\nAn SCM expert at each hospital diagnosed individual SC types. For accurate diagnoses, we strictly adhered to defined qualifications of the experts and subject criteria. The SCM experts had more than 5&#160;years of experience in clinical practice. The administration of constitution-specific pharmaceuticals was used as an additional method to confirm the subject SC. A more detailed procedure of diagnosing SC was described in Song&#8217;s study [27].\nData collection\nWe collected WC measurements to determine the AO prevalence according to SC. We also collected data on age, sex, body mass index (BMI), and blood pressure and blood samples to control for the influence of confounding factors, which are important risk factors for AO [28,29]. WC was measured around the level of the umbilical scar of the subjects, who took their upper clothing off and stood in an erect posture with their arms folded in front of their chest [26]. BMI was indirectly calculated through the weight and height, and the blood pressure was measured from each subject&#8217;s left upper arm after enough rest. To reduce measurement bias among the KMCs, all instructors were educated by KIOM at least once per year, and KIOM monitored the progress of the data collection. All instructors followed a standard operation procedure (SOP) that was developed for the &#8220;Korea Constitution Multicenter Study&#8221; [26,30].Blood samples were collected after more than 12&#160;hours of fasting, and the fasting blood glucose, triglyceride (TG) and HDL cholesterol levels were tested by an authorized institution.\nDiagnostic criteria\nHypertension was diagnosed by following the guidelines of the 7th Report of the JNC as&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;90&#160;mmHg for diastolic pressure, &#8805;140&#160;mmHg for systolic pressure or taking medicine for the treatment of high blood pressure [31]. DM was diagnosed with the ADA criteria as &#8805;126&#160;mg/dl of fasting plasma glucose or taking medicine for the treatment of DM [32]. Hypertriglyceridemia was diagnosed as TG &#8805;150&#160;mg/dl, and low HDL cholesterol was diagnosed as HDL cholesterol <40&#160;mg/dl in males and <50&#160;mg/dl in females. To diagnose AO, we followed the WHO Report of Asia-Pacific guideline of WC&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;90&#160;cm for males and&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;80&#160;cm for females [33].\nStatistical analysis\nConsidering the influence of sexual differences, all analyses were separately conducted in males and females. A one-way ANOVA was used to compare continuous variables (Scheff&#233;&#8217;s post-hoc analysis). A Chi-square test was performed to compare the prevalence of AO according to SC. Multiple logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) for AO. To evaluate whether the SC could be a risk factor for AO, covariant variables, including age, BMI, hypertension, DM, hypertriglyceridemia, and low HDL cholesterol, were considered. We conducted all of the analyses using SPSS 17.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). The statistical levels of significance were considered to be p values <0.05.\nResults\n\nGeneral characteristics\nThe distribution of SC into TE, SE, and SY types was 44.8%, 21%, and 34.2% in males and 38.6%, 27.2%, and 34.2% in females, respectively. The subjects&#8217; general characteristics, including age, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, TG, HDL cholesterol, and WC, are shown in Table&#160;1 according to gender and constitution.\nThe rate of AO according to SC\nThe rate of AO was 42.8% in males and 62.1% in females. The prevalence of AO differed significantly according to constitution. The male AO rate according to constitution was 63.7% in the TE type, 14.7% in the SE type and 32.8% in the SY type, and the female AO rate according to constitution was 84.8% in the TE type, 41.7% in the SE type and 52.8% in the SY type. The details are shown in Table&#160;2.\nORs for AO before and after adjustment\nTable&#160;3 shows a sequentially developed multiple logistic regression model of AO. Model 1 was crude, without adjustment, model 2 was adjusted for age and BMI, and model 3 was adjusted for age, BMI, hypertension, DM, hypertriglyceridemia, and low HDL cholesterol. Because the TE type was assumed to be a more dangerous risk factor than other types, the results were described as SE type versus TE type and SY type versus TE type.The result revealed that the TE type was associated with increased AO prevalence compared with SE and SY types in males (model 1, OR 10.19; 95% CI 6.5&#8211;15.96, p&#8201;<&#8201;0.001 and OR 3.59; 95% CI 2.63&#8211;4.9, p&#8201;<&#8201;0.001, respectively). The TE type remained significantly associated with increased AO prevalence after adjusting for age and BMI (model 2, OR 1.77; 95% CI 1.01-3.16, p&#8201;=&#8201;0.045 and OR 1.72; 95% CI 1.17-2.53, p&#8201;=&#8201;0.006, respectively) and age, BMI, hypertension, DM, hypertriglyceridemia, and low HDL cholesterol (model 3, OR 1.79; 95% CI 1.02-3.15, p&#8201;=&#8201;0.044 and OR 1.74; 95% CI 1.18&#8211;2.58, p&#8201;=&#8201;0.006, respectively).We also found a similar trend in females. The TE type was associated with increased AO prevalence compared with SE and SY types (model 1, OR 7.79; 95% CI 5.84&#8211;10.4, p&#8201;<&#8201;0.001 and OR 4.99; 95% CI 3.79&#8211;6.56, p&#8201;<&#8201;0.001, respectively), and the TE type remained significantly associated with increased AO prevalence after adjusting for age and BMI (model 2, OR 1.65; 95% CI 1.13&#8211;2.41, p&#8201;=&#8201;0.01 and OR 1.9; 95% CI 1.35&#8211;2.7, p&#8201;<&#8201;0.001, respectively) and age, BMI, hypertension, DM, hypertriglyceridemia, and low HDL cholesterol (model 3, OR 1.51; 95% CI 1.03-2.23, p&#8201;=&#8201;0.037 and OR 1.88; 95% CI 1.32&#8211;2.68, p&#8201;<&#8201;0.001, respectively).\nDiscussion\nSeveral studies have suggested that the SC could be associated with some chronic diseases, and it has been recognized as an independent risk factor [19-23]. Recently, a gene-level study also revealed that SC was associated with AO [34]. In this cross-sectional study, we aimed to determine whether the SC could be a risk factor for AO among Koreans.This study suggested that SC may be a significant and independent risk factor of AO. Specifically, the TE type was associated with increased AO prevalence compared with the SE and SY types in males (OR 1.79; 95% CI 1.02&#8211;3.15, and OR 1.74; 95% CI 1.18&#8211;2.58, respectively) and females (OR 1.51; 95% CI 1.03&#8211;2.23, and OR 1.88; 95% CI 1.32-2.68, respectively), even after adjusting for age, BMI, hypertension, DM, hypertriglyceridemia, and low HDL cholesterol. This result means that the TE type could be more susceptible to AO than other types, which is similar to the trend found for hypertension, DM, and metabolic syndrome, which are associated with SC [19-23].The results revealed that the WC was different according to SC type, and the TE type had the largest WC, which was similar to other characteristics. The rates of AO were different among SC types, and the rate of AO in the TE type was higher than in other types in both genders. However, because the comparatively larger WC of the TE type may be caused by a relatively higher BMI, age, and several chronic diseases [35], it is necessary to explain the pure influence of SC itself. Accordingly, we calculated ORs for AO with a logistic regression analysis model after adjusting for the influence of potential variables. The multiple logistic regression analysis showed that large differences in the OR between the TE type and other types prior to adjusting for the potential variables (model 1) were still significant in models 2 and 3. Furthermore, this trend was similar in both males and females.This trend supports the hypothesis that people classified as TE type might have a bigger belly and a higher prevalence rate for AO compared with other types, even if each type has similar physical characteristics. This finding might also be indirect evidence for SCM, which suggests that body shape could develop differently from one constitution to another.In this study, we tried to enroll a representative Korean population from nationwide centers. We also minimized measurement error by following SOPs [30] and blood testing error by utilizing a qualified institution.The prevalence rates of AO in this study were relatively high compared with a previous study conducted by the Korean government [36]. For this reason, we assumed that the average age in this study was relatively higher.Our study has several limitations. Previously, a large Korean family study suggested a significant association of chromosomes 8q11.22-23 and 11q22.1-3 with SC [25], and another study found that SC was associated with AO at the genetic level [34]. Family surveys and gene-level studies could be a good method to demonstrate whether SC is an inherent risk factor for AO. However, because our study had a cross-sectional design, we could not analyze the association between inherent SC and AO. In addition, we did not control for environmental factors, such as meals, lifestyle, and exercise habits, which are acquired risk factors for AO.We believe that further studies on not only a direct comparison between constitutions considering acquired environmental factors for AO but also on inherent family SC are needed.\nConclusions\nThis study suggested that SC, especially the TE type, might be significantly and independently associated with AO. This finding reveals that SC should be considered a risk factor in predicting AO.\nAbbreviations\nTE: Tae-eumin; SE: Soeumin; SY: Soyangin; AO: Abdominal obesity; NO: Non-obese; WC: Waist circumference.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors\u2019 contributions\nEJ carried out the qualitative data analysis and drafted the manuscript.

Peer-reviewed publication is an essential vehicle to share newly acquired knowledge, and without publication of high quality research, advancements in the quality of care will be limited. Since there are scarce resources to support medical research, it is important to prioritize resources toward the highest impact diseases, however, due to the large number of different stakeholders involved in health care, research prioritization is a very complex process [4]. Several factors influence research priority setting, however, one important factor is the estimated burden of disease [5-7].Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) not only represents one of the most prevalent chronic diseases in developed countries [8] but also represents a substantial burden of disease on patient quality of life [9], productivity [10], and health care spending [11]. Based on the best available evidence, the prevalence of CRS in North America and Europe likely falls within the range of 5% and 12% [12-14] which rivals and potentially exceeds that of other common chronic diseases such as asthma and diabetes mellitus (DM) (Table&#160;1) [12,15-18]. If research prioritization accurately reflects burden of disease, then the volume and quality of publications should be somewhat similar between diseases with similar burden of disease.Table 1\nGeographic prevalence rates per chronic disease\n\nChronic disease\n\nPrevalence\n\nCanada\n\nUS\n\nEurope/UK\n\nMean\n\nCRS\n5.7% [13]12.1% [12]10.9% [14]9.6%\nAsthma\n7.9% [15]8% [12]3.8% [16]6.6%\nDM\n6.6% [17]8.6 [12]6.4% [18]7.2%US, United States; UK, United Kingdom; CRS, chronic rhinosinusitis; DM, diabetes mellitus.The primary objective of this review is to evaluate how the volume of research publications for CRS has changed over the last 45&#160;years and compare the volume of research to asthma and DM. The secondary objective is to evaluate the differences in high-quality publications between each of the chronic diseases. The purpose of this study is to identify potential disparities in research output for CRS, compared to similar chronic diseases, which may be used to improve future research priority setting.\nMethods\nThe three comparator groups in this review include: CRS, asthma, and DM (both type I and II). Asthma and DM were chosen as comparators due to their similar chronic disease state (often requiring life-long medical therapy) as well as their similar prevalence rates [12-18] and impact on quality of life [9,19,20]. A literature search was performed in December 2014 using Ovid MEDLINE (R) (1970 - December 2014) to define the volume of research publications for CRS, asthma, and DM. The following search terms were used to identify published literature for CRS (terms: &#8216;chronic&#8217; AND &#8216;*sinusitis&#8217;), asthma (term: &#8216;asthma&#8217;), and DM (terms: &#8216;diabetes&#8217; AND &#8216;mellitus&#8217;). An unlimited truncation strategy (placement of *) was used to capture all variations of key disease related terms.After the overall volumes of publications were obtained, limitations for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), systematic reviews (SRs), and meta-analyses (MAs) were applied to separate the overall volume of publications into sub groups. The National Institute for Health Research Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED) was searched using the same key terms to identify the volume of economic evaluations (EEs) published for each chronic disease. A chi-square (&#967;2) omnibus test with 2x3 contingency tables was performed to identify significant differences in the proportion of total RCT, SR, MA, and EE publications between CRS, asthma, and DM groups. Significant global tests were followed with bivariate subgroup testing was complete to identify differences between CRS, asthma, and DM groups.\nResults\n\nVolume of publications\nThe literature review demonstrated large disparities in volume of publications between CRS, asthma, and DM (Table&#160;2). There were 1,171 articles that overlapped with both CRS and asthma, which represented 15% of the CRS volume and 0.9% of the asthma volume. When evaluating the proportion of research dedicated to high-level evidence (ie. RCTs, SRs, MAs, and EEs), there were differences in the proportions of RCTs, SRs, and MAs published between groups (all <0.018)(Table&#160;2).Table 2\nPublications per chronic disease between 1970 -2014\n\nChronic disease\n\nCrude number of publications\n\nRCTs (% of total publications)\n\nSRs (% of total publications)\n\nMAs (% of total publications)\n\nEEs (% of total publications)\n\nCRS\n7,962296 (3.7%)227 (2.9%)42 (0.5%)8 (0.1%)\nAsthma\n136,6528,192 (6.0%)3,370 (2.5%)746 (0.5%)299 (0.2%)\nDM\n337,41113,633 (4.0%)7,177 (2.1%)2,068 (0.6%)685 (0.2%)p-value&#967;2&#8201;=&#8201;862.4; p&#8201;<&#8201;0.001&#967;2&#8201;=&#8201;65.2; p&#8201;<&#8201;0.001&#967;2&#8201;=&#8201;8.0; p&#8201;=&#8201;0.018&#967;2&#8201;=&#8201;5.6; p&#8201;=&#8201;0.062CRS, chronic rhinosinusitis; RCTs, randomized controlled trials; SRs, systematic reviews; MAs, meta-analyses; EE, economic evaluations.The bivariate analysis demonstrated that for the RCTs, there is a significant difference between CRS and asthma (3.7% vs. 6.0%; &#967;2&#8201;=&#8201;70.6; p&#8201;<&#8201;0.001) as well as asthma and DM (6.0% vs. 4.0%; &#967;2&#8201;=&#8201;845.8; p&#8201;<&#8201;0.001), but not any significant difference between the CRS and DM groups (3.7% vs. 4.0%; &#967;2&#8201;=&#8201;2.1; p&#8201;=&#8201;0.148). This indicated that the asthma literature produced the largest proportion of RCTs compared to CRS and DM.For SRs, there is a significant difference between CRS and asthma groups (2.9% vs. 2.5%; &#967;2&#8201;=&#8201;4.6; p&#8201;=&#8201;0.032) as well as CRS and DM groups (2.9% vs. 2.1%; &#967;2&#8201;=&#8201;19.4; p&#8201;<&#8201;0.001) and asthma and DM groups (2.5% vs. 2.1%; &#967;2&#8201;=&#8201;51.4; p&#8201;<&#8201;0.001). This indicates that the CRS literature contained the largest proportion of SRs followed by asthma and then DM.For MAs, there is no significant difference between CRS and asthma groups (0.5% vs. 0.5%; &#967;2&#8201;=&#8201;0.5; p&#8201;=&#8201;0.828), CRS and DM groups (0.5% vs. 0.6%; &#967;2&#8201;=&#8201;0.9; p&#8201;=&#8201;0.334) but there is a significant difference between asthma and DM groups (0.5% vs. 0.6%; &#967;2&#8201;=&#8201;7.4; p&#8201;=&#8201;0.007). This indicates that the DM and CRS literature produced similar proportions of MAs to each other but a larger proportion compared to asthma.For EEs, there is a significant difference between CRS and asthma groups (0.1% vs. 0.2%; &#967;2&#8201;=&#8201;4.9; p&#8201;=&#8201;0.026), as well as between the CRS and DM groups (0.1% vs. 0.2%; &#967;2&#8201;=&#8201;4.1; p&#8201;=&#8201;0.043), however no significant difference between the asthma and DM groups (0.2% vs. 0.2%; &#967;2&#8201;=&#8201;1.2; p&#8201;=&#8201;0.279). This indicates that the DM and asthma literature produced similar proportions of EEs to each other but a larger proportion compared to CRS.\nChanges in publication volume with time\nWhen evaluating the proportion of research publications per year (between 1970 and 2014), the disparities in volume appear to be consistent over time between CRS, asthma, and DM (Figure&#160;1A and B). There appears to be an exponential increase in the volume of CRS-related publications over the last 15&#160;years (Figure&#160;1C).Figure 1\nPublications per year. (A) DM vs. Asthma vs. CRS; (B) Asthma vs. CRS; (C) CRS alone.\nDiscussion\nMeasuring and reporting of medical outcomes using research publications is an important factor to drive quality improvement in health care [21,22]. This review has demonstrated a large disparity in the volume of research publications between CRS, asthma, and DM. Despite having similar prevalence rates, CRS had 6% and 2% of the publication volume compared to asthma and DM, respectively. Although there were minor differences in the proportion of high quality publications (RCTs, SRs, MAs, and EEs), the tremendous gap in overall number of publications is concerning given the fact that CRS results in similar negative impacts on quality of life [9] and economic burden [10,11] to that of asthma and DM (Table&#160;3).Table 3\nUtility, DALY, and economic comparisons between CRS, asthma and DM\n\nChronic disease\n\nHealth state utility (SF-6D derived)\n\nDisability weight\n\nAnnual direct health care cost\n\nAnnual indirect cost\n\nCRS\n0.65 [9]Not defined$3,143/patient [23]\na$10,500/patient [10]\nAsthma\n0.70 [19]\nb0.009 [24]$4,081/patient [25]\nd$5,846/patient [25]\nc0.027 [24]\nDM\n0.68 [20]0.015 [26]$7,900/patient [27]$3,920/patient [27](Note: all values were adjusted with an inflation calculator to reflect 2014 USD).DALY, disability adjusted life years; CRS, chronic rhinosinusitis; DM, diabetes mellitus; SF, short-form.\naThis indirect cost reflects patients with refractory CRS who were recruited from a tertiary level centre and likely over-estimates the mean indirect cost for all patients with CRS.\nbThis is the disability weight for &#8216;controlled asthma&#8217;.\ncThis is the disability weight for &#8216;partially controlled asthma&#8217;.\ndThis indirect cost reflects patients with severe asthma and likely overestimates the mean indirect cost for all patients with asthma.Research priority setting has focused on burden of disease to justify resource allocation [5,6]. However, without adequate support and awareness, certain medical conditions may be inappropriately under-researched relative to its burden of disease on society. Based on the outcomes from this study, CRS is an example of a highly prevalent chronic condition that is being under-researched given its well-documented negative impacts. This raises the question of: &#8220;Why is CRS being under-researched given its large burden of disease on society?&#8221;.Although the answer to the above question is likely multi-factorial, one important factor may be the general lack of awareness of CRS in the medical community, as was discussed in a recent article by Tan et al. titled &#8220;Chronic Rhinosinusitis: The Unrecognized Epidemic&#8221; [28]. This is highlighted by a recent multi-national study intended to quantify the burden of disease for 291 medical conditions around the globe [29]. This study evaluated common chronic diseases such as DM, asthma, coronary artery disease, hypertension, neck pain, osteoarthritis and migraine but failed to include CRS on the list of conditions. The omission of CRS from an international evaluation of burden of disease highlights the lack of awareness for this condition.Despite CRS failing to be included in two recent multi-national studies quantifying burden of disease [29,30], the high prevalence rate should provide a strong incentive to include CRS in future discussions on research prioritization. The lowest estimate of CRS prevalence is 5%, which came from a 2003 Canadian survey of 73,364 people who were asked &#8220;if they have sinusitis diagnosed by a health professional&#8221;. Although asking patients for physician diagnosed CRS increases the sensitivity by reducing false positives, it will likely result in an underestimate due to missing people who have not sought medical care for their CRS. This is in contrast to the highest estimate of 12% from the 2014 US National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) which asked patients if they had &#8216;sinusitis&#8217; rather then asking specifically about whether or not a physician diagnosed their sinusitis. The estimate from the US study will be more specific by increasing the true negative rate, however, it may include false positives such as patients with acute rhinosinusitis or other non-sinus diseases that mimic CRS such as migraines. In 2011 the Global Allergy and Asthma European Network (GA2LEN) applied a strict symptom-based approach using the European Position Paper on Rhinosinusitis and nasal Polyps (EP3OS) diagnostic criteria to estimate the prevalence of CRS in Europe. This study surveyed 57,128 people from 12 European countries and demonstrated the mean prevalence of CRS was 10.9% (range: 6.9 to 27.1%). Using the strict EP3OS symptom-based diagnostic criteria will reduce the false positive rate while maximizing the true negative rate thus increasing both the specificity and sensitivity of the CRS prevalence. Despite the inherent challenges with providing an exact prevalence estimate, the true prevalence rate for CRS in North America and Europe likely falls between 5% and 12% which is similar to asthma and DM (Table&#160;1).In addition to overall prevalence, the associations between CRS and reduced quality of life and economic burden are other important factors to consider. When comparing health state utility values of patients living with CRS, asthma and DM, the values appear to be similar when using the SF-6D instrument (Table&#160;3). Furthermore, when considering the direct and indirect costs of each of these chronic diseases, DM appears to have larger direct health care costs compared to CRS, however, the indirect cost of refractory CRS is substantially higher then DM. The differences between direct and indirect costs of CRS and DM may reflect increased public awareness of DM resulting in patients seeking more medical therapy. As opposed to CRS, which may not have the same public or physician awareness and result in a substantial proportion of the population failing to receive appropriate medical treatments. The disparities in direct and indirect health care costs between CRS, asthma, and DM warrant future research.A second potential reason for the disparity in publication volume may include a perception that CRS is a sub-specialty topic, which makes it challenging to publish research in higher impact journals that have a broader audience. This perception may deter basic science, clinical, or pharmacoeconomic researchers from adopting CRS as their academic focus despite tremendous opportunities to provide meaningful contributions. Thirdly, as opposed to CRS, untreated cases of asthma and DM may result in mortality. Although CRS has similar QoL reductions and indirect costs, the difference in mortality risk may have lead researchers to focus on asthma and DM. Lastly, there are fewer rhinologists to perform CRS research compared to the number of general internists, endocrinologists, or pulmonologists, who perform research for asthma and DM. However, given that CRS represents 1-2% of primary care physician visits [23,31], is associated with comorbid allergies in 20 to 60% of cases [32,33], and is commonly associated with asthma outcomes [34,35], CRS research should not only be conducted by rhinologists, but by primary care physicians, allergists, pulmonologists, and general internists. Efforts to increase awareness for the importance of CRS to these medical specialties may help reduce the disparity in publicationsThis article was intended to evaluate the overall disparities in publication volume between CRS, asthma, and DM. One limitation of this study is the inclusion of one biomedical database (Ovid MEDLINE) which may result in missing certain publications from each category of chronic disease. However, when the EMBASE database was included in the initial search it yielded the same proportion of publication volume, with CRS containing 2% and 6% of the total publication volume as DM and asthma, respectively. Thus, to keep the search strategy and outcomes simple and reproducible, one database was searched to highlight the disparities in publication volume.\nConclusion\nThis review has demonstrated a large disparity in the volume of published research for CRS compared to asthma and DM. Given the similarities in prevalence rates, impact on quality of life and economic burden, the relative under supply of research should prompt efforts to improve research prioritization for CRS.

The aim of the study was to evaluate individual survivor priority of various general and health-related domains of life and their satisfaction with these domains. Furthermore, we investigated the impact of general and health-related LS on resilience, anxiety, depression and quality of life in AML survivors following alloSCT.Methods\nForty-one AML survivors (median age at time of assessment&#8201;=&#8201;49.0&#160;years) who had undergone alloSCT (median time since transplantation&#8201;=&#8201;3.1&#160;years) were enrolled in the study. Psychosocial parameters were assessed using the following instruments: FLZM (Questions on Life Satisfaction), EORTC QLQ-C30, HADS (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) and the RS-25 (Resilience Scale-25 items). Correlation analyses were computed to reveal the associations between the different questionnaires.Results\nIndependence from help or care, well-regulated living conditions and financial security contributed positively to LS, whereas being off work due to health-reasons and dissatisfaction with physical aspects were negatively associated to the subjective feelings of overall satisfaction. Moreover, a high quality of life was strongly positively correlated with LS (Spearman&#8217;s rho general LS: 0.643 and health-related LS: 0.726, both p&#8201;<&#8201;0.001). A high degree of resilience was also strongly positively correlated with better LS (general LS: 0.700, health-related LS: 0.675, both p&#8201;<&#8201;0.001). Symptoms of anxiety and depression were associated with an impaired general LS (anxiety: &#8722;0.674, depression: &#8722;0.698, both p&#8201;<&#8201;0.001).Conclusions\nOur results indicate that LS should be considered an important key contributor to the survivors&#8217; well-being following alloSCT. Thus, identifying protective psychological and physical factors that relieve stressors is of high importance in order to support long-term AML survivors with their special needs.", "body": "Background\nDue to continuous optimization of chemotherapy and supportive care, the prognosis for patients suffering from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has steadily improved over the last decades. As a consequence of these improvements, the quality of life of patients has become an important parameter to assess [1]. Aggressive treatment protocols can cause somatic late effects as well as psychosocial disorders [2-7]. Thus, a major challenge remains in the facilitation of an effective treatment that is also associated with a reliable, high quality of life.To date, only a few studies have analyzed quality of life in AML survivors following alloSCT [8-10]. Messerer et al. demonstrated that due to a lack of studies concerning long-term follow-up, the relevance of the survivors&#8217; quality of life often remains unclear. The authors postulated a significantly worse long-term impact of alloSCT on quality of life compared to conventional chemotherapy [11]. Grulke et al. analyzed quality of life before and after autologous or allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation from 33 publications which included about 2800 patients. Their results showed that quality of life decreased directly following transplantation, increased as date of discharge approached and continued to improve thereafter. Quality of life levels measured a year later were comparable to those measured a few weeks prior to transplantation [12].The EORTC QLQ-C30 is the most widely used questionnaire in Europe that assesses quality of life in cancer patients [13]. Unfortunately, the advancement of research regarding the quality of life of adult AML survivors following alloSCT is slow [14]. It is possible that the EORTC QLQ-C30 core questionnaire provides only limited insight into the quality of life in cancer survivors. Kopp et al. reported that the EORTC QLQ-C30 affords insight that concerns mainly the physical aspects of quality of life and helps to identify symptoms, which decrease quality of life from the patients&#8217; perspective [15]. However, some additional aspects of the quality of life concept still need to be addressed. Survivors&#8217; self-assessed priority of and their satisfaction with various life domains often remain unclear [16]. The Questions on Life SatisfactionModules (FLZM) is a validated questionnaire for assessing general and health-related quality of life [17]. The specific feature of this multidimensional construct is that it distinguishes between a person&#8217;s individual priority of multiple life domains and his/her own subjective satisfaction within each domain. The respondent evaluates each item twice, once for the subjective importance of the various aspects of general life and health conditions, and once for the degree of satisfaction in this domain. These two ratings are combined into a weighted satisfaction score. Presently, the multidimensional FLZM is a well-established tool used to measure LS in different oncological settings. [18-21]. To our knowledge, no study has yet been published on specific analysis of self-reported LS by using the FLZM in AML-survivors after alloSCT. We have therefore implemented the FLZM questionnaire, which provides a better understanding of survivors&#8217; special needs.Furthermore, psychological resilience, general living conditions and current life situations are rarely investigated. However, resilience could play an important role in addressing issues relating to the survivors&#180; satisfaction with life. Results of a study by Schumacher et al. revealed a strong correlation of resilience with quality of life [22].Psychosocial care should no longer only focus on a limited number of psychological needs. In order to gain a better understanding of patients&#180; needs, it is important to identify a broader spectrum of psychological and social factors influencing patients&#180; well-being. Filtering key areas of need should be the first step to develop effective support care [23]. Using additional assessment tools, and thus gaining more extensive information concerning special issues, may help to develop a more accurate and systematic response to the urgent needs of individual patients.Therefore, our cross-sectional study aimed at assessing LS by implementing the less commonly used FLZM questionnaire in long-term survivors who had received alloSCT and had been in complete remission for at least six months prior to evaluation. Since FLZM comparative data are available, we also compared our AML specific study sample with normative data from a representative German sample and with data from other cancer patients. In this way we expected to obtain a better insight into survivors&#8217; importance rates and the satisfaction of their needs. Secondly, we investigated the association between LS within the FLZM and additional psychological factors such as resilience, anxiety, depression and quality of life by using other well-established questionnaires within the same study sample. In doing so we analyzed the ability of the FLZM to integrate with the other instrument tools, therefore enabling the use of the FLZM as an insightful and informative additional questionnaire. In addition, information on social issues, demographic and work-related variables was included. The findings of our study will help to identify important information regarding the special needs associated with AML cancer survivors after alloSCT.\nMethods\n\nInstruments\nThe following instruments were used: Questionnaire on Life Satisfaction FLZM [17] (in the original German: FLZ-M, Fragen zur Lebenszufriedenheit Module), Quality of Life Questionnaire EORTC QLQ-C30 [24,25], Resilience Scale RS-25 [26,27] and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale HADS [28,29]. The questionnaires are well-established evaluation tools used in psychological research.In Questions on Life Satisfaction FLZM, subjects assess their subjective general and health-related LS based on the subjective importance of certain aspects of multiple life domains and the satisfaction within these domains. Both modules consist of eight dimensions. The general module addresses the following: &#8216;friends/acquaintances&#8217;, &#8216;leisure time/hobbies&#8217;, &#8216;health&#8217;, &#8216;income/financial security&#8217;, &#8216;occupation/work&#8217;, &#8216;housing/living conditions&#8217;, &#8216;family life/children&#8217; and &#8216;partner relationship/sexuality&#8217;. The health-related module addresses these issues: &#8216;physical condition/fitness&#8217;, &#8216;ability to relax/stay on an even keel&#8217;, &#8216;energy/zest for life&#8217;, &#8216;mobility (e.g., walking, driving)&#8217;, &#8216;vision and hearing&#8217;, &#8216;freedom from anxiety&#8217;, &#8216;freedom from aches and pains&#8217; and &#8216;independence from help/care&#8217;. For each dimension, the assessment is completed in two steps: First, the subjects rate their subjective importance of each dimension on a scale of 1 (&#8216;not important&#8217;) to 5 (&#8216;extremely important&#8217;). Secondly, they assess their satisfaction with each dimension on a scale of 1 (&#8216;dissatisfied&#8217;) to 5 (&#8216;very satisfied&#8217;). The ratings for importance and satisfaction in each dimension are combined into a weighted satisfaction score by calculating the formula: weighted satisfaction&#8201;=&#8201;(importance rating &#8211; 1) &#215; (2 &#215; satisfaction rating &#8211; 5). Possible dimension-specific weighted scores range from &#8722;12 to 20. Means and standard deviations were calculated for the weighted scores of each dimension. The two FLZM total scores, i.e. the general LS and health-related LS scores, are calculated by summing up the eight general and eight health-related scores. The total scores range from &#8722;96 to 160. Negative scores indicate dissatisfaction; positive scores indicate satisfaction of the specific dimension. The higher the score, the higher the subjective importance and individuals&#8217; LS. Zero indicates no subjective importance [17]. The internal consistency as measure of the reliability for the FLZM General and FLZM Health total scores was shown to be high (Cronbach&#8217;s alpha&#8201;=&#8201;0.82 and 0.89, respectively) [17,30]. In our study sample, internal consistency was also good with a Cronbach&#8217;s alpha of 0.83 for the general and 0.90 for the health-related module.The EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30 Version 3.0) consists of five functional scales (&#8216;physical&#8217;, &#8216;role&#8217;, &#8216;emotional&#8217;, &#8216;cognitive&#8217; and &#8216;social&#8217;). Three symptom scales, and six single items assess specific side effects. The &#8216;global quality of life scale&#8217;, consists of two items &#8216;How would you rate your overall health during the past week?&#8217; and &#8216;How would you rate your overall quality of life during the past week?&#8217; [24]. Raw scores are linearly transformed into scores ranging from 0 to 100, with a high score representing a higher response level. Thus, a high score in the functioning scales and the global quality of life scale indicates a high level of functioning, whereas a high score for a symptom scale or item reflects a high level of symptomatology [25]. The QLQ-C30 has been tested in EORTC filed studies [24] and is nowadays a very well validated instrument. In our study the reliabilities were acceptable or excellent: Cronbach&#8217;s alpha&#8201;=&#8201;0.77 (physical), 0.86 (role), 0.90 (emotional), 0.86 (cognitive), 0.85 (social), fatigue (0.84), 0.93 (pain) and 0.89 (global scale). The reliability of fatigue was not comparable, because of missing values in our study sample.The Resilience Scale (RS-25) (German Version) was originally developed by Gail M. Wagnild and Heather M. Young [27]. Items are scored on a seven-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (&#8216;strongly disagree&#8217;) to 7 (&#8216;strongly agree&#8217;). The total score is calculated by summing up the 25 items of the resilience scale. Possible sum scores range from 25 to 175, with higher scores reflecting higher resilience [27]. Internal consistency of the German version of the RS-25 Scale [26] was evaluated in a large community sample of the German population (n&#8201;=&#8201;2031, aged 4&#8211;95 years) with a high Cronbach&#8217;s alpha of 0.95. In the current study, Cronbach&#8217;s alpha was 0.91 for the whole scale.The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) (German Version) [29] was originally developed by Zigmond and Snaith [28]. Each of the 14 question items, seven for each subscale, is a four point (0&#8211;3) category. The overall possible sum scores range from 0 to 21 for anxiety as well as for depression. Lower scores (0&#8211;7) indicate clinical stability; whereas higher positive scores (greater or equal to 11) suggest potential need for psychiatric treatment.The well-validated German version of the HADS showed acceptable internal consistencies for both scales [29,31]. In our study, internal consistency was good (Cronbach&#8217;s alpha of 0.86 for both the depression and anxiety scale) and excellent for the whole scale of the HADS: Cronbach&#8217;s alpha&#8201;=&#8201;0.92.Clinical data from survivors such as type of AML, age at diagnosis and randomized induction regime were provided by the central database of the study office. In addition, general data about survivors&#8217; current life situation were collected, including socio-demographic characteristics such as age, sex, education, income, marital status and actual size of household, respectively.\nSetting and population\nThis quality of life study is based on a subgroup of AML survivors who had previously undergone treatment according to protocol of the multicenter clinical AML Cooperative Group (AMLCG 99) trial for newly diagnosed primary AML [32]. Inclusion criteria for the quality of life study were: 1. AML patients were 16&#8211;60 years of age at time of initial diagnosis and had already received conditioning therapy. 2. Patients achieved first complete remission following conditioning treatment and 3. Subsequent alloSCT was performed at least 6&#160;months prior to assessment. Taking these criteria into account, 84 eligible patients were deemed suitable for quality of life assessment. These patients were treated at 27 various German cancer centers. They received transplantation between December 1999 and August 2005. We knowingly accepted the relatively long period between time of transplant and assessment due to the pilot character of the study. The AMLCG 99 trial was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Muenster (Muenster, Germany) and was conducted in accordance with the ethical standards established in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments. Survivors meeting inclusion criteria for the quality of life study were informed by clinicians from their respective clinical centers. Written informed consent was given by all survivors prior to trial inclusion. The quality of life assessment was conducted in an outpatient setting.\nData collection\nData were collected from June 2006 to March 2007. One patient was untraceable due to unknown address. Three patients were not contacted due either to serious psychological difficulties, premature withdrawal, or relapse. Therefore, the questionnaires including a separate information letter regarding the quality of life study were sent to the remaining 80 patients with a pre-addressed, pre-paid, return postage label. Survivors expressed their consent by voluntarily completing the questionnaires and returning them via post to the study office. 41 survivors complied, representing a response rate of 51%.\nData analyses\nData collection, transformation and the statistical analyses of the data were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics 20.0 for Windows (IBM Corporation, Somers, NY, USA) and SAS software, Version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).To examine a potential effect between LS and assessment on global quality of life, resilience, anxiety and depression, rank correlations were calculated using the method of Spearman [33]. Correlation coefficients were interpreted using the scale provided by Salkin, where an r between 0.8 and 1.0 is defined as &#8216;very strong&#8217;, between 0.6 and 0.8 as &#8216;strong&#8217;, between 0.4 and 0.6 as &#8216;moderate&#8217;, between 0.2 and 0.4 as &#8216;weak&#8217; and between 0.0 and 0.2 as &#8216;very weak&#8217; or &#8216;no relationship&#8217; [34]. In order to guarantee comparability with normative data and other samples, group comparisons regarding the FLZM total scores are presented as mean with standard deviation, otherwise medians with interquartile ranges (IQR) are presented.Nevertheless, in order to do justice to that effort with the relatively small study sample size, FLZM total scores (e.g. general LS, health-related LS) were compared between categorical groups using non-parametric Mann&#8211;Whitney U test [35,36] for two group comparisons, whereas the Kruskal-Wallis test was performed on three or more groups [37]. Differences between proportions were analyzed using Fisher&#8217;s exact test [38]. Inferential statistics are intended to be exploratory (hypotheses generating), not confirmatory, and are interpreted accordingly. P-values are considered statistically significant in case p&#8201;<&#8201;0.05.\nResults\n\nStudy sample\nWe identified a total of 41 AML survivors, aged 23&#8211;66 years at time of assessment, who fulfilled the questionnaires. Among those, 44% were men (n&#8201;=&#8201;18) and 56% of the participants were women (n&#8201;=&#8201;23). With regard to age at time of assessment, there were no significant age differences between men and women (median: 47.0 vs. 49.0, p&#8201;=&#8201;0.636; data not shown). At the time of diagnosis, 66% of the participants had de novo AML (n&#8201;=&#8201;27), 29% suffered from secondary AML (n&#8201;=&#8201;12) and 5% had high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (n&#8201;=&#8201;2). Participating survivors were followed up with a median of 3.1&#160;years post alloSCT (ranged from 8&#160;months to 7&#160;years).Table&#160;1 summarizes the characteristics in a comparison between participants and survivors who declined participation in the quality of life study. There were no significant differences between participants and non-participants regarding sex, age at diagnosis, type of conditioning treatment, donor or occurrence of graft-versus-host disease. Differences were found between the two groups regarding type of hematological disease: a higher proportion of participants than non-participants had secondary AML and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (p&#8201;=&#8201;0.022). Its participating survivors were slightly older than the survivors who declined participation (median: 49.0 vs. 44.0; p&#8201;=&#8201;0.046).Table 1\nCharacteristics of the AML survivors (n&#8201;=&#8201;80)\n\nSurvivors contacted for the quality of life study\n\nParticipating survivors (P)\n\nSurvivors who declined participation (NP)\n\np\n-value\n\nP vs. NP\n\nNo of survivors\n804139\nSex, N (%)0.509Male38 (47)18 (44)20 (51)Female42 (53)23 (56)19 (49)\nAge at diagnosis (years)42.043.040.00.070Median (IQRb)(34.0&#8201;&#8722;&#8201;49.0)(37.0&#8201;&#8722;&#8201;51.0)(32.0&#8201;&#8722;&#8201;47.0)\nAge at time of assessment (years)45.549.044.00.046Median (IQR)(38.0&#8201;&#8722;&#8201;52.5)(41.0&#8201;&#8722;&#8201;54.0)(38.0&#8201;&#8722;&#8201;49.0)\nType of AML, N (%)0.022De Novo AML62 (77)27 (66)35 (90)Secondary AMLa\n15 (19)12 (29)3 (8)High-risk myelodysplastic syndrome3 (4)2 (5)1 (3)\nInduction therapy, N (%)0.509TAD-HAM38 (47)18 (44)20 (51)HAM-HAM42 (53)23 (56)19 (49)\nTime interval since alloSCT (years)3.3 (2.4&#8201;&#8722;&#8201;4.8)3.1 (2.4&#8201;&#8722;&#8201;4.2)3.7 (2.5&#8201;&#8722;&#8201;5.3)0.191Median (IQR)\nDonor, N (%)0.062Related58 (72)26 (63)32 (82)Unrelated22 (28)15 (37)7 (18)\nHLA\nc, N (%)0.258Matched73 (91)39 (95)34 (87)Mismatched7 (9)2 (5)5 (13)\nGvHD\nd\nafter transplantation, N (%)1.000Yes52 (68)26 (67)26 (68)No25 (32)13 (33)12 (32)\naSecondary AML included AML after myelodysplastic syndrome or therapy-related AML.\nbIQR&#8201;=&#8201;Interquartile range.\ncHLA&#8201;=&#8201;human leukocyte antigen. dGvHD&#8201;=&#8201;graft-versus-host-disease.\nSurvivors\u2019 general and health-related LS\nFigure&#160;1 shows the weighted LS mean scores of the study population for the eight different dimensions, separated by the general and health-related modules. Analysis of the general life domains showed that the study participants were most satisfied with their &#8216;housing/living conditions&#8217; (mean&#8201;=&#8201;9.5), closely followed by &#8216;family life/children&#8217; (mean&#8201;=&#8201;9.2) and &#8216;health&#8217; (mean&#8201;=&#8201;8.3). By contrast, the minimum weighted LS value were found for &#8216;occupation/work&#8217; (mean&#8201;=&#8201;2.5), followed by &#8216;income/financial security&#8217; (mean&#8201;=&#8201;3.3). When investigating the different dimensions of the health-related module, participants were most satisfied with their &#8216;independence from help/care&#8217; (mean&#8201;=&#8201;14.7), followed at some distance by &#8216;mobility&#8217; (mean&#8201;=&#8201;9.9) and &#8216;vision and hearing&#8217; (mean&#8201;=&#8201;8.9). Here, the participants were less satisfied with their &#8216;physical condition/fitness&#8217; (mean&#8201;=&#8201;4.0), followed by &#8216;ability to relax/stay on an even keel&#8217; (mean&#8201;=&#8201;5.7).Figure 1\nLife satisfaction as measured by the FLZ\nM\n. Group means with 1-fold standard deviations (displayed in brackets) are reported (n&#8201;=&#8201;41). The distances from the center point indicate the weighted scores of each item. The marked area enclosed between the eight items represents the total general or health-related life satisfaction within the study group.\nCorrelations between the FLZ\nCorrelations between weighted general and health-related LS and the other parameters were computed. The global quality of life scale (2-item) of the QLQ-C30 showed a strong correlation with survivors&#8217; weighted LS (Spearman&#8217;s rho r&#8201;=&#8201;0.643 for general LS and r&#8201;=&#8201;0.726 for health-related LS; both p&#8201;<&#8201;0.001). Furthermore, there was a strong positive correlation between &#8216;emotional functioning&#8217; and the general LS (r&#8201;=&#8201;0.687) and a moderate correlation with the health-related LS (r&#8201;=&#8201;0.564), both p&#8201;<&#8201;0.001. &#8216;Physical-&#8217;, &#8216;cognitive-&#8217; and &#8216;role functioning&#8217; correlated moderately with survivors&#8217; LS for both FLZM total scores (general LS: r&#8201;=&#8201;0.529, r&#8201;=&#8201;0.539, r&#8201;=&#8201;0.580; all p&#8201;<&#8201;0.001; health-related LS: r&#8201;=&#8201;0.599, r&#8201;=&#8201;0.545, r&#8201;=&#8201;0.554; all p&#8201;<&#8201;0.001). &#8216;Social functioning&#8217; also correlated moderately with general LS (r&#8201;=&#8201;0.515; p&#8201;&#8201;0.05). HADS anxiety and depression scores showed a strong negative correlation with survivors&#8217; general LS (anxiety: r&#8201;=&#8201;&#8722;0.674, depression: r&#8201;=&#8201;&#8722;0.698; both p&#8201;<&#8201;0.001). A similar negative effect was seen for correlation with health-related LS (anxiety: r&#8201;=&#8201;&#8722;0.536, depression: r&#8201;=&#8201;&#8722;0.739; both p&#8201;<&#8201;0.001). In contrast, a strong positive correlation was found for LS with resilience (general LS: r&#8201;=&#8201;0.700, health-related LS: r&#8201;=&#8201;0.675; both p&#8201;<&#8201;0.001).

The largest association was observed for employment status. Survivors who had retired for health reasons or were currently on sick leave had significantly worse health-related LS (p&#8201;=&#8201;0.033). Moreover, in secondary AML the average scores for general LS and health-related LS were noticeable lower (33.8 and 44.9, respectively) than in de novo AML (57.8 and 69.5, respectively). Not surprisingly, younger people tend to have better health-related LS and, as can be expected, decline with growing age. No significant effects on LS were found for the other sociodemographic factors.Table 3\nFLZ\nM\n-general LS and FLZ\nM\n-health LS total scores for the AML survivors study sample by sociodemograhic and clinical factors\n\nn\n*\n\nFLZ\nM\ngeneral LS\n\np\n-value\n\nFLZ\nM\nhealth\n\np\n-value\n\nTotal\n4050.7 (39.1)64.9 (48.0)\nAge at diagnosis (years)400.645 [&#8722;0.612;1.902]a\n0.305b\n&#8722;0.412 [&#8722;1.959; 1.136]a\n0.593b\n\nAge at time of evaluation (years)400.601 [&#8722;0.635;1.838]a\n0.331b\n&#8722;0.610 [&#8722;2.127; 0.907]a\n0.420b\n\nTime interval since alloSCT (years)40&#8722;0.081 [&#8722;8.409;8.247]a\n0.984b\n&#8722;6.338 [&#8722;16.197;3.521]a\n0.201b\n\nSex\n0.5420.702Male1846.3 (50.6)59.4 (54.3)Female2254.1 (28.2)67.5 (43.1)\nType of AML\n0.2720.096De Novo AML2757.8 (38.4)9.5 (51.5)Secondary AML1133.8 (41.1)44.9 (37.8)High-risk myelodysplastic syndrome239.0 (15.6)92.0 (0)\nMarital status\n0.4660.717Not married937.1 (47.4)66.6 (47.5)Married2452.0 (39.9)56.8 (54.3)Separated/Divorced/Widowed763.0 (28.4)80.3 (22.7)\nEmployment status\n0.2380.033Full-time965.6 (30.7)86.8 (24.2)Part-time/Marginal657.2 (47.5)86.5 (38.2)Currently off work due to illness457.5 (30.7)37.5 (68.3)Retired for health reasons1124.8 (44.9)25.8 (48.6)Unemployed/Other858.6 (35.2)76.9 (35.1)\nEducational level\n0.0990.070Low (elementary school)2141.9 (43.1)50.7 (46.4)Middle (secondary school)1074.5 (27.2)82.9 (52.4)High (grammar school)430.5 (34.5)52.5 (58.9)University457.0 (35.3)91.0 (8.8)*Sample size varies due to missing or incomplete data.\naRegression coefficient beta with 95% confidence interval.\nbp-value determines whether or not the null hypothesis that a particular predictor's regression coefficient is zero can be rejected.Note: unless otherwise specified, means with 1-fold standard deviation are reported.\nDiscussion\nAs scientific and medical progress in alloSCT are likely to increase the number of long-term survivors, these survivors are faced with lasting physical and psychosocial problems related to transplantation. In order to offer each individual patient the maximum physical and psychological advantage following this intensive therapy, it is important to examine and identify protective psychosocial factors [22]. The survivor&#8217;s individual priority of various life domains and their satisfaction with these domains often remain unclear. This necessitates the need to know in detail how satisfied a person is with a specific aspect of life, as well as how important this aspect is to that person. Therefore, the main focus of our study was the assessment of LS in long-term AML survivors who underwent alloSCT.In our study, we detected different levels of survivors&#8217; importance and satisfaction for a variety of life domains. In terms of the general LS, we found the largest values in &#8216;housing/living conditions&#8217; and &#8216;family life children&#8217;. This not only means that housing situation and family structure are of great importance for the majority of the AML survivors, but that they also report a very high satisfaction in these two specific life domains. The lowest values were found for the domains &#8216;income/financial security&#8217; and &#8216;occupation/work&#8217;. This ranking seems to confirm that being employed and ensuring a good steady income are one of the most important aspects of life, yet a high proportion of the study group are dissatisfied with their employment conditions. Differences in health-related LS were also reflected when comparing the occupational status among SCT survivors: unemployment due to illness or retirement for health reasons had a significantly negative impact on health-related LS. Our finding is in line with a study from Sweden concerning adult survivors with a former hematological disease and a median follow up of 8&#160;years post alloSCT [39]. The authors stated that being employed is an important goal after alloSCT. In general, employment is associated with better well-being among survivors previously treated with hematopoietic SCT [40]. Other studies also show that the most prevalent problems among SCT survivors included concerns about keeping their job, worries that they will need to take a disability pension or a paid leave of absence [41]. This financial and employment stress leads many survivors to a poorer quality of life [40,42-44]. It should be noted that more than half of the participants (56%) of our study sample were unemployed at time of follow up which may explain the great impact on the survivors&#8217; dissatisfaction with their financial status. Moreover, domains of the health-related LS showed a high degree of satisfaction among &#8216;independence from help/care&#8217; and &#8216;mobility&#8217;, whereas survivors&#8217; LS was most negatively affected by &#8216;physical condition/fitness&#8217;. However, physical fitness limitations are a commonly known side effect, especially among survivors following SCT [45-47]. Other studies noted that a substantial percentage of AML patients had difficulties with physical activities. In Zittoun et al. 49% out of a total of 35 alloSCT patients in complete remission still reported difficulties in taking a long walk or doing work or household jobs [7]. Furthermore, it is not surprising that survivors are not completely satisfied in the domains that reflect psychological components, such as &#8216;ability to relax/stay on an even keel&#8217; , &#8216;freedom from anxiety&#8217;, &#8216;energy/zest for life&#8217; and &#8216;freedom from aches and pains&#8217;. This may reflect the survivors&#8217; greater risk for symptoms of anxiety and depression following an aggressive cancer therapy. Consistent with previous studies assessing the impact of psychological distress on quality of life for hematological cancer survivors, higher levels of psychological morbidity (e.g. anxiety and depression) were associated with survivors reporting lower satisfaction with health [40,48,49].In direct comparison to a study with a representative sample of the German population by Henrich and Herschbach [17], in our study sample the FLZM general LS total scores were on average about 10 scores lower than the representative sample (mean with standard deviation, sample size): 60.5 (37.3, n&#8201;=&#8201;2534) vs. 50.7 (39.1). For the FLZM Health LS the total scores were equally lower in the study sample than in the representative sample: 74.4 (41.5) vs. 64.9 (48.0). As of yet, there are no directly comparable values for the FLZM in survivors suffering from AML following alloSCT. With regard to the specific eight life domains, in both the representative and the study sample, the highest impacts were observed for &#8216;housing/living condition&#8217; and &#8216;family life/children&#8217; and the lowest values in the domain &#8216;occupation/work&#8217; [17]. A similar effect can also be observed for the eight FLZM Health modules with highest value for &#8216;independence from help/care&#8217; and lowest values for &#8216;physical condition/fitness&#8217; and &#8216;ability to relax&#8217; in both samples [17].When comparing our results with the data from other cancer patients, patients under treatment scored on average slightly lower in the FLZM General LS [17]. In contrast, those cancer patients in rehabilitation or in remission assessed their life satisfaction as higher than the participants in our study.Overall, our study sample of AML survivors following alloSCT are not as satisfied with their subjective life satisfaction as the representative sample, but are more satisfied than acute cancer patients currently under treatment.The correlation of the FLZM with the other instruments demonstrates a strong or moderate positive effect of quality of life, including all functional scales of the EORTC QLQ-C30 and of the psychological well-being on survivors&#8217; LS. In contrast, the subscales anxiety and depression of the HADS, revealed a strong negative impact on survivors&#8217; LS. These results are in accordance with other studies, in which a positive correlation was found between resilience and LS, and a negative correlation with psychological stressors [16,50,51].However, with respect to survivors who were contacted, yet decided not to respond, the reasons for not participating in the quality of life study are unclear. It is possible that some of the long-term survivors no longer wanted to be confronted with their former disease. Some of them might have moved on with their lives. In fact, we had detailed information from one non-responder that he no longer wanted to think intensively about his former disease. Response rates might also be dependent on the centers&#8217; specific size and specialization. Interestingly, the survivors responding to the questionnaires were older at time of assessment and had a higher risk profile (e.g. higher age, higher rate of transplantations from unrelated donors, less de novo AML and more secondary AML and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome). Thus, it is possible that these survivors, having a generally lower quality of life, may be more motivated to answer questionnaires. Compared to older survivors, younger survivors may have been less likely to respond, due to different priorities in terms of families and job duties, which is in line with a study by Hall et al., suggested that younger survivors may be more likely to have competing time demands [43].Despite these possible explanations, all survivors were in complete remission at the time of questionnaire evaluation, and there were no significant differences in treatment-related characteristics between participants and non-participants. It should be noted, however, that our findings are restricted due to the cross-sectional design of our study. Furthermore, although the sample size was rather small for an assessment, this can be explained by the fact that being a rare disease, the recruitment of former AML patients is a limiting factor. The overall response rate was more than 50%.\nConclusion and future implications\nIn order to adequately support long-term survivors with special needs, physicians and psychologists need to look carefully at survivors&#8217; satisfaction with life and the subjective importance of specific life domains.Whereas the assessment of quality of life is increasingly common in studies, it often remains unclear how important and satisfied a specific life domain is for an individual patient. Our study indicates that the FLZM questionnaire corresponds well with other validated instruments. Our findings emphasize that the use of the FLZM provides important information, which offers a broader spectrum and more precise details of survivors&#8217; quality of life. This allows us to reach a clearer understanding of how best to identify the needs of AML survivors and will help to address such needs. Our pilot study has shown that LS in AML survivors following alloSCT is an important issue and its assessment provides valuable information and insights that affect future research. Since our study showed a substantial lack of satisfaction in terms of employment issues, physicians and psychologists should also focus their efforts on areas such as financial support services. A good example would be providing assistance for reintegration into social and professional life. Moreover, it is very important to offer interventions at the earliest possible stage of clinical care that could prevent psychological distress, and physical limitations could be addressed in the form of special fitness programs following alloSCT.", "pmid": "25888906", "title": "Factors influencing life satisfaction in acute myeloid leukemia survivors following allogeneic stem cell transplantation: a cross-sectional study", "journal_title": "Health and Quality of Life Outcomes", "authors": "Susanne Amler;Maria Cristina Sauerland;Christian Deiters;Thomas B\u00fcchner;Andrea Schumacher", "doi": "10.1186/s12955-015-0222-8", "score": "0.0038653298"}, {"keywords": "LPS;;Caco-2;;c-Src;;ERK", "abstract": "As a major component of the cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) can be released into the bloodstream to cause a spectrum of pathophysiological reactions.

In the present study, we observed that LPS directly stimulated growth of Caco-2 cells as well as enhanced the amounts of c-Src, which could be partly attributable to increased c-src transcript. Parallel to LPS-induced c-Src expression was FAK activation and ERK activation.

Introduction\nEpithelia are tissues composed of sheets of similar cells bound closely together that execute different functions such as barrier, adsorption, or secretion. In addition to physically providing the barrier against bacterial infection, epithelia also chemically emit chemotactic signals that attract blood-borne host defense cells to initiate the inflammatory responses after their injury [1]. Due to the production of similar polypeptide arsenals between the epithelial cells and the polymorphonuclear leukocytes, the former are thus thought to be important effectors of innate immunity. Though epithelial cells lining the colon are bathed in bacteria and their products, they remain refractory to the threat from the normal bacterial flora. However, encountering a diverse array of enteroinvasive bacteria, human colon epithelial cells produce not only proinflammatory cytokines, but also an autocrine growthstimulating factor, PGE2, to facilitate cellular growth [2]. These observations indicate that colorectal tumors may be formed or activated by exposure to colonic flora or by endotoxemia.The major membrane component of Gram-negative bacteria, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), is a potent inflammatory stimulus, whose release during growth or lysis of bacteria elicits a diverse array of growth factors, cytokines, and inflammatory mediators [3, 4]. With the help of various LPS binding proteins, LPS induces the activation of responsive cells such as macrophages, endothelial cells and epithelial cells [4]. LPS forms a complex with the LPS binding protein (LPB) in plasma, and the resultant LBP-LPS complexes are recognized by CD14, present either as a GPI-anchored membrane glycoprotein (mCD14), or free as a secreted molecule (sCD14) [3, 4]. Ligation of TLR4-MD2 complex induces by LPS results in activation of multiple signaling proteins including protein tyrosine kinases, members of MAPK family and transcription factors [5].c-Src is a prototype of a closely related family of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases that function as co-transducers of transmembrane signals emanating from multiple growth factor receptors [6]. To date, proteins such as focal adhesion kinase (FAK), Shc, cortactin, Eps8 and STAT3 have been established as its substrates and their participation in c-Src-mediated physiological activities including proliferation, migration, and cell survival have been established.Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the most common gastrointestinal cancer. Despite the fact that genetic events leading to its prevalence have been well documented [7], activation of c-Src has also been observed in a majority of studies [8]. Since increased c-Src kinase activity was usually associated with its upregulation, overexpression of c-Src was therefore suggested to play a critical role in colorectal tumorigenesis. Indeed, overexpression of c-Src in murine fibroblasts causes their transformation [9], and anti-sense-mediated downregulation of c-Src in colon adenocarcinoma cells reverts their tumorigenicity [10]. However, to date the precise mechanism underlying c-Src upregulation in CRC is still elusive.In the present study, we observe that LPS increases the cellular growth of Caco-2 cells. And consistent with this finding is the finding that the expression of c-Src is LPS-inducible and that results in an increase of Src-mediated Shc Tyr-317 phosphorylation, ERK, and FAK activation. Application of PP2 abrogates both LPS-induced ERK activation and cellular proliferation. Notably, this is the first report indicating how the upregulation of c-Src in colon cancer cells is achieved.\n2. Materials and methods\n\n2.1. Cell lines and lysate preparation\nThe human colon cancer cell line, Caco-2, was utilized in this study. Caco-2 cells were incubated with or without LPS (Sigma). The cells were lysed in ice-cold, modified RIPA buffer as described before [11]. Lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 g for 10 min at 4&#176;C. The protein amount in each lysate was determined by protein assay kit (Bio-Rad).\n2.2. Antibodies, immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting\nFor immunoblotting, 100 &#956;g of cell lysates were resolved in an SDS-PAGE and Western immunoblotting with antibody as indicated in the figure legend. Src monoclonal antibodies GD11 and 2-17 were generously provided by Dr. Sarah J. Parsons. Antibodies against actin, amino-terminal FAK (A17), and phosphotyrosine (PY20) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, California); and the antibody against phosphorylated Tyr- 397 of FAK was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lack Placid, NY). The E10 monoclonal antibody recognized phosphorylated Thr-202 and Tyr-204 of ERK1/2 was purchased from New England Biolabs, Inc. (Beverly, MA, USA). The rabbit polyclonal antibodies recognized unphosphorylated ERK2 were purchased from Santa Cruz. Western immunoblotting was performed with antibody of interest and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences).\n2.3. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)\nTotal RNA was isolated from Caco-2 cells by utilizing the Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) as recommended by the manufacturer. Then the RNA was quantified by spectrophotometer and an equal amount (5 &#956;g) of it was reverse-transcribed into single stranded cDNA in a 50 &#956;l reaction mixture containing reaction buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.3], 15 mM KCl, 0.6 mM MgCl2, and 2 mM DTT), 60 pmol of oligo-dT15, 40 U RNase inhibitor, and 200 U of M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega). The reaction was carried out at 42&#176;C for 1 h. The single stranded cDNA was diluted 10 times and 10 &#956;l of it was amplified by PCR. The PCR reaction was carried out in a 50-&#956;l mixture containing reaction buffer, 0.2 mM dNTP, 0.2 &#956;M of forward primer and reverse primer for c-src, and 2.5 U of Taq polymerase by GeneAmp PCR System 2400 (Applied Biosystems). As an internal standard, a pair of primers for &#946;-actin was included at the same time. Unless otherwise indicated, the following program is for c-src PCR reaction: the cDNA was denatured for 5 min at 94&#176;C and amplified for 30 cycles under the following conditions: 94&#176;C, 30 sec; 60&#176;C, 40 sec; and 72&#176;C, 1 min, followed by a 5-min elongation step at 72&#176;C. Sequences of primer pairs used were as follows:\nsrc:\nforward, 5&#8217;-CGCTGGCCGGTGGAGTGAC-3&#8217;;Reverse, 5&#8217;-CCAGCTTGCGGATCTTGTAGTGC-3&#8217;;\n&#946;-actin:\nforward: 5&#8217;-ATCATGTTTGAGACCTTCAA-3&#8217;;Reverse: 5&#8217;-CATCTCCTGCTCG AAGTCTA-3&#8217;.PCR products were resolved in a 1% agarose gel and detected by ethidium bormide staining.\n2.4. Statistical analysis\nValues given represent the mean &#177; SD of experiments done in triplicate. Statistical significance was tested by Student&#8217;s t-test for either paired or unpaired data as appropriate.\n3. Results\n\n3.1. Enhanced cellular proliferation and protein tyrosyl phosphorylation in LPS-treated Caco-2 cells\nGiven that colon contains large numbers of Gram-negative bacteria and colonic epithelial cells in situ are continuously exposed to LPS, therefore, the influence of LPS on cellular growth in human colon cancer cells, Caco-2, was analyzed. As shown in Figure 1, compared to non-treated controls, cells exposed to LPS (10 &#956;g/ml) exhibited significant mitogenesis (Figure 1). Thus, these results indicate that LPS can stimulate proliferation in Caco-2 cells. Because tyrosyl phosphorylation plays a critical role in mitogenesis, and to confirm that LPS can augment protein tyrosyl phosphorylation in colon epithelial cells, Caco-2 cells were stimulated with LPS for various time points. As demonstrated in Figure 2, a remarkable time-dependent increase of protein tyrosyl phosphorylation was detected. This finding suggested that LPS could upregulate the expression and/or catalytic activity of a protein tyrosine kinase in colon epithelial cells.\n3.2. Enhancement of both c-Src protein expression and c-src transcript in LPS-stimulated Caco-2 cells\nPreviously, we have reported the induction of c-Src in LPSexposed macrophages [11, 12]. To determine whether a similar event could also occur in colon epithelial cells, the expression of c-Src was checked in Caco-2 treated with or without LPS for various time points. As exhibited in Figure 3, compared to the constant expression of actin, a significant time-dependent upregulation of c-Src was observed. To further investigate the effect of LPS on the transcription of c-src, we performed the RT-PCR experiments to analyze the transcript abundance of c-src in Caco-2 cells stimulated with various concentrations of LPS for 96 h. As demonstrated in Figure 4, after normalization with actin transcript, the abundance of c-src was greatly increased in response to LPS. These results indicated that LPS could upregulate both the abundance of c-src transcript and the protein expression of c-Src in colon epithelial cells.\n3.3. Increased FAK autophosphorylation and ERK activation in Caco-2 cells exposed to LPS\nIt is well established that FAK is a substrate for c-Src whose kinase activity, reflected by its autophosphorylation (Pi-Y397 FAK), can be modulated by Src-mediated FAK phosphorylation at Y-576, -577 and 863. Since we have shown that LPS could induce c-Src expression, therefore we wanted to check its total enzymatic activity following LPS exposure. Because the level of Pi-Y397 FAK mirrors the activation of c-Src, thus we chose it as the indicator to assess c-Src kinase activity. Lysates prepared from Caco-2 cells treated with LPS for various time points were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western immunoblotted with antibodies against Pi-Y397 FAK and FAK respectively. As shown in Figure 5, while a similar amount of FAK was present in each sample, a remarkable time-dependent increase of FAK activity, measured by the level of Pi-Y397 FAK, was detected; indicating that accompanying the induction of c-Src in LPS-treated Caco-2 cells was the robust increase of its enzymatic activity.By virtue of c-Src activation, the Raf-MEK-ERK cascade is triggered. Since LPS treatment leads to the enhancement of c-Src expression as well as its total activity, we thereby addressed the point of whether LPS might increase ERK activation by determining the ERK activities in control and LPS-treated Caco-2 cells at various time points. Due to the fact that MEK-mediated ERK phosphorylation on residues Thr-202 and Tyr-204 increased the enzymatic activity of ERK, we therefore applied the monoclonal antibody specifically recognized these phosphorylated residues of ERK in Western immunoblotting. As shown in Figure 5, a significant time-dependent increase of phosphorylated ERK was detected in LPS-exposed Caco-2 cells as compared to the control when the expression of ERK in these cells was normalized.\n3.4. PP2 abolished LPS-mediated ERK activation and LPS-induced proliferation in Caco-2 cells\nMounting evidence reveals that ERK activation is critical for cell proliferation. The increased ERK activity accompanied with LPS-induced c-Src expression indicated that LPS could promote cellular growth via its induction of c-Src. To prove this hypothesis, LPS-elicited ERK activation and mitogenesis were determined in Caco-2 cells pretreated with or without PP2, the inhibitor for Src family members. Interestingly, PP2 not only abrogated LPS-increased ERK activation, but it also suppressed LPS-mediated cellular growth (Figure 6). These results can be taken as evidence to support the role of c-Src induction in LPSmediated Caco-2 proliferation.\n4. Discussion\nOur study proposes a pivotal role for LPS in promoting cellular growth via the induction of c-Src in a human colon carcinoma cell line (Caco-2). Accompanied with the enhancement of c-Src is its augmented activity, which provokes the activation of FAK and ERK. Remarkably, application of PP2 not only abrogates ERK activation, but it also inhibits cell proliferation in LPS-stimulated Caco-2 cells. Thus, the concomitant c-Src induction, ERK activation, and enhanced mitogenesis in colon epithelial cells in response to LPS offer a new perspective on the contribution of LPS to colon carcinoma progression.Induction of c-Src by LPS has previously been reported in macrophages [11, 12] that retain TLR4, the receptor for LPS. Here, a similar phenomenon is also observed in Caco-2, the colon epithelial cells. Though epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract were initially described to lack the expression of TLR4, current literature has provided evidence supporting its expression in a spectrum of intestinal colonocytes including Caco-2 [13, 14]. Thus, like macrophages, colon epithelial cells could also be considered as LPS-responsive. Indeed, LPS was reported to induce the proinflammatory cytokine IL-8 in HT29 and SW620 epithelial cells [15, 16] as well as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in human adenocarcinoma CE-1 cells [17].ERK appears to be an important signaling molecule in LPSinitiated activation of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). In contrast to its participation in LPS-induced heat shock protein 25 (HSP25) in young adult mouse colon (YAMC) cells [2], ERK activation mediated by c-Src induction renders LPS-exposed Caco-2 cells more mitogenic. It is noteworthy that in addition to ERK, LPSelicited proliferation can also be attributable to the generation of PGE2, which can act as an autocrine growth-stimulating factor [17]Aberrant expression of c-Src has been closely linked to initiation and progression of human CRC [18]. However, to date, no underlying mechanism has been proposed to elucidate the upregulation of c-Src in IEC. Given that IECs are continuously exposed to high concentrations of LPS in the colonic fluid, LPS-induced c-Src expression therefore provides an immediate explanation for c-Src upregulation in CRC. Based on our studies in both macrophages and epithelial cells, LPS-elicited c-Src expression seems to be a &#8220;universal phenomenon&#8221;. While overexpression of c-Src in colon epithelial cells may cause a catastrophe, chemicals that attenuate its expression may provide remedies. Indeed, sodium butyrate, the major fermentation product of dietary fiber, appears to be an ideal choice for this purpose. In a separate, recent study, we have demonstrated that by virtue of reducing c-src transcript as well as c-Src protein expression, butyrate could effectively arrest the growth of neoplasmic colonocytes [19].In summary, our demonstration of ERK activation accompanied with augmented c-Src expression plays an essential role in LPS-mediated proliferation in IECs. Notably, c-src was not among the LPS-responsive genes identified by microarrays [20, 21]. Considering the role of c-src in transformation and its LPSinducible characteristic, our findings might supplement and extend the current understanding of the mechanisms by which LPS exerts its effects in the development of human cancers.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank Dr. Sally Parsons for providing Src antibody (GD11).

Introduction\nThe Canadian 24-h movement guidelines for children and youth recommend that children 5&#8211;17 years of age accumulate a minimum of 60 min of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) per day to achieve health benefits [1]. Additionally, children should engage in vigorous activities as well as activities to strengthen muscles and bones three or more days per week. Nationally representative data reveal that approximately 7% of Canadian 5&#8211;11&#8211;year-old children meet daily MVPA guidelines [2,3]. However, when fewer days per week were examined, 40% and 80% of Canadian children achieved the recommended daily 60 min of MVPA at least three days and at least one day per week, respectively [4]. While these data illustrate that 60 min of MVPA in a single day is achievable for Canadian children, consistency continues to be problematic.Consistent engagement in MVPA has gained considerable attention in the physical activity and public health literature because of the health benefits associated with regular participation [4,5,6,7,8,9]. Regular physical activity has musculoskeletal and cardiovascular health benefits and assists with the maintenance of healthy body weight among children [4,8,10]. Furthermore, regular physical activity decreases the likelihood of becoming overweight or obese by as much as 70% [11] and engaging in MVPA (e.g., brisk walking) has been linked to reductions in blood pressure among children and youth [10]. In contrast, engagement in sedentary activities (e.g., television watching) significantly increases the likelihood of becoming overweight or obese by as much as 61% [11] and has been positively correlated with being at risk of metabolic syndrome and hypertension [12,13,14].To date, evidence of age-related trends in physical activity participation during childhood has consisted of both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. Cross-sectional studies have shown that the physical activity levels of younger children (3&#8211;5 years of age) are higher than children in middle/late childhood and adolescence, and levels of sedentary behaviour are lower [15,16,17,18,19]. Similarly, longitudinal studies [20,21,22,23], as well as a systematic review [24] examining physical activity and sedentary behaviour over time, highlight a decline in physical activity and increase in sedentary behaviour with age.In Canada, cross-sectional findings show 14% of 5-year-olds [3] and 9% and 4% of 6&#8211;10-year-old boys and girls [2] accumulated the minimum 60 min of MVPA. These two studies also revealed that 5-year-old children spent less time engaged in sedentary behaviour when compared to children 6&#8211;10 years of age. The trend toward lower levels of physical activity with increasing age is also apparent from middle childhood, to adolescence, to adulthood. For example, cross-sectional findings from Troiano and colleagues [25] found that 42% of children aged 6&#8211;11 years accumulated the recommended amount of at least one hour of physical activity per day, whereas only 8% of adolescents and 5% of young adults met the guideline [25].Jones and colleagues&#8217; [24] systematic review highlights the variability in tracking coefficients found across early and middle childhood. They report that 83% of studies found moderate or better levels of sedentary behaviour tracking compared to the 64% that reported moderate or better levels of tracking for total physical activity [24]. The inconsistencies in the level of tracking reported for physical activity and sedentary behaviour may be related to the methods and tools used to collect these data. For example, modest levels of tracking were reported using accelerometers in early childhood [22] compared to Pate et al. [26] who found physical activity to track reasonably well using the PAHR-50 index (activity > 50% of resting heart rate). For middle childhood, Janz et al. [21] found moderate levels of tracking for physical activity and sedentary behaviour in comparison to modest levels of tracking for physical activity with pedometers. The discrepancies among tools used to collect both physical activity and sedentary data may have an influence on the levels of tracking when comparing results between studies.Few studies have concurrently examined both physical activity and sedentary behaviours of children longitudinally. Perhaps this is because of some of the difficulties associated with longitudinal research, mainly drop out or failure to meet inclusion criteria. Jones and colleagues [24] identified only two studies (out of fourteen) that reported both physical activity and sedentary behaviour tracking coefficients [21,22]. Janz and colleagues [21] had the lone study that tracked both physical and sedentary behaviour among school-aged children over three years (from 5 to 8 years of age). At follow-up, Spearman rank-order correlation coefficients revealed that the children&#8217;s sedentary behaviour tracked more consistently (r = 0.37&#8211;0.52) than total activity (r = 0.18&#8211;0.39). It has been more than a decade since Janz and colleagues collected their data using 60-s epoch lengths and three metabolic equivalent (3 MET) cut-points for MVPA. More recently, the consensus is that when measuring physical activity among children using accelerometry, researchers should use shorter epoch lengths and a 4 MET cut-point for MVPA [27,28].How MVPA is classified is a major methodological issue. Using a threshold count that is too low may overestimate the amount of time spent in MVPA [28,29]. The cut-off for MVPA typically used with adults is 3 METs [30], however, several studies with children have shown that brisk walking, which is a form of moderate-intensity activity, requires an energy expenditure of 4 METs [28,31]. A secondary methodological issue is epoch length. An epoch is a filtered digitized acceleration signal over a user-specified time interval, which sums counts of movement, which is typically in counts per minute (1-min epochs) [28,31]. However, researchers have concluded that unlike adults, children&#8217;s physical activity patterns are usually sporadic and intermittent in duration, typically lasting several seconds; as such, researchers have suggested that using 1-min epochs may result in an underestimation of participation in MVPA [28,32]. Therefore, measuring MVPA at 4 METs and using 15-s epoch lengths are more likely to yield more accurate results.The present study extends the work of Janz and colleagues [21] by using cut-points (specifically, 4 METs for MVPA) and sampling rates (15-s epochs) that should produce a more accurate estimate of children&#8217;s physical activity. Additionally, reporting MVPA calculated at 3 METs allows for comparison with previously published studies where 3 METs were used as a cut-point, and measuring both physical activity and sedentary behaviour provides a more complete picture of how children spend the majority of their day. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the levels of physical activity and sedentary behaviours sequentially from kindergarten to grade 2 cross-sectionally and in a small sub-cohort longitudinally. Specifically, we hypothesized that: (1) children&#8217;s MVPA and total physical activity levels would be higher in kindergarten compared to grade 2, and (2) sedentary behaviour would be lower in kindergarten compared to grade 2. To contribute methodologically to the literature, we also examined whether the differences between MVPA measured at 3 METs and 4 METs would be meaningful and whether the findings from the cross-sectional sample would be different to those collected in the longitudinal sample.\n2. Materials and Methods\nThe University of Victoria Human Research Ethics Board and the school district granted approval for this study. Data were collected in sequence over a period of four school years from 2010 to 2014 and included a cross-sectional and a longitudinal sample. The University ethics protocol number is 10-246, and the original ethics approval date was 23 June 2010. As per Canadian federal regulations, our ethics protocol was renewed in each school year.\n2.1. Participants\nChildren were eligible to participate if they were attending one of eight consenting schools from one school district in the province of British Columbia, Canada, and if their parent(s)/guardian(s) provided informed consent to the study. In this school district, results of provincial screening using the Early Development Index, a measure estimating school readiness in kindergarten, demonstrated that rates of Physical Health and Well Being, Social Competence, Emotional Maturity, Language and Cognitive Development, and Communication Skills, were higher than or equivalent to provincial rates [33].The first kindergarten cohort (wave one) was collected during the 2010&#8211;2011 school year and the second cohort of kindergarten children (wave two) during the 2011&#8211;2012 school year. In grade 2, data on cohort one participants were collected during the 2012&#8211;2013 school year and during the 2013&#8211;2014 school year for cohort two. Of the 206 children that consented to participate in kindergarten, 96 (Mean age = 5 years 7 months, 58% boys, Mean Body Mass Index (BMI) = 15.5 &#177; 1.8) met the accelerometer wear time criteria of 10 h of recorded physical activity and sedentary behaviour on at least three weekdays and one weekend day. In grade 2, 94 participants (Mean age = 7 years 9 months, 52% boys, Mean BMI = 15.8 &#177; 2.1) met the accelerometer inclusion criteria of the 185 recruited. Twenty-one of those children (49.6% boys) had valid physical activity and sedentary behaviour data for both kindergarten and grade 2 and comprised the longitudinal sample. The comparative cross-sectional sample was therefore 75 (96 &#8722; 21) in kindergarten and 73 (94 &#8722; 21) in grade 2. The total sample was n = 190 individuals.\n2.2. Measures\nPhysical activity levels were measured using the Actigraph GT1M accelerometer (ActiGraph, LLC, Fort Walton Beach, FL, USA). This was worn around the waist and positioned above the iliac crest on the right hip and recorded both frequency and intensity of acceleration or movement. This uniaxial accelerometer collected pre-filtered data at a rate of 30 measurements per second (30 Hz), which was then post-filtered into epochs. In this study, 15-s epochs were used to record physical activity and then converted to a metabolic equivalent (MET). Fifteen-second epochs have been recommended in order to record the sporadic activity of younger children [34]. The Actigraph accelerometer has been shown to be a valid indicator of energy expenditure and activity levels in children and youth [35,36,37]. Average wear time for children included in the study in kindergarten was 12.0 h (Std Deviation = 0.8) and in grade 2 was 12.1 h (Std Deviation = 0.7). Sixteen percent of included children met the weekday wear-time criteria on three weekdays, 67% on four weekdays, and 17% on five weekdays; 50% of children met the weekend wear-time criteria on one weekend day and 50% on two weekend days.\n2.3. Procedures\nEach child was fitted with an accelerometer during school hours and an information package was sent home to the parents/guardians. Parents were asked to have their child wear the accelerometer from when the child rose in the morning until they went to bed, only to be removed when swimming or bathing. This procedure was the same in kindergarten and grade 2. Data were collected in the same season in kindergarten and grade 2 (ranging from fall to spring) for each school. For example, if accelerometry data were collected in the spring in kindergarten at a particular school, data were collected in spring in grade 2 at that school.The minimum valid wear time was 10 h per day for at least four days (including at least three weekdays and one weekend day) [38]. Based on comparable studies [28,39], the recorded physical activity and sedentary behaviour were classified by intensity into the following categories: MVPA as &#8805;4 METs and as &#8805;3 METs; total physical activity as &#8805;1.5 METs; and sedentary behaviour as <1.5 METs. MVPA was classified at both &#8805;3 METs and &#8805;4 METs because although &#8805;4 METs is a more accurate cut-point for MVPA in children [31,40], many studies have classified children&#8217;s MVPA at &#8805;3 METs [2,3,21,41]. Including &#8805;3 METs allowed for easier comparisons with the existing literature. Both light and MVPA were summed to represent total physical activity. In order to standardize the minutes of physical activity and sedentary behaviours accrued, activity minutes were adjusted to minutes per hour and all analyses used this measure.\n2.4. Data Treatment and Analyses\nRaw data from the accelerometers were downloaded using ActiLife software (Actigraph LLC) for subsequent data reduction. Kinesoft software (version 2.0.94, Kinesoft Software, Rothesay, NB, Canada) was used for analysis, extraction, and processing of the physical activity data. Kinesoft age-specific cut-points were used, specifically: in kindergarten, sedentary behaviour &#8804; 150 counts per minute, 3 METs &#8805; 614 counts per minute, and 4 METs &#8805; 1400 counts per minute. In grade 2, the age-specific cut-points were: sedentary behaviour &#8804; 185 counts per minute, 3 METs &#8805; 705 counts per minute, and 4 METs &#8805; 1515 counts per minute. Data analyses were performed using IBM SPSS (Version 23.0) for Windows [42]. Descriptive statistics were computed for average minutes of physical activity per day and minutes per hour at the following intensities: sedentary, MVPA, and total. Multiple independent t-tests were computed to examine any differences in physical activity and sedentary behaviour among the kindergarten and grade 2 samples as well as to determine whether there were any differences between the cross-sectional and longitudinal samples. Repeated measures analyses of variance (ANOVA) using grade level as the between-subject factor were used to examine the differences in physical activity and sedentary behaviour in the longitudinal sample.\n3. Results\n\n3.1. Cross-Sectional Physical Activity and Sedentary Behaviour\nTable 1 and Table 2 display the cross-sectional descriptive statistics for physical activity (MVPA and total physical activity) and sedentary behaviour in minutes per day and minutes per hour, respectively. Physical activity levels were generally high for children in both kindergarten and grade 2. Furthermore, in each grade, children accumulated more minutes in sedentary behaviours than either MVPA or total physical activity. For the entire cross-sectional sample of 148 participants, independent t-tests revealed that physical activity levels were significantly lower among the grade 2 students and sedentary behaviour was significantly higher. Specifically, MVPA t (141) = 6.881, p < 0.001) and total physical activity t (141) = 8.364, p < 0.001) was lower by grade 2, whereas sedentary behaviour was significantly higher in grade 2 t (141) = &#8722;9.313, p < 0.001). An independent samples t-test revealed there were no significant differences between the boys and girls in either kindergarten or grade 2.\n3.2. Longitudinal Physical Activity and Sedentary Behaviour\nTable 3 and Table 4 provide the descriptive statistics for physical activity (MVPA and total physical activity) and sedentary behaviour in minutes per day and per hour for the longitudinal sample. Overall, physical activity levels were high in both kindergarten and grade 2 but declined over time. Sedentary behaviour accounted for more minutes than total physical activity and increased by grade 2.Repeated measures ANOVA revealed significant differences in both physical activity levels and sedentary behaviour over time in the longitudinal sample (n = 21). Specifically, Wilks&#8217; lambda (&#955;) = 0.21, F (1,20) = 74.21, p < 0.001 for sedentary behaviour, &#955; = 0.36, F (1,20) = 34.88, p < 0.001 for MVPA, and &#955; = 0.35, F (1,20) = 35.72, p < 0.001 for total activity show that sedentary behaviour increased significantly while both MVPA and total physical activity decreased from kindergarten to grade 2. Pearson product-moment correlations revealed that sedentary behaviour in kindergarten was significantly correlated (r = 0.56, p < 0.01) with sedentary behaviour in grade 2. Both MVPA (r = 0.23, p < 0.05) and total physical activity (r = 0.32, p < 0.05) tracked from kindergarten to grade 2. The intra-class correlation coefficients comparing kindergarten and grade 2 min were: 0.59 for total physical, 0.30 for MVPA, and 0.77 for sedentary behaviour.\n3.3. Differences between the Cross-Sectional Sample and Longitudinal Sample\nIndependent t-tests revealed that there were no significant differences between the cross-sectional sample and longitudinal sample in either kindergarten or grade 2. In kindergarten, we found no significant differences for MVPA t (94) = 0.743, p = 0.254, total physical activity t (94) = 0.950, p = 0.315, and sedentary behaviour t (94) = 0.818, p = &#8722;0.831. Similarly, we found no significant differences between the grade 2 samples for MVPA t (94) = 0.011, p = 0.729, total physical activity t (92) = 0.061, p = 0.938, or sedentary behaviour t (92) = &#8722;0.811, p = 0.347.\n4. Discussion\nWe set out to examine differences in physical activity levels and sedentary behaviour from kindergarten to grade 2. Our findings highlight the decline in physical activity minutes and increase in sedentary behaviours cross-sectionally and with a longitudinal sub-cohort. Our findings contribute to a growing body of evidence surrounding the issues of PA and sedentary behaviour, and our study is one of only a few studies to explore these factors over time, which is discussed further throughout the discussion.\n4.1. Physical Activity and Sedentary Behaviour\nOverall, the physical activity levels of children in kindergarten and grade 2 were high. Kindergarten and grade 2 children accumulated an average of 133 and 101 min of MVPA at 4 METs per day, respectively. The average number of minutes per day spent in MVPA was similar for the longitudinal sample (137 and 96 min of MVPA per day in kindergarten and grade 2, respectively). Fifty-nine percent of the cross-sectional sample in kindergarten and 57% in grade 2 children met the Canadian 24-h movement guidelines. A slightly higher proportion of the longitudinal sample met the same guideline (63% in kindergarten and 60% in grade 2). Our daily MVPA levels were far higher than those found in studies of 3&#8211;5-year-old Scottish and Australian children, where time spent in MVPA ranged between 3% and 13% (approximately 23 min per day) [43,44,45]. Furthermore, MVPA levels in this study were almost twice those reported by Colley et al. [2] for Canadian 5-year-olds but similar in grade 2 to those in grade 4 reported by Nettlefold et al. [41]. The differences between our study and the national sample reflect where the data were collected. Similar to Nettlefold and colleagues [41], this study was conducted in British Columbia, Canada. In comparison to the majority of Canadian provinces, British Columbia has more sunshine and less snow during the year [43,46]. These environmental affordances may in part explain why the province has some of the lowest rates of obesity among the Canadian provinces and why MVPA levels are typically 10% higher than the national average [46,47]. Future research comparing year-round activity levels may provide valuable information about seasonal variation in physical activity and sedentary behaviour levels among children in Canada.Notwithstanding the potential influence of weather on physical activity, our findings are similar to those of Janz and colleagues&#8217; [21] tracking study that spanned 3 years (children 5&#8211;8 years of age). We found that MVPA declined from 22% to 16%, while the Janz et al. participants&#8217; levels declined from 26% to 17%. These dramatic reductions in MVPA across the primary years were also evident in cross-sectional data from both Canada and the United States [3,25].Sedentary behaviour minutes in our study were high. Specifically, children in kindergarten and grade 2 spent approximately 367 min and 439 min (60% and 72% of the day) engaged in sedentary behaviours, respectively. Similarly, the smaller longitudinal sample of children accrued approximately 366 min in kindergarten and 435 min in grade 2. In the present study, kindergarten children (cross-sectional and longitudinal) spent less time in sedentary behaviour in comparison to other Canadian 5-year-olds, whose daily average of sedentary behaviour was 381 min [2]. For older children, however, the 439 and 435 min of sedentary behaviour reported for the cross-sectional and longitudinal samples were similar [3]. Other studies examining Canadian children&#8217;s sedentary behaviour using accelerometers and identical cut-points differed from the findings of this study. Herman and colleagues [48] found much lower levels of sedentary behaviour (~360 min) among 8&#8211;10-year-old normal weight and overweight boys and girls. However, the authors indicated that these findings may not have been generalizable to the rest of Canada, without explaining their reasoning. Much higher levels of sedentary behaviour (539 min) have previously been found in somewhat older children in British Columbia [41]. It is possible that the higher rates of sedentary behaviour demonstrated by Nettlefold et al. are indicative of the age-related (8&#8211;11 years old versus 7 years old) increase in sedentary behaviour during childhood [2,3]. While there is no definitive reason why sedentary behaviour increases, perhaps school-time demands for sitting and recreational screen-time are greater in grade 2 than in kindergarten.With each passing school year, there is an increase in workload, homework, and school-time sitting [23]. Efforts have been made to break up the amount of time in school children are sitting down. These efforts include standing desks [49] and physical activity breaks [50]. Outside of the school environment, watching television and other forms of screen-time have been directly linked to sedentary behaviour for children [4,48,51]. Strasburger [51] suggests that older children and adolescents spend more than 7 h per day engaged in various forms of screen-time and emphasized the amount of access youth have to sedentary pursuits. For example, in the United States it is estimated that 93% of youth aged 12&#8211;17 years have Internet access and over 70% have a cell phone. These studies illustrate the variety of factors contributing to sedentary behaviours among children and youth.We used accelerometry to measure both physical activity and sedentary behaviour. While an effective measurement tool, there continues to be issues surrounding the classification of MVPA. Specifically, using cut-points that are too low may result in an overestimation of the amount of time spent in MVPA [28,29,37]. Research measuring physical activity intensity among children comparing both 3 MET and 4 MET values [31,37] revealed that using a more conservative approach to measuring MVPA (4 METs) yielded more accurate results for children [37]. We measured MVPA with both 3 METs and 4 METs to address this issue and enhance generalizability and the approach yielded differences in minutes accrued. In addition, as the Actigraph accelerometers that we used in this study do not assess the posture adopted when an individual is sedentary, we do not know what positions the children were adopting (e.g., standing, sitting, or lying) when they were sedentary, or whether they were using their upper body without moving their trunk. This potentially overestimates the level of sedentary behaviour; however, as the same protocol was adopted in kindergarten and in grade 2, the change in sedentary behaviour levels is unlikely to be an artifact but a real change in behaviour.Our results showed an increase in physical activity levels by more than 30 min when using the 3 MET cut-point versus the 4 MET cut-point. These differences, when equated to minutes, can make a meaningful difference in classifying someone as achieving the health-related guidelines. Classification accuracy (e.g., meeting guidelines or not) has been shown to be influenced by the type of accelerometer used and how cut-points were developed [28]. Moving forward, it is important for consensus around classifying intensity among children, but until then, future research should classify moderate activity using both 3 MET and 4 MET cut-points.We found that physical activity decreased while sedentary behaviour increased from kindergarten to grade 2. Among the longitudinal sample, this significant decrease equalled approximately 42 min of MVPA. Total physical activity decreased by more than 70 min while sedentary behaviour increased by almost 70 min in both the cross-sectional and longitudinal samples. These findings are consistent with previous research showing that physical activity significantly declines over time while sedentary behaviours increase [25,52]. It is clear from our kindergarten data that the capacity for higher levels of physical activity and lower levels of sedentary behaviour exists; however, we do not know why these dramatic changes occurred. Examining pressures during school and out-of-school time that may contribute to these changes is a next step in ameliorating these negative trends.\n4.2. Limitations\nThis study is not without limitations. Perhaps the most significant was the rate of attrition in the longitudinal sample. Participants were excluded from the study if they did not have at least 10 hours of wear time for at least three weekdays and one weekend day. This resulted in a loss of 51% of the recruited participants from analysis. Further loss from the cross-sectional sample to the longitudinal cohort was due to factors such as: enrolment in a different school, consent obtained in kindergarten but not in grade 2 (or vice versa), or lack of wear time due to the belt not being comfortable. Despite this, the longitudinal sample results did not differ significantly from those derived from the larger cross-sectional sample and thus we believe that these findings are representative of our larger cross-sectional sample. This provides important information not only about the generalizability of the findings but also adds to the literature from a methodological standpoint. Although the sample was not sufficiently large to stratify these results by school (i.e., n = 8 schools), preliminary analyses revealed that school did not interact significantly with physical activity levels or sedentary behaviour.\n5. Conclusions\nOur findings suggest high levels of both MVPA and sedentary time among British Columbian children and that MVPA consistently declines while sedentary time increases from kindergarten to grade 2. It appears that there is a critical need to invest in strategies to maintain higher levels of physical activity across the primary years and reduce sedentary time, since these behaviours are associated with both positive and negative health outcomes, respectively. In addition, until consensus is reached, public health researchers should use both the 3 MET and 4 MET cut-points for MVPA in order to allow for more robust estimates and cross-study comparability.", "pmid": "30241367", "title": "The Physical Activity and Sedentary Behaviour Patterns of Children in Kindergarten and Grade 2", "journal_title": "Children", "authors": "Jeff R.

However, the results have been contradictory with respect to whether cholesterol levels increase or decrease in HD models. Biochemical and mass spectrometry methods show reduced levels of cholesterol precursors and cholesterol in HD cells and in the brains of several HD animal models. Abnormal brain cholesterol homeostasis was also inferred from studies in HD patients. In contrast, colorimetric and enzymatic methods indicate cholesterol accumulation in HD cells and tissues. Here we used several methods to investigate cholesterol levels in cultured cells in the presence or absence of mutant HTT protein.\nResults\nColorimetric and enzymatic methods with low sensitivity gave variable results, whereas results from a sensitive analytical method, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, were more reliable.

Care must be taken to prepare the sample appropriately. By evaluating lathosterol levels using isotopic dilution mass spectrometry, we confirmed reduced cholesterol biosynthesis in knock-in cells expressing the polyQ mutation in a constitutive or inducible manner.\n*Correspondence should be addressed to Elena Cattaneo: elena.cattaneo@unimi.it", "body": "Introduction\nHuntington&#8217;s disease (HD) is an adult-onset neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expansion in the CAG repeat in the 5&#8217; terminus of the HD gene 1. In the Huntingtin protein (HTT), which is a ubiquitously expressed protein with beneficial roles in brain neurons, the CAG repeat is translated into a polyglutamine (polyQ) tract 2. HD pathology involves multi-faceted mechanisms that affect nearly all aspects of cellular physiology 2. Among these mechanisms, abnormalities in cholesterol metabolism have been reported in HD cellular and animal models and in tissues from HD patients 3, \n4. In particular, mRNA levels of key genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis are reported to be reduced in clonal striatal-derived cells that overexpress mutant HTT (muHTT) 5 as well as in brain samples from HD mice and in post-mortem HD cerebral specimens 6. Biochemical and mass spectrometry analyses confirmed reduced levels of cholesterol precursors early in the disease process in brains from R6/2, YAC46, YAC72 and YAC128 knock-in mice and transgenic rats. At later time points, the same animals showed decreased levels of sterols/cholesterol 6, \n7, \n8. Brain cholesterol homeostasis is also affected in humans in the early stages of the disease 9, \n10. One possible mechanism that could explain this is a reduction in the nuclear translocation of SREBP, a master transcriptional activator of several cholesterogenic genes 6. A recent report confirmed a reduced cholesterol level in neural stem (NS) cell lines developed from embryonic brains of wild-type and knock-in HD mice expressing full-length endogenous normal HTT (Hdh7/7Q) or muHTT (Hdh140/140Q) but not in NS cell lines derived from embryonic stem cells of heterozygous knock-in HD mice (Hdh140/7Q) 11. In contrast, other groups reported cholesterol accumulation, not cholesterol reduction, in mouse and human HD tissues and cell cultures 12, \n13, \n14. In particular, it was reported that muHTT could interact with caveolin-1 and cause an accumulation of intracellular cholesterol in primary neurons and in brains from the YAC72 transgenic mouse model of HD 12. Further, primary rat neurons that overexpress muHTT fragments showed sterol accumulation, and SIRT2 inhibition reduced sterol levels via decreased nuclear trafficking of SREBP2 13. Lastly, muHTT expression resulted in the accumulation of cholesterol in HD cellular and murine models and in HD-affected human brains, and its altered cellular distribution contributed to NMDA-mediated excitotoxicity 14.These conflicting data, which might be the result of the use of different techniques and experimental materials in the different studies, raise the questions of whether cholesterol levels increase or decrease in HD and how this affects cellular and brain dysfunction in the disease. A tentative unifying hypothesis suggests that decreased cholesterol biosynthesis in HD may be the consequence of sterol accumulation 4, but further clarification regarding cholesterol level changes in HD is needed.In this study, we used several methods to measure sterols and cholesterol levels in immortalized knock-in cells derived from the embryonic striatum of mice carrying the endogenous HTT gene with 7Q (ST Kin7/7Q) or 109Q inserted into the mouse locus (ST Kin109/109Q). We found different results depending on the technique adopted and that definitive methodology, such as gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), should be favoured. Changes in cholesterol levels have been linked to NMDA receptor activity 14, but we could not detect this receptor when analysing the same cells used in the earlier study. Our data also reveal that sample preparation, degree of confluence and clonal properties strongly influence the results and, in particular, the level of intracellular cholesterol that is detected. A further confounding factor may stem from changes in the properties or technical issues related to the distribution and/or culture of target cell lines carrying the HD gene.\nResults and discussion\n\nComparison of different methods that measure sterol content \nA number of methods are available for measuring lipid and cholesterol content in cells. Among the commercially available kits, the enzymatic method, which is based on cholesterol esterase and oxidase, has been used to measure cholesterol in HD samples 6, \n13, \n14. This method is not specific for cholesterol but all sterols can be measured since the &#946;-OH group involved in the enzymatic reaction mediated by cholesterol oxidase is common to many sterols. To quantify the extent of this possible confounding effect, we loaded ST Kin7/7Q cells with increasing concentrations of exogenous cholesterol and then subjected the cellular preparations to lipid detection by the enzymatic method.Specifically, ST Kin7/7Q cells were cultured in normal growth medium and incubated with increasing concentrations of cholesterol (0, 5, 15, 30, 50 and 80 &#181;g/ml) for 16 hours (Fig. 1). Lipids were then purified by solvent-based extraction and measured with the Amplex&#174; Red Enzyme Assay (Invitrogen). Figure 1b shows that the enzymatic method detected the accumulation of exogenous cholesterol in ST Kin7/7Q cells loaded with 5 &#181;g/ml and 15 &#181;g/ml cholesterol, while linearity was lost at 30 &#181;g/ml. Higher doses of cholesterol were toxic, as evident in the phase contrast pictures of cultured cells treated with 50 &#181;g/ml and 80 &#181;g/ml cholesterol (Fig. 1a).These findings confirmed that the enzymatic method could reliably detect accumulation of exogenously supplied cholesterol in cultured cells (up to 15 &#181;g/ml). In addition, the enzymatic detection may give misleading results when measuring subtle changes in endogenous cholesterol levels as this assay reflects the total sterol rather than the total cholesterol content, as noted previously 15.Colorimetric methods (filipin staining and Nile Red staining) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) have also been used to detect cholesterol levels. The colorimetric methods are based on fluorescent molecules that bind to lipids and sterols with high affinity, while GC-MS is an analytical method that allows detection of cholesterol after its chromatographic separation from other sterols and by isotope dilution with deuterium labelled internal standard. To compare the analytical sensibility of these methods, we performed cholesterol loading or depletion of ST Kin7/7Q cells and then measured the cholesterol content using both methods.In the first set of experiments, ST Kin7/7Q cells were incubated with 0 (vehicle), 3, 5, 7 and 10 &#181;g/ml of cholesterol for 16 hours and then analysed by filipin staining or GC-MS. As shown in Figure 1c, visual inspection of the stained cultures revealed a difference in the filipin staining of cells cultured with 10 &#181;g/ml of cholesterol compared to control, but we could not detect any differences in cultures treated with <7 &#181;g/ml cholesterol (Fig. 1c; Suppl. Fig. 1a). Notably, the fluorescence intensity varied from field to field for the 10 &#181;g/ml culture, leading to a large SD (Suppl. Fig. 1a). GC-MS analysis showed a gradual dose-dependent increase of cholesterol content in ST Kin7/7Q cells (Fig. 1d).Next we exposed cultures of ST Kin7/7Q cells to increasing concentrations of methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (M&#946;CD; 0, 1, 5, 10 and 25 mM) for 1 hour in order to deplete cells of cholesterol. The cholesterol content was then measured by filipin staining or by GC-MS. Figure 1e and 1f show that the cholesterol depletion was detectable by both methods. However, GC-MS was more sensible compared to filipin staining. Specifically, when cells were treated with 1 mM M&#946;CD, the decrease in cholesterol content was detectable by GC-MS but not by filipin staining. We concluded that GC-MS, but not filipin staining, could detect increased cholesterol levels in vitro on the order of a few &#181;g/ml. In addition, filipin staining resulted in variable fluorescence within the same sample. GC-MS was also more sensible for detecting decreased cholesterol levels in vitro, because GC-MS, but not filipin staining, detected a decrease in cholesterol after acute treatment with >1 mM M&#946;CD. The higher M&#946;CD doses decreased cell survival. We concluded that although filipin can detect free cholesterol, it is not quantitative and may be more suitable for detection of cholesterol in situ. In contrast, GC-MS is reliable when appropriate standards are used.\nCholesterol levels in ST Kin7/7Q cells loaded with or depleted of cholesterol.\na) Phase contrast images of ST Kin7/7Q cells loaded with increasing concentrations of cholesterol (5, 15, 30, 50 and 80 &#181;g/ml) show that high concentrations of cholesterol (50&#8211;80 &#181;g/ml) are toxic to the cells and lead to dramatic morphological changes. 10X magnification. b) Cholesterol levels, as measured by enzymatic method a, in the same ST Kin7/7Q cells shown in (a), show that cholesterol accumulation is detected in ST-Kin7/7Q cells loaded with 5 and 15 &#181;g/ml cholesterol, while linearity is lost at 30 &#181;g/ml. In the cells loaded with the highest amounts of cholesterol, i.e. 50 and 80 &#181;g/ml, we could not measure cholesterol accumulation because these doses led to cell death, as shown in the phase contrast images. c-d) Comparison of cholesterol quantification using filipin staining (c) and GC-MS (d) in ST Kin7/7Q cells loaded with increasing concentrations of cholesterol (3, 5, 7 and 10 &#181;g/ml) suggests that filipin staining is less sensitive than GC-MS. The images shown were cropped from 20X magnification images. e-f) Comparison of filipin staining (e) and GC-MS (f) quantification of cholesterol in ST Kin7/7Q cells depleted of cholesterol by exposing them to increasing concentrations of M&#946;CD (1, 5, 10 and 25 mM). The images shown were cropped from 20X magnification images. Cells were plated at the same densities in 6-well plates for cholesterol detection by the enzymatic method and by GC-MS and in 12-well plates for filipin staining. Two independent experiments were performed in which the cells were processed in parallel for filipin staining and for cholesterol quantification by GC-MS. The graphs (d, f) represent the mean &#177; SEM as determined from the analysis of two independent experiments in which each sample was processed in duplicate. Statistics: One-way ANOVA and the Newman-Keuls Multiple Comparison Test were performed. Significant differences are indicated by asterisks: *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001).\n\nSterol content in striatal immortalized knock-in cells expressing muHTT\nTo investigate the consistency of colorimetric staining, enzymatic methods and GC-MS for detecting sterol changes in HD cell models, we evaluated intracellular lipid and cholesterol levels in ST Kin7/7Q cells and in ST Kin cells expressing muHTT with 109Q (ST Kin109/109Q) 16. We first used Nile Red, a vital lipophilic dye that is used to label neutral lipids (i.e. triacylglycerols or cholesteryl esters) 17, to detect the accumulation of intracellular lipid droplets in ST Kin7/7Q cells and in two ST Kin109/109Q cell clones (clone #2 and clone #6). As shown in Figure 2a, low-magnification fluorescent images did not show differences in lipid accumulation between wild-type and mutant cells. Notably, the staining was heterogeneous within each cell line; thus, high-magnification fluorescent analysis of a few cells or single cells was avoided, as this would lead to misleading results.In addition to Nile Red, we also tried filipin staining. We did not find any significant differences between the staining of ST Kin7/7Q cells and the staining of ST Kin109/109Q clones #2 or #6 (Fig. 2a). Filipin staining was heterogeneous in that some cells showed a punctuate signal and some cells showed more diffuse staining. In addition, there was high variability in the fluorescent intensity in different fields of the same well (Suppl. Fig. 1b). This variability was more evident within the different clones compared to in experiments in which cholesterol was added or removed (Fig. 1c, e). Of note, we found that filipin exhibited rapid photo-bleaching and only modest natural fluorescence under UV excitation, which introduces another confounding factor in the detection of cholesterol using this method.These results using two qualitative colorimetric methods, i.e. Nile Red and filipin staining, indicated that the levels of neutral lipids and free cholesterol were similar in wild-type and muHTT cell lines, conflicting with the results reported by other researchers that have used the same cell lines 14. Indeed, in the study by Del Toro et al. (2010), the authors detected increased Nile Red and filipin staining, as well as cholesterol accumulation as detected by the enzymatic method, in a clone of ST Kin109/109Q cells compared to ST Kin7/7Q cells 14.We are aware that filipin staining cannot be considered a quantitative method for measuring sterol/cholesterol content in cells or tissues, so we rechecked the levels of intracellular sterols in ST Kin7/7Q cells and ST Kin109/109Q cells by the enzymatic method used by Del Toro et al. (2010) 14 and in our previous study 6. Notably, different protocols for the preparation of the samples were used in the two studies. The protocol used by Del Toro et al. (2010) 14 was based on a protein lysate preparation followed by cholesterol esterase and oxidase incubation (method a). In Valenza et al. (2005) 6, a solvent-based extraction was used to obtain a lipid fraction from the cells (method b).In agreement with the filipin staining results shown in Figure 2a, the sterol content as measured by method a was the same in ST Kin7/7Q and in one clone of ST Kin109/109Q cells (clone #2, Fig. 2B) but was increased in the second ST Kin109/109Q cell clone (clone #6). Because sterols are lipids, it is better to measure sterols in a cellular lipid extract rather than in a cellular protein extract. To evaluate whether the preparation of the sample influenced cholesterol/sterol detection, we also measured sterol levels after lipid extraction from the same samples (method b; Fig. 2). As shown in Figure 2c, method b, but not method a, detected similar sterol levels in ST Kin7/7Q cells and in the two ST Kin109/109Q cell clones (Fig. 2B). In Del Toro et al. (2010), the finding of an increased level of cholesterol at the plasma membrane was linked to increased sensitivity of the muHTT cells to NMDA-mediated excitotoxicity 14. However, we failed to detect the activity of NMDA or AMPA receptors, as judged by Ca2+ efflux (Suppl. Fig. 2a, b) and by a lack of change in the expression of the NMDA 2B, GLUR1 and GLUR5 genes by qualitative PCR (data not shown) in ST Kin7/7Q cells. Moreover, we also failed to detect the expression of the NMDA subunit NR1, as judged by real time qPCR, in ST Kin7/7Q and ST Kin109/109Q cells (Fig. 2S c).To further verify the level of cholesterol in ST Kin7/7Q and ST Kin109/109Q cells, we analysed our cellular preparations by isotope dilution GC-MS. The data in Figure 2d confirmed the results obtained using the enzymatic method on lipid extracts (method b) and previous data from an immortalized striatal cell line with inducible expression of the N-terminal fragment of muHTT 6. Specifically, we detected no changes in cholesterol levels in this cell system growing in serum-containing medium.Taken together, these findings suggest that differences in sample preparation methods, such as the use of lipid vs. protein extracts, can lead to differences in the detection of changes in cholesterol levels. This may account for the inconsistent results from different laboratories when different methods are used. Our results also highlighted the importance of measuring cholesterol in cells and tissues with the most appropriate method; specifically, GC-MS appears to be the most sensitive and reliable method. In agreement with this finding, all results obtained by GC-MS in different studies show decreases in cholesterol levels in HD cells and tissues 7, \n8, \n11. Finally, although outside the scope of the present study, our inability to detect the NMDA-AMPA receptor in ST Kin cell lines made it almost impossible to study the possible link between cholesterol changes and increased sensitivity to NMDA-mediated excitotoxicity of these muHTT cells, as proposed previously 14.\nNeutral lipids and sterols in ST Kin 7/7Q and in ST Kin109/109Q cells. a) Staining with Nile Red, a marker of neutral lipids, does not show any differences between wild-type cells (ST Kin7/7Q) and HD cells (ST Kin109/109Q, clone #2 and clone #6). Similarly, filipin staining does not show any differences between the cell lines. 20X magnification. b-d) Comparison of two enzymatic methods and GC-MS for measuring cholesterol levels in ST Kin7/7Q and ST K-in109/109Q cell lines. The two methods differ in the sample preparation method that is used prior to cholesterol detection. The cells were processed to obtain either a protein lysate, as described in Del Toro 2010 (method a), or a lipid extract, as described in Valenza et al. 2005 (method b), and both preparations were subjected to cholesterol esterase and oxidase assay. Using enzymatic method a, an increase in sterol levels was detected in ST Kin109/109Q clone #6 compared to wild-type ST Kin7/7Q cells, while similar levels of sterols were found in ST Kin109/109Q clone #2 and ST Kin7/7Q cells (b). Sterol quantification by method b does not reveal any differences in sterol content in ST Kin7/7Q versus ST Kin109/109Q clonal cells (c). Similarly, GC-MS showed no differences between the wild-type and HD cell lines (d). Each sample was analysed in duplicate, and the graphs show the mean &#177; SEM of three independent experiments. Statistics: One-way ANOVA and the Newman-Keuls Multiple Comparison Test were performed. Significant differences are represented by asterisks: *p < 0.05.\n\nLevels of cholesterol precursors in ST Kin cells that express muHTT\nTo verify the decrease of the cholesterol levels in the HD cells used in this study, we used isotope dilution GC-MS to measure cholesterol precursors, including lanosterol, lathosterol, desmosterol and 7-dehydroxycholesterol (7DHC). Cells were collected when they reached 80&#8211;90% confluence. Figure 3 shows that the levels of lanosterol and lathosterol in both ST kin109/109Q clones were unchanged compared to control cells, while the levels of desmosterol and 7DHC were significantly decreased in both ST Kin109/109Q clones compared to control cells (Fig. 3 c-d). These results indicate a reduction in the availability of some, but not all, cholesterol precursors in these HD cells.Cholesterol homeostasis in vitro might be influenced by the culture conditions, including cell over-confluence 18. To evaluate whether cell density affected cholesterol detection, we measured the levels of cholesterol and cholesterol precursors in ST Kin7/7Q cells and in both clones of ST Kin109/109Q cells that were grown to over-confluence. For these experiments, rather than splitting the cells after they were confluent, they were left for another 2 days in culture, leading to ~40&#8211;50% over-confluence. In contrast to findings obtained in sub-confluent growth conditions (Fig. 2d), cholesterol was found to be increased in ST Kin109/109Q clone #6 cells compared to ST Kin7/7Q cells (Fig. 4a). Conversely, the cholesterol content was similar in ST Kin7/7Q cells and ST Kin109/109Q clone #2 cells (Fig. 4a). The lanosterol level was unchanged in both clones (Fig. 4b), while lathosterol was significantly increased only in ST Kin109/109Q clone #6 cells compared to ST Kin7/7Q cells (p<0.01) (Fig. 4c). Moreover, the levels of desmosterol and 7DHC were significantly increased in ST Kin109/109Q #6 compared to ST Kin109/109Q clone #2 cells (p<0.01) and compared to ST Kin7/7Q cells (Fig. 4d-e). These results suggest that growth conditions may affect the levels of different sterols in HD clones in different ways and that these effects are unlikely to be linked to the presence of muHTT.\nLevels of cholesterol precursors in ST Kin7/7Q and ST Kin109/109Q cells.Isotopic dilution GC-MS performed on ST Kin7/7Q and ST Kin109/109Q cells grown in standard fetal bovine serum-containing medium shows that a-b) lanosterol and lathosterol are moderately reduced in clone # 2 and #6 compared to wild-type cells, c-d) while downstream cholesterol precursors (desmosterol and 7dhc) are significantly reduced in the muHTT clones compared to wtHTT cells. The results are shown as the mean &#177; SEM of three independent experiments. Statistics: One-way ANOVA and the Newman-Keuls Multiple Comparison Test were performed.\nBecause we obtained different results in ST Kin109/109Q clone #2 and clone #6 cells, we next used mass spectrometry to measure the levels of cholesterol and cholesterol precursors in immortalized striatal cells that express the N-terminal fragment of muHTT upon doxycycline administration 5. This model allows us to measure the levels in the same cellular background with or without the expression of muHTT and to investigate differences that are linked to muHTT expression. Importantly, this circumvents clone-dependent effects. In agreement with results obtained previously using the enzymatic method 6, we found that the cholesterol level did not vary significantly in the uninduced cells compared to cells that were induced to express muHTT (33.60&#177;2.14 &#956;g chol/mg prot vs. 33.86&#177;1.76 &#956;g chol/mg prot, respectively). These cells were grown in serum-containing medium, and the exogenous cholesterol sources present in the medium may have helped the cells maintain a constant level of cellular cholesterol. On the other hand, lathosterol, which is an indicator of cholesterol biosynthesis, was reduced in cells expressing muHTT compared to cells cultured in uninduced conditions (1.647&#177;0.1048 ng latho/mg prot vs. 2.841&#177;0.2988 ng latho/mg prot, respectively; p<0.01).\nLevels of cholesterol precursors in over-confluent ST Kin7/7Q and ST Kin109/109Q cells.The same mass spectrometry analysis of cholesterol and cholesterol precursors reported in Figure 2 was also performed in cells harvested at over-confluence. a) Cholesterol levels are similar in ST Kin109/109Q clone #2 and ST Kin7/7Q but are increased in ST Kin109/109Q clone #6 compared to ST Kin7/7Q. b) Lanosterol was not significantly different in the mHTT clones and wild-type cells, while lathosterol (c) was higher in ST Kin109/109Q clone #6 compared to wild-type and ST Kin109/109Q clone #2. d-e) Similar changes are observed in the downstream cholesterol precursors desmosterol and 7dhc. Although it does not reach the significance, desmosterol and 7dhc are increased in ST Kin109/109Q clone #6 compared to ST Kin7/7Q. There are no significant differences between ST Kin109/109Q clone #6 and ST Kin7/7Q cells. The results are shown as the mean &#177; SEM from analyses in two independent experiments. Statistics: One-way ANOVA and the Newman-Keuls Multiple Comparison Test were performed.\nTaken together, these results illustrate the complexity of detecting cholesterol and its precursors in vitro and show that clonal variability and differences in cell density can lead to considerably different results.\nConclusions\nCholesterol is a structural component of biological membranes and is the precursor of numerous signalling molecules. In the brain, cholesterol is involved in neurite outgrowth, myelination and synaptic activity, and its importance in brain physiology and pathology is clear from neurological diseases in which there are changes in its level or distribution 3, \n4. Changes in sterol levels in cellular and animal models of HD have been detected in previous studies, but the direction of these changes remains a matter of debate. Specifically, while some studies report a decrease in cholesterol levels in HD models 6, \n7, \n8, \n11, \n15, others report the opposite 12, \n13, \n14.In this study, we investigated factors that could underlie these conflicting findings.As we expected, the methods used to detect cholesterol, sample preparation methods, cell line clonal properties and cell growth conditions all influenced the levels of cholesterol that were detected. It is critical to be aware of the limitations and artefacts that arise from using less sensitive methods or from inappropriate sample preparation. Colorimetric methods such as filipin staining should be avoided when the aim is quantitative detection of cholesterol levels in cells or tissue samples. Cholesterol levels may be different due to the existence of variants of what is believed to be the same cell line. In this study, we found that two clones of ST Kin cells, which were derived years ago in our laboratory at the University of Milan 16, were not, in fact, identical. The clones have been distributed by us and by collaborating laboratories to many other laboratories, as well as by direct transfer from a recipient lab to yet another lab. Different laboratory practices and mislabelling may have resulted in the propagation of cells with properties that are different from expected or that differ from lab to lab. Contrary to reports from other groups 14, \n19, we found no NMDAr or AMPAr activity and no expression of the NMDA subunit NR1 mRNA in ST-Kin cells. Genetic-based assays for the identification of cell lines 20 and the presence of a dedicated biorepository that controls the quality and distribution 21 of cell lines would reduce the risk of laboratory errors; such issues have already caused major damage in other fields 22 \n23.When a novel disease target emerges, prior to embarking in drug development initiatives, it is essential to validate the target in mammalian models of the disease. In the case of targets associated with changes in cholesterol synthesis, a reliable, sensitive detection method is key for ensuring that the results can be interpreted with confidence. When considering cholesterol homeostasis, interpretation may be even more cumbersome given the multiplicity of cellular regulatory steps and compensatory mechanisms at play; indeed, such mechanisms can present a challenge in experimental conditions. Small variations in cell culture conditions, or other confounding factors introduced in the experimental setting, may affect the results of cholesterol level determination. One study found a link between SIRT2 and cholesterol in worm, fly and cell culture HD models 13. This link should be validated using a more sensitive method to detect cholesterol 24, \n25, especially since others failed to confirm in vivo, in mouse models, SIRT2 inhibition as a therapeutic strategy in HD 26.To conclude, the hydrophobicity of different lipids, their susceptibility to oxidation in different experimental conditions, the specific extraction procedures used to obtain the desired species and the technological limitations of the methods used for measuring lipid levels, all suggest that the HD scientific community should use caution in interpreting results. In addition, it may be helpful to consult with lipid experts. Our findings make it clear that the most sensitive and reliable analytical techniques, along with appropriate sample preparation, should be used for unambiguous and unbiased measurement and interpretation of cholesterol dysfunction in the context of HD.\nMethods\n\nReagents. Filipin, Nile Red, cholesterol, M&#946;CD and simvastatin were purchased from Sigma Chemicals Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA). Filipin is unstable in solution, so a 50 mg/ml stock was prepared in DMSO and stored in aliquots at -80&#176;C to avoid freezing/thawing. The aliquots were always protected from exposure to light. Simvastatin was prepared as an 11.94 mM stock solution in DMSO. M&#946;CD was added to the medium to achieve the final indicated concentration.\nCell cultures. ST Kin7/7Q and ST Kin109/109Q cells, and inducible immortalized striatal cells expressing the first 548 amino acids of muHTT with 128 CAG repeats after doxycycline administration, were grown at 33&#176;C in high glucose DMEM (Euroclone) supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), penicillin (100 U/ml) and streptomycin (100 &#956;g /ml) plus 2 mM L-glutamine as described elsewhere 5,\n16. In the case of inducible HD cells, FBS was used that was tested to ensure that it was tetracycline-free.\nCholesterol and M&#946;CD treatment. Cells were counted and seeded in 6-well multiwell plates (for cholesterol detection with the enzymatic method or by GC-MS) or in 12-well multiwell plates (for colorimetric methods) and incubated with different concentrations of cholesterol (stock solution, 10 mg/ml in ethanol) for 16 hours or with media containing 1, 5, 10 or 25 mM M&#946;CD for 1 hour.\nImmunofluorescence staining and microscopy analysis. For Nile Red and filipin staining, the cells were plated on coverslips and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. For Nile Red staining, the cells were incubated with a solution containing 10 &#181;g/ml Nile Red for 15 min. For filipin staining, the cells were washed with 50 mM NH4Cl in PBS (2 x 5 min) to quench PFA, washed once with PBS and incubated with filipin solution (100 &#181;g/ml in PBS) for 30 min with mild agitation and protected from the light. After a wash with PBS, the cells were incubated in H2O (5 sec) to remove PBS salts and mounted with Mowiol. The stained cells were examined, and images were acquired with either a Leica DMI 6000B inverted microscope or a Leica 4000B upright microscope with LAS-AF imaging software. The images were processed using Adobe Photoshop.\nMeasurement of total cholesterol by the enzymatic method. The measurement of total sterol levels using the enzymatic method were performed on a lipid fraction isolated with solvent extraction as described by Valenza et al., 2005 and on protein lysate that was isolated as described previously by Del Toro et al., 2010. Briefly, for lipid extraction the cells in each well were washed twice with 1 ml cold PBS and 1 ml of hexane/isopropanol (3:2, v/v) was added to the well. After rocking at room temperature for 1 hour to extract the lipids, the liquid in each well was transferred to a glass tube, the solvents were removed using a stream of nitrogen at room temperature and the lipid pellets were solubilised. The protein lysate for sterol measurements was prepared with the same buffer as in Del Toro et al., 2010: ice-cold 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF, 2 mM orthovanadate, 10 ug/ml aprotinin and 1 ug/ml leupeptin. Total cholesterol was assayed in lipid extracts and protein lysates using the Amplex&#174; Red Enzyme Assay (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer&#8217;s instructions and normalized by protein concentration. The latter was determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA).\nGC-MS and isotopic-dilution mass spectrometry. Cell homogenates were prepared in PBS, and 80 &#956;l of homogenate was added to a screw-capped vial sealed with a Teflon-lined septum along with 5 &#181;g of 2H6-cholesterol and 100 ng of 2H4-lathosterol (CDN Isotopes) as internal standards. To prevent auto-oxidation, 25 &#956;l of butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) (5 g/l) and 25 &#956;l of EDTA (10 g/l) were added to each vial, and vials were flushed with argon to remove air. Alkaline hydrolysis was allowed to proceed at room temperature (22&#176;C) for 1 h in the presence of 1 M ethanolic KOH solution with magnetic stirring. After hydrolysis sterols (cholesterol, lathosterol, lanosterol, desmosterol and 7-dehydrocholesterol) were extracted two times with 5 ml of cyclohexane plus 5 mL of ethyl-acetate. The organic solvents were evaporated under a gentle stream of argon and converted into trimethylsilyl ethers [BSTFA + TMCS 1%]. GC-MS was performed on a Perkin Elmer Clarus 600C gas chromatographer- mass selective detector. The GC was equipped with a DB-XLB (30 m &#215; 0.25 mm i.d. &#215; 0.25 &#956;m film; J & W Scientific, Palo Alto, CA, USA), and the injection was performed in the splitless injection mode using helium (1 ml/min) as a carrier gas. The initial temperature of 180&#176;C was maintained for 1 min, increased by 20&#176;C/min up to 270&#176;C, then increased by 5&#176;C/min to the final temperature of 290&#176;C, which was maintained for 10 min. The mass spectrometer was used in selected ion-monitoring mode, and the neutral sterols were monitored as their TMSi derivatives using the following masses: 2H6-cholesterol at m/z 464 (M+-OTMSi); cholesterol at m/z 458 (M+-OTMSi); 2H4-lathosterol at 462 m/z (M+-OTMSi), lathosterol at 458 m/z (M+-OTMSi), desmosterol at m/z 343 (M+-OTMSi); 7-dehydrocholesterol at m/z 325 (M+-OTMSi) and lanosterol at 393 and 498 m/z (M+-OTMSi). Peak integration was performed manually, and the sterols were quantified from the selected-ion monitoring analyses by comparison with internal standards using standard curves. The identity of all of the sterols was verified by comparison with the full-scan mass spectra of authentic compounds. Additional qualifier ions (characteristic fragment ions) were used for structural identification.\nCa2+ measurements with recombinant aequorin. Before transfection, cells were seeded onto 13-mm cover glass slips for the aequorin (AEQ) measurements and allowed to grow to 70&#8211;80% confluence. The cells were transformed using the Ca2+-phosphate technique in the presence of 1.5 &#956;g AEQ cDNA. The Ca2+ measurements were carried out 48 hours after transfection. To reconstitute AEQ, the coverslips with the transfected ST Kin7/7Q cells were incubated for 65 minutes with 5 mM coelenterazine in Krebs-Ringer buffer (KRB) medium with 1 mM CaCl2 and then transferred to the perfusion chamber of a low-noise photomultiplier with a built-in amplifier-discriminator (Thorn-EMI photon counting board). All the AEQ measurements were carried out at 37&#176;C in modified KRB (135 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 0.4 mM KH2PO4, 20 mM HEPES, 0.1% glucose; pH 7.4). Each experiment began when the cells were perfused with 1 mM CaCl2. After about 30 s, cells were perfused with Mg2+-free KRB containing CaCl2 (1 mM), glutamate (100 &#956;M) and glycine (100 &#956;M) or NMDA 100 &#956;M (Invitrogen). After 120 s, ATP (100 &#956;M) was added to elicit transient Ca2+ efflux. At the end of each experiment, cells were lysed by adding 100 &#956;M digitonin in a hypotonic Ca2+-rich solution (10 mM CaCl2) to discharge the remaining unused AEQ pool. The light signal was collected by the photomultiplier and stored on an IBM-compatible computer and off-line calibrated into Ca2+ concentration values. Luminescence was calibrated off-line into Ca2+ concentration values using a computer algorithm based on the Ca2+ response curve of wild-type aequorin.\nRNA isolation and PCR measurements. Twenty-four hours after plating, AEQ-transfected and untransfected cells were harvested for RNA isolation using Trizol (Invitrogen). RNA was isolated, purified and reverse transcribed using a commercially available kit (Invitrogen). The cDNA was subjected to real time PCR amplification (CFX96, Biorad) as described in Valenza et al., 2010. PCR was carried out with the same quantity of cDNA using the following primers: NMDA subunit NR1 for: GCCTCCAGCTTCAAGAGACGT; rev: TGTGTTCCCGTCATAGGGAGAG. mGLUR1 for: GGTCCCTTCTGACACTTTGC; rev: CATTCCACTCTCGCCGTAAT. mGlUR5 for: GCCATGGTAGACATAGTGAAG; rev: TAAGAGTGGGCGATGCAAAT. NMDA 2B for: ACGGCAGCAAATCCTACTTCT; rev: ACCACTGGCTTATTGGTGACA. GAPDH for: CAAGGTCATCCATGACAACTT; rev: GGGCCATCCACAGTCTTCTG.\nStatistical analysis. Graphpad Prism v.4.0 (Graphpad software, San Diego, CA, USA) software was used to perform one-way ANOVA and Newman-Keuls Multiple Comparison post-hoc testing.\nCompeting Interests\nThe authors have declared that no competing interests exist.\nAuthors' contributions\nMM and MV performed most of the experiments and contributed to the conception and design of the experiments and the acquisition, analysis and interpretation of data; VL and CC performed all the experiments involved mass spectrometry, and VL and SDD contributed to analysis and interpretation of mass spectrometry data; CS, ADM, ECar performed all the experiments related to NMDA and contributed to analysis and interpretation of data; ECatt coordinated the study, made contribution to conception and design, to analysis and interpretation of data.

Introduction\nSevere acute pancreatitis (SAP) is a fatal disease [1]. The Atlanta Symposium criteria for the severity of acute pancreatitis define SAP as acute pancreatitis with local complications (pancreatic necrosis, abscess, and pseudocysts) and/or with systemic complications (organ failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and severe metabolic disturbances) [2] (Figure 1). Both acute necrotizing pancreatitis (ANP) and multiple-organ failure (MOF) have been shown to be significant prognostic factors [3&#8211;6]. Mortality rates for SAP patients developing ANP and MOF are 32% and 30%, respectively [7]. Early intensive care for SAP is essential for improving SAP mortality rates [8&#8211;10]. However, intensive therapies for SAP are often delayed because there is no ideal way to accurately evaluate severity in the early stages [11&#8211;13].Perfusion CT has been used for evaluation of various pancreatic diseases [14&#8211;22]. Perfusion CT has been shown useful to predict prognosis of SAP in the early stage [17, 18]. In this presented paper, we would like to review the clinical usefulness and limitations of perfusion CT for evaluation of local and systemic complications in early stage of SAP.\n2. Perfusion CT Technique\nPreviously published perfusion CT protocols are summarized in Table 1. Multidetector CT (MDCT) is essential for performing perfusion CT of pancreas. With a 4&#8211;64 slice MDCT scanner, perfusion CT scans are obtained with the patient in a stationary position. The craniocaudal CT scan coverage is limited to 20 to 32&#8201;mm (4 slices of 5 to 8&#8201;mm thickness). Therefore, scan location must be carefully chosen to cover as much of the pancreas as possible as it is often difficult to cover the entire pancreas. Since most pancreatic necrosis occurs in the neck region, it is probably uncommon to exclude the area of necrosis due to the scanning coverage limitation. With the use of a recently developed 256&#8211;320-slice MDCT scanners [19], craniocaudal coverage has increased to 80&#8211;160&#8201;mm. Alternative way to increase the craniocaudal coverage is by using the so-called shuttle or toggle mode. In this mode, similar to conventional CT scans, patient table moves back and forth as the multiple scans are performed.First, noncontrast transaxial images of the upper abdomen are obtained using low-dose technique. This scan is performed to localize the pancreas, and it determines the scan range of the perfusion CT.Perfusion CT is performed after a bolus injection of intravenous contrast material. Unlike conventional CT, the perfusion CT requires smaller dose (40&#8211;50&#8201;mL) of contrast material injected at a high rate (4&#8211;10&#8201;mL/sec). Higher concentration of contrast material (350&#8211;370&#8201;mgI/kg) is preferred [23&#8211;25].Perfusion CT images are obtained multiple times through the pancreas. In most of previous reports, scan interval ranges from 0.5 to 1.5 second, and the scan duration ranges from 30 to 150 seconds, respectively (Table 1). Total scan duration necessary for calculation of perfusion parameters may depend on the algorithm used. For example, maximum slope method needs shorter duration scan time than the deconvolution method [14, 19, 26]. Because the scan duration is long, the scans are usually performed under free breathing.Perfusion CT scan is obtained at a low tube current (mAs) to reduce radiation dose. At 120&#8201;kV, mAs of 100 is commonly used. There is increased interest in the use of low tube voltage setting, as it reduces radiation dose and improves iodine contrast material conspicuity. In a smaller patient, the use of 100&#8201;kV or 80&#8201;kV is recommended. In a larger patient, the use of low-kV scan may result in noisy images due to photon deficiency.\n2.1. Radiation Dose and Scan Parameters\nRadiation dose is dependent on the tube current (mAs), tube voltage (kV), number of scans, and scan coverage [29]. Tube current (mAs) and tube voltage (kV) are largely dictated by the patient size to maintain adequate image quality. Radiation dose should be kept as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA) by reducing the scanning parameter settings but achieving image dataset adequate for calculating CT perfusion parameters [27, 30]. Further study is necessary to optimize the scanning protocol.From a European study, the effective dose of pancreatic perfusion CT was 3.54&#8201;mSv with 90&#8201;KV, 100&#8201;mAs, and 40 scans [17]. A study from Japan reported that mean radiation dose of pancreatic perfusion CT was approximately 204.8&#8201;mGy&#183;cm (dose-length product (DLPw)), 3.07 mSv (effective dose), and 64&#8201;mGy (CT dose index volume (CTDIvol)) with 80&#8201;kV, 60&#8201;mAs, and 106 scans [27]. In the national survey, the radiation exposure of a single-phase abdominal CT was 13&#8211;25 mGy (CTDIvol) [31]. Therefore, the radiation dose of perfusion CT is slightly higher than that of biphasic (two phase), which is commonly used for pancreatic or liver imaging. Average abdominal transverse diameter of the Japanese patients in our experience was 32&#8201;cm, while transverse diameters of patients in the Unites States are usually larger [32]. Therefore, the radiation dose will likely be higher in the western countries\n2.2. Perfusion CT Data Analysis\nPancreatic perfusion CT image data are analyzed by using perfusion CT analysis software. There are various perfusion algorithms to calculate perfusion parameters. Maximum slope method, deconvolution method, single-compartment method, and the Patlak method are commonly used perfusion algorithms. Which perfusion best suits in the evaluation of SAP is yet to be determined. As different perfusion algorithms are suited for different disease processes and require different scanning protocol, determination of scanning protocol and perfusion algorithms should be considered together. For example, maximum slope method may require shorter scanning duration, but higher rate of contrast injection is required, while deconvolution method may require longer scanning duration but slower rate of contrast injection rate [14, 26].The software requires placement of small regions of interest (ROI) on an artery to generate arterial input function. Venous outflow function is required in deconvolution method. This process is required because the computer algorithm compares the shape and height of the time-density curve of each pixel of the pancreatic CT time series with shape and height of the arterial and/or venous time-density curves to calculate pancreatic perfusion parameters. Calculated pancreatic perfusion parameters are displayed using color maps [14].\n3. Perfusion CT for Predicting Development of Pancreatic Necrosis in the Early Stage of Severe Acute Pancreatitis\nDevelopment of pancreatic necrosis is the critical event of acute pancreatitis that determines the prognosis of the patients. The overall mortality rate of acute pancreatitis is reported to be between 2.1% and 9.2% worldwide [1]. Pancreatic necrosis occurs in 10&#8211;15% of patients with SAP, with a mortality rate of 23% [1]. This rate is nearly twice that for patients with SAP who do not develop pancreatic necrosis (i.e., 11%) [1].There is a report that dynamic contrast-enhanced CT is more accurate than either the Ranson criteria for pancreatitis mortality or the APACHE II scoring system in predicting the development of pancreatic necrosis [33]. However, the accuracy of contrast-enhanced CT in predicting necrosis at an early stage of SAP is not satisfactory [34]. The United Kingdom guidelines for the management of acute pancreatitis, the most popular clinical guideline of acute pancreatitis, recommends that contrast-enhanced CT should be performed at day 3 or later after onset of SAP because of its low sensitivity of CT [11].In our experience, perfusion CT performed within 3 days of onset of symptoms had a sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 95.3% for predicting development of pancreatic necrosis [18]. The area of necrosis was depicted as area of pancreatic blood flow decreased by more than 19.3% of surrounding pancreatic parenchyma. The area of perfusion defect was commonly diagnosed by using pancreatic blood flow. The perfusion defects detected by perfusion CT reflected ischemia which was produced by vasospasms of the intrapancreatic arteries [35, 36].\n4. Perfusion CT for Evaluating Systemic Blood Flow\nPerfusion CT could be a useful tool to evaluate abnormal systemic circulation in early stage of SAP. Recent study by Whitcomb et al. showed that elevated serum angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) on admission is predictive of persistent organ failure in patients with sap [37]. Ang-2 is produced by damaged vessels and increases vascular permeability [38]. In our study, elevated serum Ang-2 is related with hyperdynamic state of systemic circulation [22]. In this study, perfusion CT parameter (&#964;) was calculated using single-compartment model [28, 39]. &#964; is a measure of the mean transit time of contrast material from upper abdominal aorta to pancreas; thus, this could be considered a surrogate of systemic circulation with a lower value indicating hyperdynamic state of systemic circulation [28]. In the result, significant correlation was found between &#964; and serum Ang-2 levels (P < 0.05); higher serum Ang-2 levels were associated with lower &#964; values (hyperdynamic state of systemic circulation).Hepatic circulation abnormality has been reported in patients with SAP using Perfusion CT [40]. They reported that hepatic arterial perfusion is increased in the early stage of SAP as measured on dual-input maximum slope method.\n5. Clinical Utility of Pancreatic Perfusion CT\nEarly diagnosis of pancreatic necrosis is very important in the treatment of patients with SAP. Current methods to predict early pancreatic necrosis or SAP is not satisfactory [11&#8211;13]. Perfusion CT is a promising technique that allows accurate diagnosis of pancreatic necrosis. Early diagnosis allows prompt clinical decision such as transferring patients to ICU or institution of aggressive treatment such as anticoagulation therapy [41], continuous regional arterial infusion of antiprothrombin agent [8, 9], early fluid resuscitation [10], and molecular targeted therapy [42, 43].\n6.

Subsequently, Ubero-Pascal and Sartori (2009) revised this genus and placed 15 species into it. The nymphs of this genus include several ecological and adaptive types, each with differing morphologies, especially mouthparts. They may be filter-feeders using maxillae (like Uracanthella), biters or shredders (Amurella), or cutters and predators having enlarged mandibles (Kangella).In this study, a new ecological type and evolutionary lineage of this genus is found in Hainan Island, southern China. The nymphs have large labia, elongated labial palpi with long setae, and forelegs with rows of long setae. The setaceous mouthparts and forelegs show this species can filter particle food items in running water.\nMaterials and methods\nThe nymphs were collected by hand net. Some adults were reared from mature nymphs indoor but most were attracted by ultraviolet collecting light. The materials were stored into ethanol (more than 75%) immediately. All specimens were photographed with a digital camera (Single Lens Reflex) and examined under a stereomicroscope. Some small structures, such as mouthparts, claws, and gills were observed and photographed with a microscope camera.Eggs were dissected out from females. Before being placed on the stage of the SEM (scanning electron microscope) for photographs, they were prepared with a standard protocol: fixed in 4% glutaraldehyde for 4&#8211;8 hours, rinsed with PBS (physiological saline) 2&#8211;3 times (10&#8211;15 minutes each), dehydrated in concentration gradient acetone (30%, 50%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%, 10 to 15 minutes each), and coated with gold film in a vacuum.Comparative material used in this study includes:\nTeloganopsis\npunctisetae (Matsumura, 1931) (=Ephemerella\nrufa Imanishi, 1937, synonymized by Ishiwata, 2001): 2&#9794;&#9794;3&#9792;&#9792;4L, Xin-Huang county (27&#176;19.10&#8242;N, 109&#176;14.05&#8242;E, alt. 352 m), Hunan Province, China, collected by Peng LI, Jia-Yong ZHANG, 16 Aug 2004.\nTeloganopsis\njinghongensis (Xu et al., 1984): 2&#9794;&#9794;3&#9792;&#9792;3L, Er-Yuan town (26&#176;15.26&#8242;N, 99&#176;58.55&#8242;E, alt. 2093 m), Da-Li, Yunnan Province, China, collected by Hui XIE, Ping CHEN, Yan-Yan JIA, 7 July 2008.Abbreviations used in text: C, costal vein; Sc, subcostal vein; SEM, scanning electron microscope.All specimens are deposited in the Mayfly Collection, College of Life Sciences, Nanjing Normal University, China.\nResults\n\nNone\nZhou\nsp. n.http://zoobank.org/507C1DC5-0D06-41BF-9320-74B75695901DFigs 1\n, 2\n, 3\n, 4\n, 5\n, 6\n, 7\n\nHolotype.\n&#9794;, Ba-Wang-Ling National Forest Park (19&#176;12.12&#8242;N, 109&#176;09.35&#8242;E, alt. 300 m), Chang-Jiang county, Hainan Province, China, collected by Qin SI, Jun-Zhi SUN, Juan-Yan LUO, 16 Nov 2015; Paratypes: 2&#9794;&#9794;1&#9794;subimago 2&#9792;&#9792;30L, same as the holotype.\nDiagnosis.\n\nNymph: Inner margins of forelegs and mouthparts (labrum, mandibles, and labium) have dense and long setae.

It indicates here that the nymphs of the new species have long and dense setae on the mouthparts and forelegs.\nRemarks\nBased on the following characters (gills on abdominal segments III&#8211;VII, ventral lamellae of gills IV (on segment VI) bifurcated, body without any tubercles or projections, maxillae without palpi and shape of claw), the nymph of this new species belongs to the genus Teloganopsis based on the nymphal keys provided by Jacobus and McCafferty (2008) and Ubero-Pascal and Sartori (2009). The proximal hook of the forelegs, the shape of the penis, and forceps also imply that the male imagoes of this new species belong to the genus Teloganopsis.In the nymphal key of all known species of the genus Teloganopsis prepared by Ubero-Pascal and Sartori (2009), T.\nsetosa sp. n. is most similar to the species T.\npuigae because of their uniform body color pattern, missing maxillary palpi, and without any tubercles on body. However, the setal pattern on the forelegs and the shapes of maxillae and labia are different. The nymphs of T.\nsetosa sp. n. have longer setae on forelegs and longer labial palpi. In the imaginal stage of these two species, the shape of their hindwings and abdominal colour patterns are dissimilar. The hindwing of T.\nsetosa sp. n. has a shallow marginal projection while the counterpart in T.\npuigae has a larger and sharper projection. Furthermore, the imaginal abdomen of the latter species is uniformly dark while that of T.\nsetosa sp. n. is pale with a pair of reddish brown dots on tergum IV.Among Chinese ephemerelliids belonging to the genus Teloganopsis, the nymphs of T.\nsetosa sp. n. is closest to T.\npunctisetae (Matsumura, 1931) and T.\njinghongensis (Xu et al., 1984) as they have no maxillary palpi nor any tubercles on the body. As imagoes, they are also similar because of their longer tibiae (distinctly longer than the femora and tarsi) on the forelegs and the morphology of the genitalia (penis with dorsal projection).However, the nymph of T.\nsetosa sp. n. is unique because of its setaceous mouthparts and forelegs. Four diagnostic characters are remarkable: 1) the outer margin of mandible has long setae (Figs 3B&#8211;C, 4C&#8211;D); 2) the paraglossae of the labium are expanded and bear dense setae ventrally (Figs 3E, 4G); 3) segment II of the labial palpi are greatly elongated and have setae dorsally (Figs 3E, 4G); 4) forelegs possess long setae (Figs 1, 2, 3G, 4K). The absence of projections, spines, or tubercles on nymphal body also contributes to its identification (Figs 1, 2). Besides these characters, when compared to the similar species T.\npunctisetae and T.\njinghongensis, the nymph of this new species has more and longer setae on its mouthparts (the setae on the labrum, maxillae, hypopharynx, and labium are more numerous and denser). The nymphal femora of the new species are broader, with fewer spines compared to those of T.\npunctisetae and T.\njinghongensis, and their color pattern is different. Tergum IV of Teloganopsis\nsetosa sp. n. is more colorful than that of these two species (Fig. 1), while the latter two species have longitudinal pale stripes on body (Fig. 8A, B), which are not present in the new species.In male imagoes, however, the distinguishing characters of the new species mostly rely on color; 1) the penes and dorsolateral projections of the penes are larger and more distinctive than those of T.\npunctisetae and T.\njinghongensis (Figs 5E, 6D, 8C, 8D); 2) the caudal filaments of T.\nsetosa sp. n. have broad reddish brown bands on the basal half of each segment (Fig. 5A) while those of the T.\npunctisetae and T.\njinghongensis have rings on the articulations, while broad bands are rare; 3) both the male and female of T.\nsetosa sp. n. have relatively obvious and big spots on tergum IV (Fig. 5A) but in T.\npunctisetae and T.\njinghongensis there are no recognizable markings on the terga.\nKey to the three close Chinese \n\nKey to the three close Chinese \n\nDiscussion\nMayflies with setaceous mouthparts, elongated maxillary labial palpi, and long setae on the forelegs have been found in several lineages in the order Ephemeroptera, such as Isonychia (Isonychiidae), Nathanella (Leptophlebiidae), Rhoenanthus (Potamanthidae), Oligoneuriella (Oligoneuriidae), Tricorythus (Tricorythidae), and Clypeocaenis (Caenidae). In the Ephemerellidae, as far as we know, no similar form has been reported. This new species represents a new evolutionary type in the family, but compared to related species such as T.\npunctisetae and T.\njinghongensis, their nymphal body patterns are similar, and the adults are alike. Most importantly, the setaceous mouthparts and brush-like maxillae are also found in T.\npunctisetae at least, so there is no need to erect a new generic level for it. Based on the habit, habitat, and behavioural information provided by Needham et al. (1935), Edmunds et al. (1976), and Elpers and Tomka (1995), the mayfly nymphs with setaceous mouthparts and forelegs are usually filter-feeding. Based upon its characters, the new species described in this paper is also believed to be filter-feeder. Most ephemerellid nymphs usually live in and feed on the aquatic spirogyra or branches and leaves stacked in the lentic or lotic water. The Teloganopsis\nsetosa sp. n. nymph may have evolved the ability to collect organic particles from flowing water using their long and dense setae on forelegs and mouthparts, just like the Isonychia and Clypeocaenis mayflies.\nSupplementary Material\n", "pmid": "29391846", "title": "A new species of the genus Teloganopsis with setaceous mouthparts and forelegs from southern China (Ephemeroptera, Ephemerellidae)", "journal_title": "ZooKeys", "authors": "Wei Zhang;Zhen-Xing Ma;Ze Hu;Juan-Yan Luo;Chang-Fa Zhou", "doi": "10.3897/zookeys.714.13646", "score": "0.0033082808"}, {"keywords": "", "abstract": "The structural analysis of polysaccharides requires that\nthe sugar\ncomponents and their absolute configurations are determined.

The\nabsolute configuration of sugar residues may also be determined by 1H NMR spectroscopy, once the oligo- or polysaccharide hydrolysate\nhas been acylated by a chiral acyl ester.(8) The technique was recently used successfully for the determination\nof the absolute configurations of the sugar components of the exopolysaccharide\nfrom Streptococcus thermophilus ST1.(9) Recent technological developments in probe design and miniaturization\npromise significant increase in sensitivity of NMR spectroscopy such\nthat NMR data may be acquired at low nanomolar concentrations, thereby\nalleviating the problem of low sensitivity of the NMR technique.(10)In the present communication we present\na protocol for rapid and\nautomatic structure determination of oligo- and polysaccharides based\nsolely on NMR spectroscopy. The conventional and manual analyses of\ngas chromatograms and 2D NMR spectra are time-consuming and prone\nto errors. We here present a method in which the structure of glycans\ncan be determined solely by NMR spectroscopy in a highly automatic\nway using just a few NMR spectra. The CCPN Analysis software(11) is used to handle unassigned resonances in the\nspectra, prior to analysis with the CASPER (computer assisted spectrum\nevaluation of regular polysaccharides) program.(12) The sequence analysis is performed by CASPER, based on\nNMR chemical shifts and how they change when sugar residues are linked\ntogether, and in particular using information from HMBC spectra as\ndescribed before.(12) Component analysis\nis the last step toward automatic structure determination by NMR spectroscopy.\nExperimental Section\n\nPreparation of (+)- and (\u2212)-2-Butyl Glycosides of Non-Amino\nSugars\nThe monosaccharide (5 mg) was dissolved in (+)-(S)- or (&#8722;)-(R)-2-butanol (0.5 mL),\nfollowed\nby addition of acetyl chloride (75 &#956;L).

Chemical shifts are reported in ppm using\ninternal sodium 3-trimethylsilyl-(2,2,3,3-2H4)-propanoate (TSP, &#948;H 0.00) or external 1,4-dioxane\nin D2O (&#948;C 67.40) as references.1D and 2D NMR spectra of the O-antigen polysaccharide of Klebsiella pneumoniae strain 22535 (5.2 mg) and the (+)-2-butyl\nglycosides of the hydrolyzed polysaccharide were recorded at 700 MHz\nto reduce spectral overlap and 500 MHz, respectively. NMR spectra\nof the O-antigen polysaccharide of Escherichia coli O101 (9.6 mg) and the (+)-2-butyl glycosides of the hydrolyzed polysaccharide\nwere carried out at 500 and 700 MHz, respectively. Measurements were\nmade at 40 &#176;C for the O-antigen polysaccharide of Escherichia\ncoli O101 and at 70 &#176;C for all the other samples.1H and 13C NMR chemical shifts assignments\nof the (+)- and (&#8722;)-2-butyl glycosides were performed on different\nspectrometers (400, 500, and 600 MHz) at 70 &#176;C. 1H\nchemical shifts assignments were performed using 1H,1H-TOCSY experiments with two different mixing times (10 and\n70 ms). 13C NMR chemical shifts were assigned using 1H,13C-HMBC and proton decoupled 1H,13C-HSQC experiments.\nResults and Discussion\nA very common way in the analysis\nof absolute configuration of\nsugar residues is to derivatize the unknown components of a sample\nwith an optically active alcohol, e.g., (+)- or (&#8722;)-2-butanol.\nThe glycosides that are obtained are subsequently compared to standards\nmade from the (+)- or (&#8722;)-forms of the alcohol and analyzed\nby gas chromatography.(7) Furthermore, monosaccharides\nhave been used to determine the absolute configuration of 2-butanol\nby 1H NMR spectroscopy.(16) We\nhere extend the above approaches to a general method, in which the\nsugar residues of an oligo- or polysaccharide may be determined solely\nby NMR spectroscopy including the absolute configurations of the constituent\nsugar residues. Once the NMR data have been acquired for the reference\ncompounds and stored in the database utilized by CASPER, reference\nmaterial do not have to be prepared each time; only the unknown sample\nhas to be analyzed by 1D or 2D NMR experiments.The CASPER program\nuses the 1H and 13C NMR\nchemical shifts of the monosaccharides and methyl glycosides as part\nof the process to predict NMR chemical shifts of oligo- or polysaccharides.(17) Thus, from a hydrolysate or methanolysis of\na carbohydrate-containing material, one should be able to identify\nthe sugar components present, albeit without the determination of\ntheir absolute configurations(s). In the present developments we have\nprepared reference substances based on butanolysis of monosaccharides\nwith (+)- and (&#8722;)-2-butanol that give the corresponding 2-butyl\nglycosides with characteristic 1H and 13C NMR\nchemical shifts (Tables S2.1 and S2.2).\nDepending on the monosaccharide the &#945;- and &#946;-anomeric\nforms of the pyranosides as well as the furanosides will be present\nto a different extent. Since the methodology is based on a computerized\nanalysis, the mixture of anomeric and ring forms is not regarded as\na limitation but will instead be used in advantageous way, acting\nas a fingerprint, to identify the sugar residues and their absolute\nconfigurations. Note that the (+)-d-sugar will give an identical\nNMR spectrum to that of the (&#8722;)-l-sugar, since they\nare enantiomers. Consequently, from a practical point of view, either\nof the 2-butanol enantiomers may be used in the analysis of an unknown\nsample (provided that reference data of the sugar are available for\nCASPER to analyze). The methodology is outlined in Scheme 1.The sugar component analysis method uses NMR\nchemical shifts from 1H,13C and/or 1H,13C-HSQC\nspectra as input. The chemical shifts of the &#945;- and &#946;-anomeric\nforms as well as different ring forms (if available) for the monosaccharide\nresidues in the CASPER database that match the lysis method used,\ni.e., hydrolysis, methanolysis, or butanolysis, are compared to the\nexperimental data. The tests are performed for one monosaccharide\nat a time, and the chemical shifts and/or correlations from 2D HSQC\nspectra are matched to the closest experimental signal, allowing the\nsame signal to be used more than once. This means that it is not necessary\nto integrate the signals or completely resolve overlapping peaks,\nbut on the other hand, some submitted signals might not be used. 1D 1H and 13C chemical shift deviations are the absolute\ndifference between experimental data and the database entries, whereas\nthe HSQC difference is the distance between the 2D coordinates multiplying\nthe 13C chemical shift separation by 0.2. If the difference\nof the best match of a peak/cross-peak from an atom/atom pair in a\nresidue is larger than 0.05, 0.25, or 0.25 ppm for 1H,13C and 1H,13C-HSQC data, respectively,\nthe deviation is set to that upper limit and no match is made. The\ndifferent experiment types have distinctive thresholds: the cutoffs\nare 0.15, 0.75, and 0.75 ppm for 1H,13C and 1H,13C-HSQC data, respectively. The maximum deviation\nper signal is based upon the signal assignment tolerances used by\nCASPER, whereas the thresholds for each experiment type were chosen\nafter testing the sugar component analysis module. If at least half\nof the signals of each experiment type can be assigned for a component\nform (&#945;- and &#946;-anomeric forms as well as pyranose and\nfuranose ring forms), the deviations of that form will be counted.\nThis means that a sugar component will not be discarded just because,\ne.g., the signals from the furanose form are not observed. If the\nresonance deviations of a component (divided by the number of forms,\nof which deviations were counted) are below the total thresholds of\nall experimental data types submitted, it will be proposed by CASPER\nas a component and listed in the results along with its deviations\nand the experimental chemical shifts used for matching this residue.\nIf there are experimental signals that are not used for matching any\nof the suggested residues, they will also be listed. It is common\nthat there are unused signals, especially if they are close to each\nother, since only the best match between experimental and database\nchemical shifts are used. The presence of several unused chemical\nshifts may indicate that an additional sugar component, which was\nnot identified by CASPER, is present in the investigated material\nor that a substituent has not been accounted for, which highlights\nthat in such cases further detailed analysis of the NMR spectra is\nrequired (Scheme S1.1).The fully\ncomputerized structure determination approach based on\nunassigned NMR spectra is presented for two O-antigen polysaccharides,\nfrom Klebsiella pneumoniae strain 22535 and Escherichia coli O101,14,15 shown in Figure 1. In order to obtain an efficient way of handling\nNMR data we have developed the possibility of uploading CCPN projects\ndirectly into the CASPER interface. In the current implementation(12) a set of NMR data, acquired on the oligo- or\npolysaccharide, e.g., the 1D 13C NMR spectrum, 2D 1H,13C-HSQC (Figure 2a&#8211;c), 1H,13C-H2BC, and 1H,13C-HMBC\nspectra, from which 1H and 13C NMR chemical\nshifts have been obtained by peak-picking using the CCPN Analysis\nsoftware,(11) is used for the structure determination\nprocedure.From butanolysis of the Klebsiella pneumoniae polysaccharide\none set of resonances is observed in the 13C and/or 1H,13C-HSQC spectra (Figure 2d&#8211;f), whereas the butanolyzed monosaccharides give distinctly\ndifferent NMR spectra for the (+)- and (&#8722;)-forms (Figure 2g&#8211;i), and this chemical shift information\nis used for the analysis procedure. The data from the butanolyzed\npolysaccharide are utilized in a second CCPN project which is submitted\nto CASPER and execution of the absolute configuration module determines\nthe sugars present in the polysaccharide and their absolute configuration(s)\nin &#8764;5 s. The lists of the signals expected to come from the\nsugars in the CCPN projects are presented in Tables\nS3.1 and S3.2. The resulting sugar components (for a detailed\nlist of results see Tables S4.1 and S4.2) are subsequently transferred to the structure determination module/interface\nwhere now the sugar residues automatically are entered with their\nappropriate absolute configuration(s), but where the linkage positions\nare unknown. The number of the constituent residues is not determined\nfrom the component analysis, requiring the user to specify that in\nthe structure determination input. In this case, that meant that five l-rhamnose residues were selected instead of one, which was\nidentified from the component analysis of the Klebsiella pneumoniae polysaccharide. The subsequent structure determination then returns\na list of structures ranked according to their agreement to experimental\ndata. The correct structures of both polysaccharides are top ranked\nin the results (see Tables S5.1 and S5.2) with large margins to the second candidate. For the E.\ncoli O101 polysaccharide the relative difference between\nthe two highest ranked structures is 1.25, and the second Klebsiella pneumoniae polysaccharide structure suggestion\nhas a relative deviation, compared to the best structure, of 1.30,\nboth of which are significantly large to rule out the second option\nas a probable structure candidate.(12) The\nstructure determinations took approximately 5 and 35 s for the E. coli O101 and Klebsiella pneumoniae polysaccharides,\nrespectively, and the results, which are in full agreement with the\nprevious structural studies,14,15 are shown in Tables S5.1 and S5.2. Subsequently, 1H and 13C NMR chemical shift assignments (listed in Tables S6.1 and S6.2) are then transferred back\ninto the CCPN project, and further analysis may be carried out in\nCCPN analysis in which the 1H and 13C NMR resonances\nnow are assigned to atoms of the sugar residues. The limitation of\nthe methodology is the absence of NMR chemical shifts in the database\nfor some sugar components or oligosaccharides, but this is continuously\naddressed by adding assigned NMR chemical shift data; e.g., the 1H and 13C NMR chemical shifts of butanolyzed uronic\nacids are presently being analyzed and will subsequently be included\nas part of the database. At the present time the method requires &#8764;1\nmg of polysaccharide which may be complex, but it should have a regular\nstructure with repeating units. Impure and/or heterogeneous samples\nmay lead to larger differences between experimentally acquired chemical\nshifts and those predicted by CASPER; consequently, the credence to\nthe proposed structure will then be lower. Thus, robust purification\nprocedures and techniques are essential to apply prior to utilizing\nthe computerized CASPER approach based on unassigned NMR data. The\nslightly larger deviations between calculated and experimental 13C NMR chemical shifts for the E. coli O101\npolysaccharide compared to the Klebsiella pneumoniae polysaccharide are due to model approximations and available oligosaccharides\nin the current database. To a small extent also the different temperature\n(40 &#176;C) of acquisition of NMR experiments for the E.\ncoli O101 polysaccharide compared to the temperature (70\n&#176;C) at which the database is compiled may lead to small deviations.\nHowever, this example shows that it is possible to acquire the experimental\nNMR data at a temperature different from that of the database and\nstill determine the polysaccharide structure in an efficient way.\nIn the present study two polysaccharides having linear repeating units\nwere presented, but the absolute configuration methodology is likewise\napplicable to branched polysaccharides. The recent developments have\nbeen made available to the scientific community via the Internet (http://www.casper.organ.su.se/casper).12,17In conclusion, we have presented a fully automatic procedure\nto\ndetermine the primary structure of a regular polysaccharide based\non NMR spectroscopy only in which the absolute configuration determination\nof the sugar components is obtained from unassigned NMR spectra. Furthermore,\nonce the monosaccharide NMR reference data have been added to the\ndatabase, references do not have to be prepared for each new and unknown\nsample. Only one butanolyzed sample of the material whose structure\nshould be determined needs to be prepared.", "pmid": "21955217", "title": "Automatic Structure Determination\nof Regular Polysaccharides\nBased Solely on NMR Spectroscopy", "journal_title": "Biomacromolecules", "authors": "Magnus Lundborg;Carolina Fontana;G\u00f6ran Widmalm", "doi": "10.1021/bm201169y", "score": "0.0032290635"}, {"keywords": "saliva;biomarker;acute myocardial infarction;proteomics;type-2 diabetes mellitus", "abstract": "Human saliva plays a pivotal role in digesting food and maintaining oral hygiene.

Current challenges in saliva collection are also addressed to improve the quality of saliva samples and produce robust biomarkers for future use in clinical applications.", "body": "Introduction\nHuman saliva is a biological fluid with myriad of biological functions important for the maintenance of oral and general health. It is a plasma ultra-filtrate containing proteins either synthesized in situ from blood or in the salivary glands 1. Major salivary glands consisting of submandibular glands, sublingual glands, and parotid glands lie at the vicinity of the oral cavity whereas other minor exocrine glands lie beneath the oral mucosa 2. Several roles of saliva in the oral cavity include lubrication and binding, solubilisation of dry food, oral hygiene, and initiation of starch digestion 3. Apart from water as its major constituent, whole saliva also contains bacterial and exfoliated cells, electrolytes, glycoproteins, enzymes, and antibacterial compounds. Likewise, minute amounts of gingival crevicular fluid coexist with saliva in the gingival crevice surrounding the teeth 4.Changes in saliva quality and quantity are indicative of the wellness of the patient 5. Human saliva, as a mirror of oral and systemic health, provides valuable information because it contains biomarkers specific for the unique physiologic aspects of periodontal and systemic diseases. Proteomic markers from immunoglobulins to bone remodelling proteins were previously discovered in existing periodontal diseases 6. In one study, salivary epidermal growth factor was found to be significantly raised in women with active and nonactive breast cancer compared to healthy women 7. Compared to blood, saliva has been clinically shown to produce more accurate, inexpensive, and convenient results. The diagnostic potential of this fluid has been studied in many laboratories in order to find its advantages over other biological fluids and potential biomarkers in numerous diseases. Unlike plasma, saliva can be readily used for tests since it will not clot. Its noninvasive approach renders this biological fluid an effective alternative to blood and urine testing in monitoring patient's health condition 8.Whole saliva can be easily collected by drooling, spitting, or swabbing into a designated tube as opposed to invasive blood collection procedure. These methods of obtaining saliva pose minimal risk of contracting deadly pathogens to the healthcare professionals. Plus, sufficient quantities of saliva can be easily obtained for analysis by a practitioner even with modest training. For diagnostic and research purposes, saliva collection kits have been commercially marketed worldwide including Oragene.DISCOVER from DNA Genotek Inc., UltraSal-2&#8482; from Oasis Diagnostics, OraSure&#174; Oral Specimen Collection Device from OraSure Technologies, Inc., Certus&#174; Collection Device from Alere&#8482;, and Saliva Collection System from Greiner Bio-One. In one study, budget estimates for both blood and saliva collections were developed by a group of scientists incorporating personnel expenses and corresponding collection methods into the calculation. When comparing both budget estimates, saliva collection was proven to be 48% less costly than blood collection 9. These advantages have attracted many researchers to study and identify potential salivary biomarkers with unparalleled opportunities for clinical applications.As illustrated in Figure 1, human salivary proteomes exhibit promising potential as biomarkers to predict the onset of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), or heart attack. On a global scale, the disease remains the primary cause of morbidity and mortality. This pathologic event occurs as a result of acute myocardial ischemia when there is evidence of myocardial necrosis 10. According to World Health Organization 11, this disease is one of the major forms of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in which its prevalence constitutes approximately 48% of all deaths in 2008, affecting more than 17 million patients around the globe. Other AMI complications may include severe cardiac disability upon survival of the onset 12.Since AMI is the leading cause of death worldwide, this disease has been selected among other systemic diseases in this review. Recent salivary findings and progress pertaining to this condition will be discussed to elucidate the promising use of saliva as a diagnostic fluid in acute cardiac care among a very high-risk group of type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), as well as relevant methods employed. Current challenges in saliva collection will be highlighted for further improvement on the quality of salivary biomarkers discovered in future.\nHuman salivary proteomes as biomarkers\nBiomarkers can be indicative of a specific physiological or pathological state of a biological fluid including blood and saliva 13. Many researchers worldwide have been studying the use of biomarkers due to its ability to monitor susceptibility, progression, and resolution of diseases, health condition, and treatment outcome. Despite the variability of the term &#8220;biomarker&#8221; used in diverse aspects of its applications, the most comprehensible definition of biomarker is &#8220;cellular, biochemical, molecular, or genetic alterations by which a normal, abnormal, or simple biological process can be recognized or monitored&#8221; 14. Any molecular species which demonstrates significant variation in concentration, as compared to those of control subjects, is a potential biomarker. Therefore, if expression of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist is significantly enhanced compared to the normal group, the protein can be potentially targeted as an early biomarker to indicate risks of tobacco-related diseases 15.Saliva contains biomarkers derived from serum, gingival crevicular fluid, and mucosal transudate which are useful in multiplexed assays that are being developed as point-of-care devices, rapid tests, or in more standardized formats for centralized clinical laboratory operations 16. The prospect of salivary diagnosis appeals to many scientists around the world for disease prognosis and diagnosis. Current discoveries on potential salivary biomarkers encompass various systemic diseases such as autoimmune diseases, bone turnover markers, cardiovascular markers, dental caries and periodontal diseases, diseases of the adrenal cortex, drug level monitoring, forensic evidence, genetic disorders, infections, malignancy, occupational and environmental medicine, psychological research, and renal diseases 17. In oral squamous cell carcinoma, Ni et al.\n18 acquired several potential salivary biomarkers corresponding to early detection and evaluation of aggressiveness and occurrence of the cancer based on recent researches. As such, further salivary investigation can yield more comprehensive information about this fluid especially in the field of health medicine.Apart from genomics and metabolomics, salivary proteomics 19 has demonstrated a great potential and has been widely utilised as a means to identify candidate biomarkers and possible immunochemistry markers for various illnesses predominantly infectious and neoplastic diseases 20. In peptide identification, Mass Spectrometry (MS)-based proteomic techniques have been commonly applied including two-dimensional gel electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (2-DE/MS), liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-ToF/MS), and surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-ToF/MS) 21. By employing one of MS-based proteomic techniques, Chan et al.\n22 detected significant altered abundance of polymeric immunoglobulin receptor, plastin-2, actin related protein 3, leukocyte elastase inhibitor, carbonic anhydrases 6, immunoglobulin J, and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist among T2DM patients with periodontitis compared to their control T2DM cohorts. Additionally, Jessie et al.\n23, 24 detected increased abundance and structural microheterogeneity of haptoglobin beta chains in the saliva of patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma which were also subsequently observed in the saliva of habitual betel quid chewers. Many other salivary biomarkers with diagnostic potential were already characterised in oncology, head and neck carcinoma, breast and gastric cancers, salivary gland function and disease, Sj&#246;gren syndrome, systemic sclerosis, dental and gingival pathology, systemic, psychiatric, and neurological diseases using MS-based proteomics 25. It is possible that efficiency and accuracy of these proteomic technologies will turn salivary diagnostics into a clinical reality.\nSalivary proteomes in relation to AMI\nThe prospect of utilizing saliva samples in the diagnosis of AMI is appealing to a large group of scientists due to its noninvasive and economical nature. Extensive biomarker research on CVD has elucidated various proteins associated with this disease. Since approximately 27% of the whole saliva proteins resemble those found in plasma 26, similar proteins present in both saliva and plasma will be very useful to facilitate monitoring of both disease progression and therapeutic treatments among these patients. In association with AMI, some studies on plasma proteins revealed significant biomarkers involved in myocardial injury, myocardial stress, inflammation, neuroendocrine activation, atherosclerotic process, platelet activation, plaque instability, endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and myocardial stretch. Out of all these proteins, natriuretic peptides, C-reactive protein (CRP), creatine kinase (CK), and cardiac troponin were included as commonly used cardiac biomarkers in acute cardiac care 27. In a clinical setting, a kit for measuring human salivary CRP, a common biomarker related to cardiovascular inflammation, has been developed by Salimetrics&#174;. Another recent cutting-edge technology is Oral Fluid NanoSensor Test (OFNASET) which provides portable, cheap, accurate, definitive, and quantitative results. Besides its intended use in oral cancer, this particular alternative can possibly benefit the point-of-care multiplex detection of salivary biomarkers among AMI patients 28. Given the above-mentioned clinical benefits of saliva collection, a patient's salivary proteome should be very useful in determining heart condition of the patient in order to predict AMI. Several studies have demonstrated salivary biomarkers associated with AMI, as shown in Table 1. By comparing these salivary biomarkers with those in plasma, as elaborated by Kossaify et al. 27, CRP, CK, CD40 ligand, cardiac troponin I, cardiac troponin T, some families of interleukin (IL), tumour necrosis factor alpha, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), and myeloperoxidase share similarities with plasma biomarkers which also play significant roles in inflammation and plaque instability (Figure 2). Although these discoveries may enlighten the diagnostic utility of salivary proteomes as biomarkers in relation to CVD, none of the salivary biomarkers listed above have been verified to predict the onset of AMI. All of these studies, as tabulated in table 1, were conducted retrospectively after the incidence. On the other hand, prospective studies should be able to alternatively facilitate the researchers to find predictive AMI biomarkers. In future, these newly detected salivary biomarkers will conceivably provide an early molecular diagnosis and eventually increase the survival rate of cardiovascular patients as opposed to that of plasma. However, more validation needs to be carried out in order to find robust and discriminatory biomarkers for this disease.\nSusceptibility of AMI among patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus\nT2DM is an inflammatory illness with a clear-cut relationship with CVD. This is validated when heart disease and stroke constitute no less than 70 percent of mortality among people with this metabolic disorder 39, rendering the T2DM patients to fall into a high-risk group to be later inflicted by AMI. In fact, prevalence of T2DM cases is becoming a worldwide threat. The incidence of this disease has alarmingly doubled over the last three decades 40. T2DM is initially preceded by insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia, both of which are related with cardiovascular risk factors such as obesity, hypertension, lipid abnormalities, and endothelial dysfunction 41. Consequently, when the heart loses the ability to pump blood effectively, congestive heart failure occurs which is often contributory to the later onset of AMI. Haffner et al. 42 discovered that the risk of adults with T2DM to suffer from CVD is two to four times higher than that of adults without the disorder.Between 2010 and 2030, the number of T2DM cases is projected to increase by 69% in developing countries and by 20% in developed countries 43. An upsurge projection of the number of T2DM adults in developing countries is strongly associated with adoption of Western lifestyle due to overconsumption of inexpensive, high-calorie food, and sedentary routine. The resulting potent obesity rapidly escalates the percentages of diabetic incidence in these developing nations which are already stricken under the burden of communicable diseases such as lower respiratory tract infections, acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), diarrheal diseases, and others 44. To date, practitioners in the U.S. have recommended diverse cardiac tests to diagnose coronary heart disease despite the limitation that no individual test is sufficiently reliable 45. The tests may incorporate electrocardiogram, stress testing, echocardiography, chest x-ray, blood tests, electron-beam computed tomography, coronary angiography, and cardiac catherization. Thus far, none of these tests are adequately relevant to the prediction of infarction in the majority of individuals tested, even if their biochemical results are also supplemented to foresee the cardiac event. Likewise, in developing countries, the lofty costs of highly-trained practicioners, hospitalizations, and these tests are inherently unfeasible 46. For this reason, prospective patients from these regions are more likely to forgo the testing process and leave themselves undetected until reaching the chronic stage. Due to the reliability and inexpensive nature of saliva collection, salivary diagnosis can be easily aimed at these high-risk patients residing in developing regions. Consequently, this method is expected to revamp the current health system and increase the availability of accurate diagnostics in remote and impoverished areas.In a proteomic research of salivary biomarkers, Rao et al. 47 identified 487 unique proteins correlated with T2DM of which 33% of these had not been previously reported in human saliva. Sixty-five proteins were markedly expressed between control and T2DM samples predominantly involved in regulating metabolism and immune response pathways. Even though extensive studies have been conducted by scientists around the globe pertaining to respective diseases of T2DM and AMI, it is still paramount for the practitioners to be able to predict the onset of AMI among T2DM patients due to its strong propensity. A review conducted by Syed Ikmal et al. suggested YKL-40, alpha-hydroxybutyrate, soluble CD36, leptin, resistin, interleukin-18, retinol binding protein-4, and chemerin, some of which may be present in saliva, could act as predictors of cardiovascular events in diabetic patients. 48. Practically, a T2DM patient diagnosed with an enhanced level of any clotting proteins or inflammatory markers in saliva should be regularly monitored for an early intervention prior to the onset of AMI. In future, the generated database of these biomarkers will provide an instructive reference to assess the susceptibility of T2DM patients to heart condition, hence reducing morbidity and mortality associated with AMI and improving the quality of life of the patients predominantly from developing nations.\nCurrent challenges\nSaliva diagnostic tests can be potentially used within a wide range of clinical applications including population-based screening programs, confirmatory diagnosis, risk stratification, prognosis determination, and therapy response monitoring. Nevertheless, decreasing the number of false-negative and false-positive test result outcomes should be invariably taken into consideration in order to maintain the quality of patient diagnosis and therapy 49.In certain cases, some salivary proteomes may be spuriously discovered as biomarkers within a large pool of samples. One reason is certain peptides may have been subjected to modifications resulting to polymorphic isoforms and post translational modifications 50. Numerous salivary proteins were revealed to exist in polymorphic forms. For instance, genetic polymorphisms in CA6 gene influence the expression and catalytic activity of human salivary carbonic anhydrase VI 51. Protein degradation in whole saliva also plays a role in the variety of peptides observed. Takehara and her co-workers 52 proposed that the N-terminal region of mucin 7 was particularly prone to proteolytic degradation due to varying biological states of the human body. Another study conducted by Sun et al. 53 proved that many salivary glycoproteins were associated with age, gender, and immunity. It is also noteworthy that even though passive drooling, paraffin gum, and Salivette&#174; collection methods cover whole saliva proteome, specific proteins observed are dependent on the collection approach 54.In addition, older age is often associated with a number of cases related to functional limitations, heart failure, prior coronary disease, and renal insufficiency 55. As a result, saliva collection can pose a challenge among older T2DM patients. For example, geriatric patients are prone to xerostomia upon medications with anticholinergic properties, dehydration, diabetes, and radiotherapy for head and neck cancer 56. Dry mouth will limit the amount of sample collected and compromise its subsequent results. Insufficient sample volume obtained will possibly resort to loss of patients during the study. Some alternative sample collection approaches have been evaluated such as passive drool, filter paper, and microsponges but each individual approach has its own advantages and disadvantages in terms of sufficient sample recovery 57. Since there is no concrete resolution, the researcher has to be able to decide the best technique in accordance to the nature of research. It is also important to keep in mind that upon saliva collection, subsequent centrifugation for removing precipitated mucins and cellular contaminants will eliminate some proteins of interest. Despite incorporating accurate choice of collection system for easy quantification of volume with ample sample recovery, other essential standardisations of some preanalytical variables should always include precise and standardised collection schedules corresponding to individual hydration state, body posture, lighting, smoking status, circadian and circannual cycles, medications, food and visual stimulation, size of salivary glands, body weight, salivary flow index, physical exercise, alcohol intake, systemic diseases, nutrition, nausea, age, gender, and prevention of sample contamination with blood from oral mucosa and periodontal lesions 58.Even though potential salivary biomarkers related to AMI were already discovered, other tests should be able to verify the presence of these proteins before its further applications. In clinical studies, biomarkers must be robust, distinguishable, and validated, particularly with regard to which biomarker is strongly linked to disease onset and progression. To achieve this goal, whole proteome-wide application and target biomarker discovery such as MS-based proteomics approaches will be able to provide an avenue due its higher sensitivity and accuracy in identifying and quantifying proteins than immunological assays 59.\nConclusions\nThere has been growing interest in diagnosis based on analysis of saliva due its simple and non-invasive collection procedure. Since saliva collection is inherently painless, practitioners will be able to diagnose and monitor the patients' wellbeing more frequently while approaching the sensitivity and specificity of a blood test. Plus, the collection is also cheap and safe for both the practitioner and patient. With that, patients especially from developing countries can be diagnosed with minimal costs but great precision.In summary, human salivary proteomes exhibit promising potential as biomarkers to predict the onset of AMI particularly among its high-risk group of T2DM. Comprehensive analysis of human salivary proteome through various methods is indeed necessary in order to find the most reproducible markers for later utility in acute cardiac care. It is projected that salivary diagnostics will be conclusive such that fewer diagnostic biomarkers can be determined with immediate results, thus greatly improving the life quality of patients. In the long run, more available saliva collection kits developed by manufacturing companies will be able to aid and eventually provide solid biomarker findings in future.", "pmid": "25897294", "title": "Can Saliva Proteins Be Used to Predict the Onset of Acute Myocardial Infarction among High-Risk Patients?", "journal_title": "International Journal of Medical Sciences", "authors": "Mohd Aizat Abdul Rahim;Zubaidah Haji Abdul Rahim;Wan Azman Wan Ahmad;Onn Haji Hashim", "doi": "10.7150/ijms.11280", "score": "0.0027306592"}, {"keywords": "genotype;HCV;IFN;interferon-stimulated genes;transcriptomics", "abstract": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) can be classified into seven distinct genotypes that are associated with differing pathologies and respond differently to antiviral therapy.

The virus has been classified into seven distinct genotypes, which are approximately 30% divergent at the nucleotide sequence level [1]. The genotypes segregate according to geographical distribution, with certain genotypes widely distributed across the globe. In the UK, genotypes 1 and 3 (gt1 and gt3, respectively) predominate and have approximately equivalent prevalence [2,3]. From a clinical point of view, the distribution of HCV genotypes is of great importance due to the distinctive clinical outcomes associated with gt1 or gt3 infection.The response to antiviral therapies is influenced by HCV genotype. Gt1 infections have a lower sustained virological response (SVR) rate when treated with combination pegylated interferon (IFN)&#945; and ribavirin (40&#8211;50% compared to 70&#8211;80% for gt3) [4,5]. This effect of HCV genotype on treatment outcome differs depending on the specific antiviral drugs employed. A recent phase III clinical trial of the pan-genotypic direct acting antiviral sofosbuvir identified a higher rate of relapse in gt3-infected patients, suggesting that gt3 HCV may be relatively more difficult to treat when using IFN-free regimes [6]. HCV also exerts genotype-specific effects on host cell lipid metabolism. Gt3 infections are associated with an increased prevalence of liver steatosis and reduced serum cholesterol concentration, both of which resolve following successful viral clearance [7&#8211;10]. These genotype-specific clinical manifestations are independent of known negative predictors of treatment response [5] and co-morbidities associated with liver steatosis [10].The genotype-specific decrease in peripheral serum cholesterol levels provides a potential mechanism through which HCV could modulate peripheral immune cells in a genotype-specific manner during chronic infection. Peripheral cholesterol levels are known to play an important role in regulating proinflammatory immune responses within immune cells [11,12]. This raises the possibility that gt3 HCV, by reducing peripheral cholesterol levels, also reduces the proinflammatory effects exerted by peripheral immune cells. Studies investigating the interaction between chronic HCV infection and peripheral blood immune cells have identified a proinflammatory signature associated with elevated interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) [13], as well as elevated expression of proinflammatory cytokines [14]. However, these studies have focussed exclusively on infection with gt1 HCV and fail to address potential genotype-specific peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) responses. In this study, we set out to explore distinctive transcriptional profiles induced by different HCV genotypes in PBMCs.\nMaterials and Methods\n\nClinical samples\nClinical samples were used with informed consent conforming to the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki and study protocols were approved by the West of Scotland Research Ethics Committee. Blood samples were obtained from a cohort of patients with chronic hepatitis C and healthy volunteers (Table1). Exclusion criteria included co-infection with other viruses (hepatitis B virus or HIV), non-HCV related liver disease, active antiviral therapy, metabolic disorders, medication affecting lipid metabolism, current intravenous drug use, chronic alcohol use and a body mass index (BMI) >30. Participants were assessed for HCV risk factors, HCV infection status (anti-HCV antibodies, viral load and virus genotype) and markers of hepatic inflammation/cirrhosis (alanine aminotransferase levels and transient elastography [FibroScan]). Participants were classified as having no/minimal fibrosis (FibroScan score 12.5&#160;kPa) [15]. Statistical significance was calculated using GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA).\nRNA extraction\nRNA was extracted from PBMCs following separation over a density gradient (Histopaque&#174;-1077; Sigma-Aldrich, Gillingham, UK). Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Minicolumns with on-column DNase-digestion (Qiagen, Manchester, UK) following manufacturer's guidelines. RNA quality and quantity were assessed by NanoDrop 1000 (Thermo Scientific) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and 2200 TapeStation (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) instruments.\nMicroarray analysis\nRNA (150&#160;ng) was hybridized onto modified Agilent 4&#160;&#215;&#160;44K microarrays containing 201 additional probes, corresponding to 119 genes previously not found on the array (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Raw data were extracted using Feature Extraction software (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA), and the generated text files were processed and analysed with ChipInspector (Genomatix Software, Munich, Germany). Differentially regulated genes were selected with a cut-off fold change of 2 (in either direction) and a signal intensity of >100 in one of the biological groups.\nClustering and gene-annotation enrichment analysis\nGene-annotation enrichment analysis was carried out with DAVID Bioinformatics Resource 6.7 [16], using the Agilent HumanGenomeCGH44K background gene set (for microarray data), and adjusting for multiple testing by the Benjamini&#8211;Hochberg procedure. Data were clustered in R using the log-transformed microarray signal values with the hclust package (utilizing agglomerative clustering) and visualized by heatmap.2 (from the gplots package).\nReverse transcription and quantitative real-time PCR (Q-PCR)\nTotal RNA was reverse transcribed with the SuperScript&#174; VILO&#8482; cDNA Synthesis kit (Life Technologies, Paisley, UK) according to manufacturer's instructions. Microarray results were validated by Q-PCR using TaqMan&#174; assays (Life Technologies, Paisley, UK; Table S1). HPRT1 was used as a reference gene, and data were analysed using the comparative threshold cycle method [17]. Statistical significance was calculated using the nonparametric Kruskal&#8211;Wallis test with Dunn's multiple comparison post-test using GraphPad Prism 5.\nResults\n\nGenotype-specific transcriptional changes are observed in known ISGs but not genes related to lipid metabolism\nTo investigate potential genotype-specific differences in PBMC transcription, we selected a subgroup of chronically infected patients (gt1 n&#160;=&#160;8 and gt3 n&#160;=&#160;8) who were matched by age, gender and had low FibroScan scores (to exclude any transcriptional changes associated with fibrosis or cirrhosis). We utilized Agilent 4&#160;&#215;&#160;44K microarrays modified to detect additional genes, involved in lipid metabolic processes that are absent in the original array. A total of 42 differentially expressed genes were identified; 37 were up-regulated in the gt1 samples and 5 were up-regulated in the gt3 samples (Fig.1 and Table S2). This small number of differentially expressed genes highlights the subtle difference between chronic infection with either HCV gt1 or gt3. Sample clustering on the basis of the log-transformed microarray signal values from these 42 differentially regulated genes failed to separate the different genotypes although a subgroup of gt1-infected samples did form a distinct cluster (Fig.1). This cluster was statistically significant when analysed by multiscale bootstrap resampling (data not shown). This implies that at least a proportion of patients infected with gt1 HCV are characterized by a distinct peripheral transcriptional profile.The majority of the differentially expressed genes are known ISGs and play important roles in pro-inflammatory immune responses to viral infections. The largest differential transcription was observed for interferon alpha-inducible protein 27 (IFI27; up-regulated 6.0-fold in HCV gt1 infection; Table S2). Sarasin-Filipowicz and colleagues previously identified genotype-specific transcription of IFI27 in liver biopsies [18]; however, reports are conflicting on whether IFI27 transcription is also up-regulated in PBMC samples from patients with chronic HCV infection [13,14]. No genes relating to lipid metabolism were identified as differentially expressed between HCV gt1 and gt3 infection, and only one gene related to lipid signalling was identified &#8211; free fatty acid receptor 2 (FFAR2; up-regulated 2.2-fold in HCV gt1 infection; Table S2), a G-protein-coupled receptor, expressed on leucocytes, that recognizes short-chain free fatty acids [19].\nEnrichment of immune-related pathways and Type I IFN-responsive genes in gt1-infected patients\nTo gain further functional understanding of these genotype-specific differences, we performed gene-annotation enrichment analysis. Significant enrichment of gene terms relating to antiviral pathways and innate immune responses were identified amongst the 42 differentially transcribed genes (Fig.2a). In particular, the gt1-infected patients demonstrated an enrichment of the immune response pathway, the inflammatory response pathway and the antiviral interferon-induced 56K protein family [20] (Fig.2a). Although decreased peripheral cholesterol levels were observed in the gt3-infected patients (Table1), no enrichment of lipid or cholesterol metabolic pathways was observed.To further analyse these differentially transcribed genes, we matched the ISGs to published gene sets generated following stimulation of PBMCs with Type I IFN, Type II IFN, interleukin (IL)12 or TNF&#945;, respectively [21]. The ISGs identified as having genotype-specific expression were all classified as being induced by Type I IFN, and genes induced exclusively by Type II IFN or TNF&#945; were absent (Fig.2b).\nPatients infected with HCV gt1 have elevated peripheral ISG transcription but comparable IFN transcription to gt3-infected patients\nTo validate the microarray findings, we selected three of the identified genotype-specific genes (interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1 (IFIT1), ISG15 ubiquitin-like modifier (ISG15) and radical S-adenosyl methionine domain containing 2 (RSAD2)) and analysed their expression by Q-PCR in the full cohort of patients chronically infected with either HCV gt1 (n&#160;=&#160;22) or gt3 (n&#160;=&#160;22). We also analysed a group of age- and gender-matched uninfected controls (n&#160;=&#160;15). The infected patients showed no significant differences in viral load, liver function tests or FibroScan scores. Gt3 infection was associated with significantly reduced serum cholesterol compared to the uninfected controls and gt1 infection, consistent with previous studies [7&#8211;10], as well as a significantly reduced platelet count compared to the uninfected controls (Table1).We detected a statistically significant increase in transcription of IFIT1,ISG15 and RSAD2 in gt1-infected patients compared to healthy controls, which was absent or reduced in gt3-infected patients (Fig.3). This elevated transcription of ISGs in gt1-infected patients (geometric mean fold change vs healthy controls: IFIT1&#160;=&#160;2.50, ISG15&#160;=&#160;2.55 and RSAD2&#160;=&#160;2.46) validates the microarray results and demonstrates an association between HCV gt1 and elevated transcription of pro-inflammatory ISGs in the periphery.To explore the possibility that elevated expression of IFNs in PBMCs induces the ISGs in chronically infected patients, we profiled the transcription of the Type I IFNs IFNA2 and IFNB1, the Type II IFN IFNG, and the Type III IFN IFNL2. No significant differences were observed in the transcription levels of any of the IFNs between the three groups (Fig.3). The transcription of both Type I and Type III IFNs were very low across all groups, and indeed transcription was undetectable in a number of samples, suggesting that IFNs are unlikely to be driving the elevated ISG transcription in gt1-infected patients.\nGenotype-specific transcriptional profiles are independent of previous treatment failure and unfavourable IL28B genotype\nPrevious studies have identified elevated ISG expression in the liver [18,22] and PBMCs [23] as predictors of response to IFN outcome. This elevated ISG expression is also associated with the unfavourable IL28B &#8216;CT&#8217; and &#8216;TT&#8217; genotypes [24]. We therefore sought to examine whether the differences we observed between gt1 and gt3 infections were simply due to differences in the number of individuals with previous treatment failure or in the balance of IL28B genotypes.The number of patients who had previously failed IFN-based therapy was larger in the gt1-infected group compared to the gt3-infected group (11 vs 4; P-value&#160;=&#160;0.055), as was expected based on the genotypic differences in treatment response rates. Despite this, the transcription levels of IFIT1,ISG15 and RSAD2 between previous treatment failures vs treatment na&#239;ve individuals were similar (Fig.4a). The gt1- and gt3-infected patient groups had similar proportions of individuals with favourable &#8216;CC&#8217; and unfavourable &#8216;CT/TT&#8217; genotypes (Table1). No differences in the transcription levels of IFIT1,ISG15 and RSAD2 were observed between individuals with favourable or unfavourable IL28B genotypes (Fig.4b). These results imply that HCV gt1 may influence peripheral immune cells and induce elevated ISG transcription independent of the described effects of treatment response phenotype or IL28B genotype.\nDiscussion\nProfiling the transcriptional changes in PBMCs associated with specific HCV genotypes illuminates genotype-specific host&#8211;pathogen interactions underlying the known clinical features of chronic HCV infection associated with particular genotypes. Using a group of age- and gender-matched patients, selected on the basis of low FibroScan scores to minimize any changes associated with fibrosis or cirrhosis, we identified distinct changes in ISG and immune-related gene transcription within PBMCs from patients infected with either HCV gt1 or gt3. Chronic infection with HCV gt1 was associated with elevated transcription of genes induced by Type I IFNs and involved in immune response and inflammatory response pathways.Our results confirm previous studies that have identified the presence of ongoing proinflammatory gene induction in PBMCs from patients with chronic HCV infection [13,14]. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that this proinflammatory induction is exaggerated in patients infected with HCV gt1. Importantly, the elevated transcription we observed is unrelated to differences in the proportion of individuals with &#8216;favourable&#8217; or &#8216;unfavourable&#8217; IL28B genotype or the proportion of patients who have previously failed IFN-based therapy, both of which are associated with elevated expression of ISGs [25].The ISGs identified in our study with elevated transcriptional in PBMCs from patients with gt1 infection include a number of genes that have previously been identified in transcriptomic studies of HCV-infected liver biopsies [18,22,25,26]. These studies compared liver transcriptomes between patients who achieved SVR with patients who failed to respond to IFN-based therapies and demonstrated that higher expression of ISGs is associated with poor response to therapy [18,22,25,26]. Indeed, pre-existing induction of ISGs predicts treatment response with greater accuracy than the widely used IL28B genotype [25]. While these studies failed to specifically address genotype-specific transcriptional changes within the liver, when treatment response was excluded, viral genotype had the next biggest influence on differential gene transcription [22].In the liver, the elevated transcription of ISGs includes a number of negative regulators of IFN&#945; signalling pathways, such as ubiquitin-specific peptidase 18 (USP18), which inhibits further IFN signalling and is thought to contribute to the lack of IFN&#945;-induced gene induction in treatment nonresponders [27,28]. Strong IFN responses have also been hypothesized to limit the development of robust T-cell immune responses during the establishment of chronic HCV infection [29]. Our results suggest that a general elevation of PBMC ISG transcription occurs in gt1-infected patients. This is in agreement with the conclusion by Sarasin-Filipowicz and colleagues that patients infected with HCV gt1 more frequently have increased expression of ISGs in the liver, which provides a plausible explanation for the relatively poor response to IFN-based therapies in these patients [18]. It is perhaps noteworthy that gt1 infection is associated with spontaneous viral clearance during acute infection [30]. The strong pro-inflammatory responses induced by HCV gt1 may aid clearance during early acute infection but hinder IFN signalling once chronic infection is established.Despite observing a significant level of hypocholesterolemia in gt3-infected patients, we did not observe changes in genes involved in lipid metabolism. While in vitro studies have identified alterations in metabolic gene expression induced by HCV gt3 proteins [31,32], our results demonstrate that such transcriptional changes are not apparent in PBMCs. It is possible that changes in lipid metabolism may only occur within liver hepatocytes despite systemic reduction in total cholesterol levels. Alternatively, genotype-specific differences in lipid metabolism may only be evident at a post-transcriptional level. Clark and colleagues have previously identified a gt3-specific decrease in the serum levels of metabolites involved in the late stages of cholesterol synthesis, which resolve upon successful response to therapy, indicating that HCV gt3 is able to directly perturb cholesterol biosynthesis at a post-transcriptional level [33].While the elevation of ISG transcription is evident in PBMC samples from gt1-infected patients, the mechanisms underlying this induction are not understood. A key question raised from our study is why gt1 and gt3 mediate different transcriptional responses? Although it is likely that reduced peripheral cholesterol levels act to reduce pro-inflammatory responses of peripheral immune cells, as described previously [11,12], this fails to explain potential genotype-specific differences observed in transcriptomic studies of the liver [18,22]. No differences in the transcription of Type I, II, or III IFNs were observed between any of the study groups, suggesting that alternative immune signalling pathways drive the induction of ISGs. Future studies should address whether gt1- or gt3-specific genetic sequences are responsible for driving elevated ISG transcription.In summary, our data are consistent with the hypothesis that gt1 infection drives a skewed Type I IFN response. These transcriptional differences may shed light on possible mechanisms underlying the distinctive clinical manifestations of these two HCV genotypes. Our study lays the foundation for further analysis of dysregulation of host cell factors by the distinct HCV genotypes.", "pmid": "25200131", "title": "Elevated interferon-stimulated gene transcription in peripheral blood mononuclear cells occurs in patients infected with genotype 1 but not genotype 3 hepatitis C virus", "journal_title": "Journal of Viral Hepatitis", "authors": "M W Robinson;R Swann;A Sigruener;S T Barclay;P R Mills;J McLauchlan;A H Patel", "doi": "10.1111/jvh.12310", "score": "0.0026472937"}, {"keywords": "Giant fibroadenoma;Pre-pubertal girl;Breast conservation surgery", "abstract": "Highlights\n&#8226;Virginal hypertrophy, giant fibroadenoma, and cystosarcoma phyllodes are the important differential diagnoses to be considered when one encounters a large breast mass in a young female patient.&#8226;Fibroadenoma 5&#160;cm or more in diameter is considered as giant fibroadenoma.

They are termed giant when they attain a size more than 5&#160;cm or are disproportionately larger than normal breast. Giant fibroadenomas may present as a clinical problem to treating surgeons as they may show rapid growth and skin changes thus mimicking carcinoma. Giant fibroadenomas are extremely rare in pre-pubertal girls. Through this case report we want to highlight the clinical approach and management of giant fibroadenoma in pre-pubertal girls. We are reporting our work in line with the CARE criteria [1].\nCase presentation\nA 10 years old girl presented with rapidly enlarging left breast for 1 year duration without any history of pain, trauma, fever, anorexia and weight loss. She has not attained her menarche and there was no significant family history.On clinical examination (Fig. 1) 20&#160;cm&#160;&#215;&#160;20&#160;cm well-circumscribed, firm, non-tender and mobile lump was palpable in left breast with right breast being normal. The lump was not fixed to skin or underlying muscle. The overlying skin was tense and shiny with prominent superficial veins. There was no discharge from the nipple, and axillary lymph-adenopathy was absent.Routine hematological and biochemical examinations were within normal limits. We particularly wanted to see if ESR was raised as tuberculosis was one of the differential diagnosis. Chest X-ray was normal. Ultrasonography of breast showed heterogenous parenchymal pattern suggestive of left breast fibroadenoma. The patient was subjected to fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of the breast lump with pathology suggesting fibroadenoma.Surgical excision of left breast lump with preservation of normal breast tissue, skin and nipple-areola complex was carried out. The specimen was sent for histopathological examination which showed well encapsulated tumor with hyperplasia of both epithelial and stromal components. The glands were lined by bilayered epithelium with pericanalicular pattern of fibroadenoma and absence of cytological atypia. The final histopathological diagnosis of Giant Juvenile Fibroadenoma of breast was given (Fig. 2).Surgical excision with breast conservation resulted in very good cosmesis and patient satisfaction. She is in regular follow-up after 6 months of surgery and doing well.\nDiscussion\nGiant fibroadenoma is defined as a tumor >5&#160;cm in diameter or disproportionally large compared to the rest of the breast. They are classified as either adult or juvenile type, latter being rare [2], [3]. The exact etiology of pathogenesis of giant fibroadenomas is still not understood completely. Major contributing factor is thought to be hormonal influence on adolescent breast [3]. Excessive estrogen stimulation and/or receptor sensitivity or reduced levels of estrogen antagonist during puberty have been implicated [3], [4].When a pre-pubertal girl presents with a breast lump, possibility of phyllodes tumor, virginal hypertrophy and adenocarcinoma should always be kept in mind. In tropical countries, Tuberculosis of the breast is an important differential for a breast lump. Ultrasonography of the breast with axilla and fine needle aspiration cytology are the two key diagnostic modalities available for evaluation of breast lump in this age group. Treatment modalities and the prognosis differ quite significantly in these various conditions. Some of the lesions are treated by mastectomy, but some lesions may require only local excision, aspiration, or conservative management [4], [5], [6].A giant fibroadenoma should be excised as its increasing size may distort the shape of breast. A submammary incision is preferred to provide good cosmesis. Recurrences after excision are reported in literature but are not common [7], [8].Isolated case reports of unilateral juvenile fibroadenoma and multiple giant fibroadenoma in single breast are available [3], [6], [8], [9]. Fortunately, complete excision with excellent cosmesis is possible in majority of these tumors, as was done in our patient.\nConclusion\nVirginal hypertrophy, giant fibroadenoma, and cystosarcoma phyllodes are the important differential diagnoses to be considered when one encounters a large breast mass in a young female patient. Counselling of the patient and the parents are key to the management of this pathology along with avoidance of missing any rare malignant pathology.\nConflict of interest\nAuthors declare no conflict of interest.\nSource of funding\nNo external funding source.\nEthical approval\nCase report so ethical clearnace not obtained.\nConsent\nWritten consent obtained from father of patient for use of data for publication purpose.\nAuthor contribution\n1.Kumar Gaurav&#8212;Operating surgeon, study concept and design.2.Gautam Chandra&#8212;Operating surgeon, study concept and design.3.Kumari Neelam&#8212;Data collection, data analysis, proof reading.4.Sanjeet kumar&#8212;Data collection, analysis, proof reading.5.Harish Singla&#8212;Study concept and design, writing the paper.6.Sanjay Kumar Yadav&#8212;Data interpretation, writing the paper", "pmid": "26433926", "title": "A pre-pubertal girl with giant juvenile fibroadenoma: A rare case report", "journal_title": "International Journal of Surgery Case Reports", "authors": "Kumar Gaurav;Gautam Chandra;Kumari Neelam;Sanjeet Kumar;Harish Singla;Sanjay Kumar Yadav", "doi": "10.1016/j.ijscr.2015.09.026", "score": "0.002504861"}, {"keywords": "One Health;Toxoplasmosis;History", "abstract": "Toxoplasmosis is paradigmatic of the One Health approach, as the causative parasite Toxoplasma gondii infects virtually all warm-blooded animals, including humans.

This collection of papers highlights state-of-the-art knowledge, gaps in knowledge and future perspectives, as well as the benefits of current and proposed future activities to tackle toxoplasmosis within the One Health context.", "body": "Conflict of interest statement\nThe authors declare they have no conflicts of interest whatsoever.", "pmid": "32095624", "title": "Toxoplasmosis: Overview from a One Health perspective", "journal_title": "Food and Waterborne Parasitology", "authors": "Olgica Djurkovi\u0107-Djakovi\u0107;Jean Dupouy-Camet;Joke Van der Giessen;Jitender P.

In 2005, healthcare spending totaled US$2.0 trillion&#8212;16% of the gross domestic product (GDP) (Poisal et al 2007). Further, healthcare spending is projected to account for 18.4% of GDP by 2013, when more than one out of every four dollars of personal consumption will be spent on healthcare (Heffler et al 2004).The aging of Americans is a central component fueling cost increases. In the year 2000, 12.4% of Americans were over age 65, but this will increase to 19.6% in 2030 (Goulding et al 2003). Chronic diseases, especially prevalent in the senior population, generate a large proportion of Medicare spending. In 1995&#8211;1999 (the most recent data), only 5% of Medicare beneficiaries, presumably many with chronic diseases, accounted for almost half (47%) of total spending. A much larger segment of the population (40%), those in relatively good health, accounted for only 1% of the total (Liberman et al 2003).Preventing or postponing the onset of chronic disease among seniors has become a crucial public health issue, as has the potential to compress the period of morbidity prior to death (Vita et al 1998). It has been estimated that approximately 70% of the total burden of disease (as measured in terms of premature deaths and potential years of life lost) can be traced back to illnesses that are preventable (Department of Health and Human Services 1991).Particularly noteworthy is research by McGinnis and Foege (1993) and Mokdad and colleagues (2004) who concluded that about half of all deaths in the US are caused by modifiable risk factors. Although death is inevitable, it is now becoming clear that successful health promotion programs can improve health, prevent much disability, delay mortality, and thereby substantially improve the quality of seniors&#8217; lives (Aldana 2001; Chernoff 2001).The growing awareness of the value of prevention and health promotion is evident at the executive branch of government. The President launched the HealthierUS initiative, promoting healthier lifestyles and a reduction of risk factors such as inactivity, obesity, and smoking (HealthierUS 2003). The rationale for this initiative, especially in relation to health promotion efforts directed at seniors, is described on the White House website:\n&#8220;Poor health should not be a foregone consequence of aging. Improvements in diet and physical activity can greatly improve the quality of life at any age. Regular physical activity also helps older Americans maintain joint strength and mobility and substantially delays the onset of functional limitations and loss of independence.&#8221; (White House 2003).The rapidly rising cost of healthcare, an aging population, and the high prevalence of chronic disease among the elderly generate a sense of urgency for finding innovative solutions to this country&#8217;s healthcare crisis, including health promotion and disease prevention initiatives. In this paper, we highlight several key studies that underscore the value of introducing health promotion and risk reduction programs directed at seniors. Furthermore, we present evidence suggesting that health promotion and risk reduction programs may reduce unnecessary healthcare utilization and related expenditures for the Medicare program, yielding a favorable return-on-investment (ROI) for such interventions. We finish our discussion with a description of an innovative demonstration project that Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) will be introducing in 2007 to test whether health promotion programs can improve the health of seniors and also achieve a positive cost-benefit ratio.\nThe value of health promotion and risk reduction programs for seniors\nA growing literature presents convincing evidence that seniors who reduce their modifiable health risks can forestall disability, reduce their utilization of health services, and ultimately save Medicare money (Hickey et al 1997; King et al 1998; Vita et al 1998; Fries 2002; Omenn 2003). Lubitz and colleagues (2003) presented evidence that elderly persons in better health at age 70 live about 2.7 years longer than those in poor health, and their cumulative Medicare healthcare expenditures are no greater than those who die earlier; in fact, they may be slightly lower. The MacArthur Study on Aging, consisting of dozens of studies conducted over a decade, helped researchers identify components of successful aging (Seeman et al 2001). For example, quitting smoking and initiating other lifestyle changes even later in life have produced substantial health benefits (Hickey et al 1997; Hermanson et al 1988).Importantly, several studies confirm the value of physical activity for improving health among the elderly (King 2001). Physical activity can extend life, help prevent heart disease and colon cancer, (Christmas and Andersen 2001; Penedo et al 2004) mitigate the effects of chronic diseases such as arthritis or diabetes (Christmas and Andersen 2001; Bean et al 2004), improve coordination and flexibility to help avoid falls (Christmas and Andersen 2001; Bean et al 2004), and alleviate depression among older adults (Christmas and Andersen 2001). Adults who practice even simple physical activity can improve their health status and use fewer health and social services (Aldana 2001). To emphasize the importance of physical activity, a comprehensive review by Himes (2002) identified these two overriding determinants of health status for seniors: social isolation as a strongly negative influence and regular physical activity as a strongly positive factor.\nCan seniors\u2019 health behaviors be changed?\nIn the private sector, evidence suggests that multicomponent health promotion and risk reduction programs can permanently change lifestyle habits and reduce population health risks for nonseniors (Heaney and Goetzel 1997). The same is found in seniors. A report by RAND (2001) concluded that successful risk reduction programs directed at working and senior populations share certain characteristics that make them effective in changing life-long health habits. Successful programs are anchored in behavior change theory, employ tailored and personalized interventions, are sufficiently intensive, and are complemented by adequate social supports. Such programs appear to work effectively even if they are not delivered face-to-face, but instead provided by telephone, internet, and mail. In addition, health promotion programs that engage participants in self-care activities and increase their involvement in healthcare decision-making can achieve long-term behavior change and risk reductions (Heaney and Goetzel 1997).Although much of this private sector research has been conducted with those under age 65, the underlying principles and methods employed by these programs possess sufficient flexibility to be tailored to the unique needs of diverse populations, suggesting that risk reduction programs targeting seniors have a high potential to achieve lasting behavior changes and potentially lower utilization of healthcare services (RAND 2001).\nThe potential for cost savings\nOther research in the private sector is pointing in the direction that evidence-based health promotion and risk reduction programs can save money. Several literature reviews that weighed the evidence from experimental and quasi-experimental research studies suggest that programs grounded in behavior change theory and that utilize tailored communications and individualized counseling for high-risk individuals produce a positive ROI (Goetzel et al 1999; Aldana 2001; US Department of Health and Human Services 2003). Much of the ROI research has emerged from employer-sponsored health promotion programs directed at active employees (Goetzel et al 1999; Pelletier 2001). In a review of 32 health promotion program evaluations, Aldana (2001) found 28 studies that reported medical cost savings. Of the seven studies that calculated cost-benefit ratios, financial returns averaged $3.48 for every dollar expended. Studies often cited with the strongest research designs and large numbers of subjects included those performed at Johnson and Johnson (Bly et al 1986; Breslow et al 1994), Citibank (Ozminkowski et al 1999), Dupont (Bertera 1990), the Bank of America (Leigh et al 1992; Fries et al 1993), Tenneco (Baun et al 1986), Duke University (Knight et al 1994), the California Public Employee Retirees System (CalPERS) (Fries et al 1994), Procter and Gamble (Goetzel, Jacobsen, et al 1998), and Chevron Corporation (Goetzel, Dunn, et al 1998). Even accounting for certain inconsistencies in design and results, most produced positive cost outcomes.The most recent review on this topic conducted by Chapman (2003), summarizing the results from 42 qualifying financial impact studies conducted over the past two decades, concluded that worksite programs achieve a 25%&#8211;30% reduction in medical and absenteeism costs in an average period of about 3.6 years (Goetzel, Jacobsen, et al 1998). Similarly, the RAND report (2001) concluded that health promotion and risk reduction programs using health risk assessments (HRAs) and ongoing tailored interventions have the potential to be cost-beneficial.Five financial analyses are especially pertinent to cost-benefit calculations for Medicare enrollees engaged in health promotion programs: Four (Fries et al 1993; Fries et al 1994; Fries and McShane 1998; Ozminkowski et al 2006) focused on risk reduction programs for seniors (at the Bank of America, CalPERS, and at General Motors Corporation), and one for working-age individuals at Citibank (Ozminkowski et al 1999). Employing available medical claims data to estimate changes in medical expenditures, the Citibank study reported an ROI of $4.70 to $1.00. That ROI estimate was similar to one obtained in a randomized trial using the same intervention program in a different population (Fries et al 1993). Using methods that imputed changes in medical expenditures from changes in utilization, the evaluations of Bank of America and CalPERS programs for seniors reported ROIs of approximately $5.00 to $1.00. The General Motors study was not an ROI study, because it contained no program cost information. However, it did demonstrate that health promotion programs offered to seniors, particularly those that are based upon administering a health risk appraisal, can save $101 to $648 per person per year (at the US dollar value for 2006), depending upon who participates and how many programs they use.Admittedly, the methodological rigor of evaluations performed at many corporate health promotion programs has not been consistent. In fact, randomized trials are hard to find in the literature, largely because they are not well accepted in a business environment. However, methodological shortcomings in earlier analyses have diminished significantly over the past two decades. The most recent evaluations using sophisticated econometric methods that control for selection bias do assess impact over several years (with some extending for three to five years and one, performed at Johnson & Johnson, lasting nine years) (Ozminkowski et al 2002). These advances should inform future study designs of similar health promotion interventions directed at seniors.In short, a focus on prevention and health promotion offers a most promising approach to the urgent challenges that the Medicare program faces today and into the future. Research in the private sector presents compelling evidence to warrant large scale federally funded demonstrations that test the prospect for well-designed health promotion and risk reduction efforts to pay for themselves through lower healthcare expenditures. Although some corporate studies have recently begun to focus on productivity impacts from these programs (eg, reduced absenteeism, shortened disability periods, decreased &#8220;presenteeism&#8221;), much of the private sector research has emphasized healthcare cost savings. This is the same focus of policy makers and legislators with oversight responsibility for Medicare.\nMedicare policy implications\u2014initiation of a senior risk reduction demonstration\nThere are still several unanswered questions related to the application of health promotion and risk reduction programs in an elderly population. For example, will living a healthy life truly reduce seniors&#8217; illnesses and incidence of disability prior to their demise or will they simply live longer and their illnesses and disability be delayed? Thus, will a longer life span cost Medicare more because seniors are alive longer and may still experience significant end-of-life illness and costs? These are testable hypotheses.While successful health promotion interventions could extend the period of healthy life and result in costs being incurred to the Medicare program over a longer period of time, the alternatives are not appealing. The obesity epidemic striking all populations has serious implications for Medicare. Researchers at RAND recently estimated the costs of the future obese elderly, and found that Medicare will spend 35% more caring for an obese 70-year-old person over his or her lifetime than for a normal weight person, at a cost of $36,000 (Lakdawalla et al 2005).To explore these very complex issues, in 2007, Medicare will initiate a three and a half year research project entitled Senior Risk Reduction Demonstration (SRRD), to test the health and economic impacts of providing health promotion services, modeled after programs provided to those under age 65. The SRRD will provide insights on how to deliver such programs practically, an important step in advancing the Medicare program from one focused on the diseases of older people to one focused on improving their health and quality of life.SRRD will operate under the following parameters:\nTarget population. CMS will offer risk reduction services to noninstitutionalized Medicare beneficiaries between the ages of 67 and 74, to be delivered by private sector vendors. Five vendors will be given contact information for a random sample of beneficiaries from across the US, as well as from communities that have exemplary Information and Referral/Assistance (I&R/A) programs for seniors.Voluntary participation. Beneficiaries will enroll in and complete the program voluntarily. Incentives will be offered to induce high participation and retention rates, but participation will be at the discretion of the beneficiary.Focus on self-care. The SRRD will emphasize health improvement and risk reduction to complement the clinical aspects of medical services that are offered by other healthcare professionals. The program will contain elements of chronic disease self-management that take the form of patient education, advice, and counseling but will be primarily targeted at seniors who are well and do not need disease management services.Tailoring to beneficiaries. Vendor programs will be tailored to the needs, concerns, and learning styles of seniors. The goal is to develop personalized materials and instruments, followed by interventions tailored to the risks presented by the participants.Central coordination. Programs will be centrally coordinated and administered by CMS through its vendors. Programs will deliver interventions via the mail, internet, and/or telephone counseling and coaching.Referral to local community resources. Vendors will be required to refer beneficiaries to national or local community resources. For beneficiaries residing in preselected exemplary I&R/A communities, vendors will be required to make referrals to the local I&R/A organizations.Multiple behavior change modules. Programs will address several modifiable health risk categories simultaneously in the assessment, triage, and follow-up phases of the intervention. Risk factors addressed in the SRRD include the following: 1) physical inactivity/lack of exercise; 2) poor nutrition; 3) smoking/tobacco use; 4) excessive alcohol consumption; 5) high blood pressure; 6) high blood glucose; 7) high total cholesterol; 8) being overweight/obese; 9) inappropriate use of clinical preventive services; 10) depression; 11) high stress; 12) lack of general well-being; 13) burden of providing care giving; 14) social isolation; 15) lack of motor vehicle/home safety; 16) falls (preventable accidents); and 17) polypharmacy/medication issues.The SRRD will be judged on its ability to achieve high enrollment, participation, and retention rates; improve beneficiaries&#8217; health, health risks, and functionality; and achieve a positive ROI for the Medicare program. Readers interested in learning more about the SRRD are invited to visit CMS&#8217; website (CMS 2006).\nConclusion\nThis Administration&#8217;s interest in prevention, combined with the impending insolvency of the Medicare Trust Fund, make it timely for CMS to explore and test evidence-based approaches to risk reduction and health promotion that may not only help beneficiaries to take better care of themselves, but that are likely to generate a positive ROI. The SRRD will provide insights on how to deliver such programs practically, an important step in advancing the Medicare program from one focused on the diseases of older people to one focused on improving their health and quality of life. In short, a focus on prevention and health promotion offers a most promising approach to the urgent challenges that the Medicare program faces today and into the future.", "pmid": "18044084", "title": "Can health promotion programs save Medicare money?", "authors": "Ron Z Goetzel;David Shechter;Ronald J Ozminkowski;David C Stapleton;Pauline J Lapin;J Michael McGinnis;Catherine R Gordon;Lester Breslow", "score": "0.0016397305"}, {"keywords": "", "abstract": "Background\nCurrently, there is no consensus opinion regarding the optimal procedure of choice in super-super-morbid obesity (Body mass index, BMI > 60 kg/m2).

Moreover, besides improving the results of total weight loss, a gradual filling of the band can as well prevent the RYGB patient from weight regain if restriction would fade away with time.", "body": "Background\nCurrently, there is no consensus opinion regarding the surgical procedure of choice in super-super morbid obesity (Body mass index, BMI > 60 kg/m2). Following a debate during the 2005 annual meeting of the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES), surgeons choose laparoscopic gastric bypass as the procedure of choice in a hypothetical super-super obese patient case scenario [1]. Unfortunately, there is very little published data examining and comparing the outcomes in super-super obese patients with any of the well known bariatric procedures.Since its first description in open surgery in 1966 [2] and by laparoscopy in 1994 [3], Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) has become one of the most popular surgical procedures for morbid obesity [4]. In spite of higher risk and technical challenges, laparoscopic RYGBP (LRYGBP) can be safely performed in the super-super-obese [5-7]. Unfortunately, RYGB is associated with failure to achieve or maintain 50% excess weight loss (EWL) or BMI  35) following RYGB surgery in the super-super obese group [7,11].In the case of poor weight loss or weight regain, surgical alternatives reported in the literature include conversion to a distal bypass [12,13] or BPD/DS [14]. Dapri et al has reported laparoscopic placement of a non-adjustable silicone ring in six patients for weight regain after RYGB with good results [15]. Recently, the addition of adjustable gastric band (AGB) around the gastric pouch either by laparoscopy [16,17] or by open access [18] has also been reported as a revisional procedure. However, revisional bariatric procedures are technically more complex and associated with increased postoperative complications [9,10,19].Following encouraging results with adjustable gastric band as a revisional procedure [15-17] in patients with weight regain or poor initial weight loss after RYGB, we performed a combined procedure of laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass as a primary operation for the super-super obese patient as described below.\nMethods\n\nPatients\nBetween November 2009 and March 2010, 6 consecutive super-super-obese patients (4 women and 2 men; mean age 40.5 years; range 21-48 years) underwent a primary laparoscopic adjustable banded Roux-en-Y gastric bypass procedure at our institution. Mean BMI at the time of operation was 70.7 kg/m2 (range 69-73.9 kg/m2). Prior to surgery all patients followed a high protein diet for at least two weeks in order to achieve a reduction in visceral adipose tissue and liver volume [20]. All the patients were provided with information regarding the operation itself and possible complications. The patients consented with knowledge of routine postoperative complications and specific warning of band slippage, migration, and band or port infection. The first follow-up visit is scheduled for after 6 weeks. Thereafter, visits are planned 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively.\nSurgical technique\nOne dose of cefazoline 1 g was given IV at induction of general anaesthesia. The patients were placed in the supine position, split-leg with reverse Trendelenberg position along with slight flexion of the hip to help increase surgical abdominal workspace [21]. The surgeon stood between the legs. A video monitor is positioned at the level of the patient's head. A 30&#176; angle scope is used. Abdominal insufflation with carbon dioxide (CO2) is achieved using a Veress needle. Intra-abdominal pressures are maintained at 15 to 17 mmHg. A five-port technique was employed: a 10 mm port 10-15 cm below the xiphoid process, a 5 mm port high epigastric on the midline, a 12 mm port in the right upper quadrant and a 15 mm and 12 mm port in the left upper quadrant. The latter two ports are placed on the same line of the 10 mm port with the 15 mm port in the middle between the 10 mm and the 12 mm port. The former 12 mm port is placed somewhat higher above the same line (sub costal). Since we perform a standardized fully stapled laparoscopic RYGB procedure, the procedure started with the creation of the gastric pouch following the same principles as previously published by our group [22]. After creation of the gastric pouch, an atraumatic grasper was passed through a small opening between the blood vessels on the lesser curve and the gastric pouch 1-2 cm above the horizontal cut edge of the pouch. Following this step, an AGB was introduced via the 15 mm port, drawn around the pouch and locked into place (Figure 1). In the first four patients, a Heliogast&#174; HAGE band (Helioscopie, France) has been placed. The last two patients received a newer type of band, the Heliogast&#174; HAGB band (Helioscopie, France), which is easier to fit because of its lesser diameter and width (Figure 2).The remaining part of the operation was completed as described [22]. Since all patients had a BMI > 50 kg/m2, the length of the alimentary limb was measured at 200 cm. To prevent slippage, the band was then fixed by suturing the gastric remnant to the gastric pouch both above and below the band with nonabsorbable sutures (2/0 Ethibond, Ethicon). The subcutaneous reservoir port was secured to the anterior rectus sheath in a midclavicular plane and the tubing of the band connected to the port. The band was not filled at the operation.\nResults\nMean operative time was 75 minutes (range 64-121 min); no conversions were performed. Mean hospital stay was 3.3 days. All patients were allowed fluids from the second postoperative day.One male patient (21 years, BMI 70 kg/m2) developed a pneumonia postoperatively. He was given intravenous antibiotics along with intensive chest physiotherapy and was discharged home on the fifth postoperative day.No other postoperative complications were observed. There was no mortality in the group. There were no band or port-related infections and all patients were doing extremely well at their first follow-up visit in the outpatient policlinic six weeks after the operation.\nDiscussion\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first series of patients that underwent a laparoscopic adjustable gastric banded Roux-en-Y gastric bypass as a primary operation for the super-super obese in the indexed literature.Prosthetic devices have been used in bariatric operations to control the outlet of the gastric pouch and thus induce restriction to help maintain weight loss. Initial devices commonly employed in vertical banded gastroplasties (VBG) included a fixed diameter silastic ring or even mesh prostheses. In 1991 the group of Capella was the first to describe the vertical banded gastroplasty-gastric bypass with a 5.5 cm supporting band around a small gastric pouch [23]. In that same year, Fobi et al published their results with the silastic ring vertical banded gastric bypass [24]. Although producing effective restriction, the non adjustability of these devices has led to problems that have been reported in several series. Salinas et al have reported the results on a series of 1588 patients following various modifications of the silastic ring vertical bypass. They report stricture rates up to 3.8% in one of their subgroups, and the necessity of ring removal in 5.7% of the total population [25]. In a study comparing two silastic ring sizes, Cramtpon and colleagues report eating problems in 28% of patients requiring removal in 14% of patients with a 5.5 cm diameter ring, and in 4% of patients with a 6 cm ring [26,27]. The latter finding provides support for the superiority of a variable diameter system allowing adjustment for patient tolerance [26]. Interestingly, Kyzer et al report good results following the use of AGB in a subgroup of 22 patients that previously had silastic ring gastroplasties [28]. There are similar small series following the conversion of a non adjustable band to an adjustable system [29]. The adjustability of the device should, at least theoretically, counteract the possible complications associated with the non-adjustable ring. In a long-term follow-up study comparing VBG to AGB, Miller et al demonstrated a statistically significant lower re-intervention and re-operation rate and an improved health status and quality of life for the AGB group [30].There are reports of using an AGB with RYGB where the bands were placed below the gastro-jejunostomy to form the gastric pouch [31,32]. However, these operations had a high incidence of band erosions into the stomach and the small bowel. In an expert meeting on the adjustable banded gastric bypass at the 3rd annual meeting of the Italian Collaborative Study Group for the Lap-Band (2003), it was concluded that the combination of gastric bypass with an AGB to form the pouch is not recommended [33]. Steffen et al has also reported use of an adjustable gastric band with a distal gastric bypass and the stomach in their technique was divided horizontally and very low leaving a huge gastric pouch [34]. Our technique however is completely different to these variations as described above.With the combined procedure, a sequential action mechanism for EWL is to be expected. The EWL with RYGB will be effective at the beginning reaching a plateau after 12 - 18 months. The filling of the band at this time will result in further adjustable gastric pouch restriction thereby causing further weight loss. Also, the adjustable band will limit the volume of food intake, especially when restriction fades with time and weight regain would occur. The procedure thus combines the potential benefits of RYGBP and an AGB.We already described our technique of the laparoscopic adjustable banded sleeve gastrectomy in one patient without any device-related perioperative complications [35]. Especially in the RYGB procedure, one may be concerned about possible band or port infection since, in contrast to the sleeve gastrectomy, both the gastric pouch and the small bowel are opened during the operation. Apart from the cefazoline given at induction, we did not take any special measures to avoid band contamination. One should of course try to limit excessive spillage of gastric or small bowel content during the operation by carefully opening the pouch or the bowel assisted by appropriate suction.The AGB, however, has been associated with late complications, including slippage and erosion of the band. Since the band is placed through a small opening between the blood vessels immediately adjacent to the stomach and the lesser curve and fixed laterally with the gastric remnant both above and below the band, the chance of slippage is expected to be low. Whether or not late complications will occur remains to be seen.\nConclusion\nThe insertion of an AGB is feasible and seems to be safe during a LRYGB at the primary operation, with no immediate major complications. We assume that combining an adjustable band to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass will lead to better excess weight loss results than those of a gastric bypass alone. It is hoped that this combined procedure will be most useful in the super-super obese (Body mass index > 60 kg/m2) patients. More patients with a long-term follow-up are necessary to provide definitive conclusions regarding long-term benefits and complications of this combined bariatric procedure.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors' contributions\nStudy conception and design: BD; Drafting of manuscript: BD, SVC, SA; Acquisition of data: EVD, SVC; Analysis and interpretation of data: EVD, SVC; Critical revision: BD, SVC, JPM.All authors read and approved the final manuscript.\nPre-publication history\nThe pre-publication history for this paper can be accessed here:http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2482/10/33/prepub", "pmid": "21073750", "title": "Laparoscopic adjustable banded roux-en-y gastric bypass as a primary procedure for the super-super-obese (body mass index > 60 kg/m2)", "journal_title": "BMC Surgery", "authors": "Bruno Dillemans;Sebastiaan Van Cauwenberge;Sanjay Agrawal;Els Van Dessel;Jan-Paul Mulier", "doi": "10.1186/1471-2482-10-33", "score": "0.0015482487"}, {"keywords": "", "abstract": "Hot days in summer (involving a few hours at particularly high temperatures) are expected to become more common under climate change.

Firstly, eggs were divided into six groups and each group was reared to different development stages at 25&#8201;&#177;&#8201;1&#8201;&#176;C, 60&#8211;80% RH and 15L: 9D. For each stage, individuals were randomly assigned to six temperature treatments (40&#8201;&#176;C for 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 or 24&#8201;hrs with 60&#8211;80% RH) or 25&#8201;&#176;C in a climate chamber. Each temperature treatment involved 3 replications (eggs) or 4 replications (other stages). For each replication, we used 19&#8211;51 eggs (&#8804;18&#8201;hrs old), 20&#8211;65 1st-instar larvae (newly hatched larvae,&#8804;6&#8201;hrs old), 20&#8211;30 3rd-instar larvae (newly molt, &#8804;12&#8201;hrs old), 20&#8211;30 pupae (newly pupation,&#8804;12&#8201;hrs old) or 10&#8211;20 females or males (newly emerged, &#8804;12&#8201;hrs old).During heat stress, individuals were maintained in a Petri dish (9&#8201;cm diameter), and supplied with fresh artificial food (Southland Products Incorporated, USA) in the case of the larval treatment. Newly emerged females or males were stressed singly in a Petri dish (6&#8201;cm diameter). After heat stress, all individuals tested were removed to 25&#8201;&#176;C for further rearing. Food was renewed every 3 days to assure that development and growth was not food limited. Once Plutella eclosed, a total of 16 surviving males and females from a given temperature treatment were paired, or all pairs were used if there were fewer survivors than 16 pairs. Adults were allowed to oviposit in a Petri dish (9&#8201;cm diameter), and held at 25&#8201;&#176;C, 60&#8211;80% RH and 15L: 9D. Adults received a piece of fresh cabbage leaf (4&#8201;&#215;&#8201;2&#8201;cm) for egg laying. Fresh cabbage leaves and Petri dishes were renewed every day. Temperature and humidity in the chamber were monitored (Taiwan Hengxin AZ Co., AZ-8829, Taizhong, China Taiwan); temperature variation for all treatments was within &#177;1&#8201;&#176;C.\nMeasurements\nAfter heat stress, hatching status of eggs was checked (with a stereo microscope) twice daily at 08:00 and 20:00. For larva treatments, 1st-instar or 3rd-instar larval survival was checked after recovery at 25&#8201;&#176;C for 24&#8201;hrs following the stress. Larvae were considered dead if their body did not move after touching them with a brush. The survivors of 1st-instar or 3rd-instar larvae after heat treatments continued to be observed daily at 08:00&#8201;am until all adults emerged. In pupal treatments, stressed pupae were checked twice daily until all adults emerged or pupae died (based on lack of adult emergence). For adult treatments, adult survival was checked 24&#8201;hrs after they were stressed. After pairing, we counted egg numbers (laid on the leaf and inner surface of the dish) daily across the first 7 days.\nStatistical analysis\nAll analyses were run with SAS V9.2. We compared immediate survival after heat stress between different development stages. For 1st-instar larvae, 3rd-instar larvae and adults, immediate survival was defined as the survival rate measured following a recovery at 25&#8201;&#176;C for 24&#8201;hrs after heat stress. For eggs and pupae, immediate survival was measured as egg hatching success and pupal emergence rate when these stages were returned to 25&#8201;&#176;C after heat stress. The relative impact of heat exposure of 40&#8201;&#176;C at the different stages was assessed through the exposure time for 50% mortality (LT50 in hrs) to be observed. LT50 was estimated by fitting time&#8211;mortality data to logit models. LT50 values between the stage treatments were compared by examining their 95% confidence intervals. If the limits overlapped, lethal times were not considered to differ significantly25.We explored the effect of heat exposures on subsequent survival (maturation success) after egg, 1st- or 3rd-instar larval heat stress. For egg treatments, maturation success was defined as the proportion of emerged adults from hatched eggs. For the 1st-instar or 3rd-instar larval treatment, maturation success was measured as the proportion of emerged adults from 1st- or 3rd-instars surviving after heat treatment. To compare treatments, we ran ANOVAs on survival data (with the proportion survival of each replicate group of eggs and larvae treated as data points). This was followed by post hoc Tukey B tests to determine which means differed significantly.Adult egg production was determined as the total number of eggs laid across 7 days. Because egg production of the controls for the different developmental stages did not differ significantly, we compared heat treatments to a pooled set of controls. For each developmental stage, the relationship between exposure time and adult egg production was analyzed by fitting a linear regression model. We compared the slopes and intercepts of the regression lines by one-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)26. To further test the stage-specific heat effect on adult egg production, we compared the difference of adult egg production between different stage treatments in each exposure time, using one-way ANOVAs followed by Tukey B post hoc comparisons.To compare the impacts of exposure time on the egg laying pattern, we calculated a midpoint of egg production (in days) for each individual, which is the period of time required for 50% of total egg production, For each stage, the relationships between midpoint of egg production and exposure time were analyzed through linear regression. A positive slope reflects postponed oviposition due to the heat stress, while a negative slope reflects an accelerated rate of oviposition.\nResults\n\nImmediate survival rate\nOverall, survival rate declined with an increase of exposure time at 40&#8201;&#176;C at all stages (Fig. 1). Significant differences in LT50 were apparent between development stages of Plutella (indicated by non-overlapping 95% confidence intervals) (Fig. 2). The 3rd-instar larvae proved to be the most heat tolerant, with an LT50 of 17.5&#8201;hrs. Pupae had a relatively higher heat tolerance with an LT50 of 10.4&#8201;hrs followed by egg (8.6&#8201;hrs) and male adult (8.1&#8201;hrs) stages, and 1st-instar larvae were the least heat tolerant with an LT50 of 5.0&#8201;hrs. Female adults displayed a lower LT50 than male adults, although the 95% confidence intervals overlapped.\nSubsequent survival (maturation success)\nFor egg treatments, heat exposure for 4 or 8&#8201;hrs did not result in a subsequent decrease in the number of adults that emerged from the hatched eggs compared to the control group, with a mean maturation success (&#177;SE) of 0.88&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.04 (Fig. 3a; F2,6&#8201;=&#8201;0.29, P&#8201;=&#8201;0.756). Hatchlings from eggs exposed to 12&#8201;hrs heat stress could not survive to the adult stage. Heat exposures on 1st-instar larvae did not influence the number of adults that emerged from the surviving larvae (Fig. 3b; F5,17&#8201;=&#8201;0.13, P&#8201;=&#8201;0.984). A complex pattern emerged for 3rd-instar larval treatments (Fig. 3c). As the exposure time increased from 0 to 16&#8201;hrs, maturation success decreased and was lowest (0.60) with the 16&#8201;hrs heat exposure (Fig. 3c; F6,21&#8201;=&#8201;4.38, P&#8201;=&#8201;0.011). However, maturation success increased as exposure time increased from 16 to 24&#8201;hrs, with a high survival (0.85, N&#8201;=&#8201;24) by those few that survived the 24&#8201;hrs treatment (Fig. 3c).\nFemale egg production\nOverall, egg production in the first 7 days declined with an increase in exposure time at 40&#8201;&#176;C across all stages (Fig. 4). Although only conditions where sufficient numbers of individuals survived could be considered, there is a consistent pattern in that regression slopes become steeper as later developmental stages are heat stressed, resulting in significant differences between slopes (Fig. 4f; regression slopes: F4,661&#8201;=&#8201;21.41, P&#8201;<&#8201;0.001; intercepts: F4,661&#8201;=&#8201;0.10, P&#8201;=&#8201;0.981). The adult treatment showed the fastest decline in egg production when the duration of thermal stress increased, followed by the pupal treatment. The decline in egg and 1st-instar larva treatments appeared to be slower than for the 3rd-instar larva treatment, but we found no significant difference in slopes between these treatments (Fig. 4f, F2,401&#8201;=&#8201;1.61, P&#8201;=&#8201;0.201). We examined different stage effects on adult egg production for each exposure time (Fig. S2). Stressed adults always produced the lowest egg numbers compared to pupal and larval treatments regardless of exposure time (Fig. S2, a-c, P&#8201;<&#8201;0.019). Adults from the pupal treatment always laid lower numbers of eggs than those from the 1st- or the 3rd-instar larval treatment (Fig. S2, a, d, e, P&#8201;<&#8201;0.002), although differences were not significant with exposures of 8&#8201;hrs (Fig. S2, b) or 12&#8201;hrs (Fig. S2, c). Heat treatment of 3rd-instar larvae tended to decrease egg production further than heat treatment of 1st-instar larvae, although these differences were small (Fig. S2, a-e). Regression analyses indicated no effect of exposure time on the midpoint of egg production of 1st-instar larval (Fig. 5b), pupal (Fig. 5d) or adult (Fig. 5e) treatments. However heat exposure time at the egg (Fig. 5a) and 3rd-instar larval treatments (Fig. 5c) did decrease the midpoint of egg production, reflecting faster egg laying by females from treatments with longer exposure times.\nDiscussion\nThis study considered the impacts of hot events experienced at different development stages in Plutella moths; a period at 40&#8201;&#176;C was used because this stress commonly occurs in agricultural production areas. To summarize the main findings, first instar larvae showed the lowest survival following exposure, whereas 3rd-instar larvae were relatively heat resistant. Heat exposure at early stages did not influence subsequent survival to adulthood (maturation success), while maturation success was affected by the 3rd-larval stage. Fecundity was affected most strongly by heat exposure at life stages closest to the adult stage rather than exposure at the earlier stage.\nStage-specific survival under heat stress\nOlder instar larvae (or nymphs) often survive better than adults in many insects27282930. Older larvae may rapidly balance water loss through mass feeding2931, while adult survival might be depressed if there is a trade-off between survival under stress and reproductive output3233. Our finding that older larvae of P. xylostella showed higher heat tolerance than pupae or adults is also consistent with other Plutella studies which have shown this life stage to have low resistance under different protocols, including constant warm temperatures34 and heat shock in a ramping regime19, suggesting that the relative sensitivity of different ontogenetic stages may not depend on the method used to test for heat responses in Plutella.Eggs, young larvae or pupae often have a relatively high level of heat tolerance. The pupae and eggs of Drosophila buzzatii35, Otiorhynchus sulcatus36 and Wyeomyia smithii17, as well as the early instar larvae of Bombyx mori37 and M. dirhodum28 are relatively tolerant of heat stress, perhaps because these stages have low mobility and are unable to evade a heat stress. In contrast, we found that first-instar larvae, eggs, and pupae of Plutella had relatively low heat resistance compared to other larval stages. This pattern has also been found for other Plutella studies1934. Stress resistance may be affected by past selection pressures depending on the environment where different developmental stages are found738. Plutella eggs, first instar larvae and pupae usually occur on the underside of leaves39, where temperatures are cooler in hot days4041, and this may help explain the relative sensitivity of these stages in contrast to the pattern in other insects.\nHeat stress effects on reproduction\nThe finding that heat stress on a life history stage closer to the adult stage is more detrimental for reproduction rather than heat applied at earlier stages may also apply to other taxa. Reproduction of the Homoptera insect, M. dirhodum, is reduced further by heat stress during late stages (4th-instar and adult stage) than early stages (2nd- and 3rd-instar)16. Egg production of the Diptera species, W. smithii appears to be depressed further by heat stress during the pupal stage than the egg or larval stages17. Lepidopteran studies involving Plutella10 and Manduca sexta11 also point to heat stress in the egg stage failing to influence adult reproduction. In addition to reproduction, morphological traits were impacted more by heat stress closer to adult stage than at earlier stages. In the Coleoptera species, Harmonia axyridis, adult body size and coloration were affected by heat stress at the 4th-instar larval or pupal stages but not at early development stages42. Moreover, in the butterfly, Bicyclus anynana, wing pattern was sensitive only to late larval stage temperatures43.Stage-specific heat effects on reproduction might depend on whether enough time has elapsed for recovery to occur. Adult stresses often influence egg maturation and oviposition due to direct damage4445. In addition, adult Lepidoptera may allocate less nitrogen and other resources to maturing eggs when they are stressed; stresses at the adult or late larval stage may reduce availability of these resources4647, particularly as nutrition and water intake is required by insects to compensate for adverse conditions. Stresses on larval stages well before the adult stage may not have much impact on reproduction because holometabolous insects can repair and restructure morphology and physiological metabolism through metamorphosis4849 to reduce the long-term effects on subsequent life-stages1011.Stressful conditions often induce adults to lay eggs as early as possible to avoid possible detrimental impacts later in life50. We found that heat stress applied to eggs or 3rd-instar larvae led to a faster rate of oviposition in Plutella. Body injuries have previously been reported to accelerate egg-laying50. Potential heat injury in eggs and 3rd-instar larvae might be carried over to the adult stage and lead to a more rapid rate of egg laying.\nPotential applications\nUnderstanding how hot days affect population dynamics is likely to be important for pest management. To date, most studies on climate change have investigated effects of changes in mean temperature51 and fluctuating temperatures52 during an entire life cycle on organism performance. Ambient temperatures are rarely constant or rarely fluctuate in a fixed cycle. Instead in species with relatively short generation times, it is possible that any developmental stage might experience an extremely hot day.Clearly the timing of hot events is likely to have important consequences for population size and local pest pressures involving Plutella due to effects on survival (immediate and through influencing maturation success) and reproduction. The number of surviving adults was reduced much more by a single hot event (e.g. 40&#8201;&#176;C for 8&#8201;hrs) at the adult stage (>74%) than at other stages (<32%). In addition, reproduction was depressed furthest by a single hot event at the adult stage (55%), followed by pupal (28%), 3rd-instar (20%) and 1st-instar larval (12%) stages. If pests in a crop are mostly at late larval stage, heat stress may have less impact on population size because survival and reproduction are not affected much by such a stress. On the other hand, exposures at a later stage might depress population size and reduce pest pressures. Our results therefore highlight the importance of understanding how hot days affect survival and reproduction performance of the population with complex age/stage structure when predicting population dynamics under extreme events increasing in frequency under climate change.\nAdditional Information\nHow to cite this article: Zhang, W. et al.

This study examines the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms in promoter regions of MMP-1 and MMP-3 with susceptibility to oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC).Methods\nWe compared 170 Japanese OSCC cases and 164 healthy controls for genotypes of MMP-1 and MMP-3.Results\nThe frequency of the MMP-1 2G allele was higher and that of the 1G homozygote was lower in the OSCC cases (p = 0.034). A multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that subjects who were 45 years old or older had a significantly increased (2.47-fold) risk of OSCC (95%CI 1.47&#8211;4.14, p = 0.0006), and those carrying the MMP-1 2G allele had a 2.30-fold risk (95%CI 1.15&#8211;4.58, p = 0.018), indicating independent involvement of these factors in OSCC. One of the key discoveries of this research is the apparent reduction of the MMP-1 1G/1G and 1G/2G genotype distributions among the early onset OSCC cases under the ages of 45 years. It should be noted that the tongue was the primary site in 86.2% of these early onset cases. This could suggest the specific carcinogenic mechanisms, i.e. specific carcinogenic stimulations and/or genetic factors in the tongue.Conclusion\nSince the 2G allele is a majority of the MMP-1 genotype in the general population, it seems to act as a genetic pre-condition in OSCC development. However this report suggests a crucial impact of the MMP-1 2G allele in the early onset OSCC.", "body": "Background\nMatrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1 (Collagenase-1) is a major proteinase of the MMP family that specifically degrades type I collagen, which is a major component of the extracellular matrix (ECM), as well as other fibrillar collagens of types II, III, V and IX [1,2]. MMP-3 (Stromelysine-1) is responsible for degradation of type IV collagen, which forms the basement membrane, and collagen V, IX, X [3]. MMP-3 also has a role in activation of proMMP-1 in tumor tissue into the active form of MMP-1 [4]. Gene expression data in our previous report demonstrated enhanced expression of MMP family genes in OSCC tissues, and suggested correlation of high expression levels of MMP-1 and MMP-3 with aggressive behavior, such as metastasis, and clinical prognosis [5]. Similar correlations have been reported in pharyngeal, colon and various other tumor types [6-8]. Colocalization of MMP-1 and MMP-3 with destruction of ECM in the invasive front of cancer tissue suggests a direct role in cancer invasion [9].It has also been shown that a function of MMPs affects susceptibility to different kinds of carcinoma. To date, polymorphisms of the promoter domain have been described in MMP-1, -3, -9, -12 to influence the expression level of the genes [10]. A 2G type of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at -1607 bp site in the promoter domain of MMP-1 creates a sequence, 5'-GGA-3,' that is the core recognition sequence of the binding site for Ets family transcription factors. The 2G type promoter results in higher transcription activity of the MMP-1 gene than does a 1G type promoter [11]. A 5A type promoter at -1171 bp site of MMP-3 is also known to have a twofold higher transcriptional activity in vitro than that of a 6A type [12]. It has been documented that the 2G type SNP of MMP-1 confers increased susceptibility to colorectal [13], ovarian [14], lung [15], endometrial [16], renal cell [17] and head and neck [18] cancers; and the 5A type SNP of MMP-3 is associated with an increased susceptibility to breast cancer [19].An in situ hybridization study revealed that MMP-1 expression in normal oral mucosa is controlled at a low level, whereas a remarkably elevated expression level is observed in cases of oral epithelial dysplasia, which becomes even higher in cases of OSCC [20]. It has also been documented that cases of oral epithelial dysplasia showing high expression level of MMP-1 developed into OSCC at higher frequency than cases with low expression of MMP-1 [21]. Taking all the observations noted above into consideration, it seems likely that MMPs may serve as key factors in all stages of the OSCC progression from carcinogenesis in the early precancerous condition to the advanced invasive and metastatic phases.The purpose of this study is to document the effect of genomic polymorphisms of MMP genes in the development of OSCC. We compared genotype distribution in the promoter domains of the functional SNPs that influence the transcriptional activity of MMP-1 and MMP-3 between OSCC patients and healthy control groups. Multivariate analysis was effectively used to assess correlations among parameters such as OSCC, the genotypes, age and sex. In this report, we describe the role of functional SNP of the MMP-1 gene in susceptibility to OSCC and, as a remarkable finding; we discuss the crucial impact of the MMP-1 2G allele in the development of OSCC in younger individuals.\nMethods\n\nStudy subjects\nThe tested cases were all unrelated native Japanese comprising 170 cases of OSCC (107 males, 63 females; average age 56.5 &#177; 13.9 years) who were histopathologically diagnosed as differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. The controls comprised 164 (104 males, 60 females) healthy subjects who did not have a history of malignant tumors and were frequency-matched to the cases by age (&#177; 5 years; average age 51.5 &#177; 14.7 years). All OSCC subjects were patients who had been treated in the Dental Department of Niigata University Medical and Dental Hospital, Special Dental Care and Oral Surgery, Shinshu University Hospital, and Division of Oral Surgery, Nagaoka Red Cross Hospital.Blood samples were taken after obtaining the patients' informed consent to participate in the study and processed anonymously. All cases were diagnosed histopathologically as OSCC. The study protocol was approved by the ethics committees of each institution.\nGenotyping of \n5 ml of blood was obtained from the subjects and used as the source of peripheral blood lymphocytes. 0.2% NaCl was added for destruction of red blood cells, followed by addition of TNE buffer, 10% SDS and Proteinase K (MERCK Co., Darmstadt, Germany). After incubation at 58&#176;C for more than six hours, genomic DNA was extracted by phenol-chloroform treatment and ethanol precipitation. The reaction was performed in a 25 &#956;l volume made up of 70 ng genomic DNA, 2.25 &#956;l of the specific forward/reverse primer (10 &#956;M), 1 &#956;l of TaqMan&#174; MGB probes (5 &#956;M), 12.5 &#956;l of TaqMan&#174; Universal Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). PCR cycling conditions were 10 min of initial denaturation at 95&#176;C followed by 35 cycles of 15 sec denaturation at 92&#176;C and 1 min of one step annealing/extension at 60&#176;C for MMP-1 or 62&#176;C for MMP-3 (ABI Prism&#174; 7900 HT Sequence Detection System, Applied Biosystems). Combination of the probe/primer used for the MMP-1 SNP were: Forward primer, 5'-TGCCACTTAGATGAGGAAATTGTAGT-3' and reverse primer, 5'-ACACTTTCCTCCCCTTATGGATTC-3', TaqMan&#174; MGB probes, FAM for 1G, 5'-ATAATTAGAAAGATATGACTTATC-3' and VIC for 2G, 5'-ATAATTAGAAAGGATATGACTTAT-3'; used for the MMP-3 SNP were: Forward primer, 5'-ACATCACTGCCACCACTCTGTT-3' and reverse primer, 5'-GGCACCTGGCCTAAAGACATT-3', TaqMan&#174; MGB probes, FAM for 5A, 5'-AAGACATGGTTTTTC-3' and VIC for 6A, 5'-AGACATGGTTTTTTC-3'.\nStatistical analysis\nThe Chi-square test was used to examine the differences in genotype distribution of the MMP-1 and MMP-3 promoters between the OSCC cases and control groups, and to estimate correlation or synergistic effects of MMP-1 genotypes with regard to clinical consequences as well as environmental factors among the OSCC cases. A p-value of < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Univariate analysis was performed by Fisher's exact test (two-sided) on gender, carrier state of MMP-1 1G allele (1G+ or 1G-) and 2G allele (2G+ or 2G-) between the OSCC and control groups. In the consideration of latent interrelations between factors, the effects of MMP-1 2G allele, age and gender were estimated by a multivariate logistic regression model. For each parameter, the OSCC risk was accounted by Odds Ratios (OR) and 95% Confidence Intervals (95% CI). All of the statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS 11.5J software package (SPSS Japan Inc., Tokyo, Japan).\nResults\n\nGenotype distributions of \nThe genotype distributions of the promoter SNPs in MMP-1 and MMP-3 genes did not indicate a departure from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium when they were examined separately in the OSCC (n = 170) and control (n = 164) groups, or in all the samples combined (n = 334) (&#967;2  0.05). The frequency of 1G/2G or 2G/2G promoter genotypes having the 2G allele, which is associated with a high MMP-1 expression level, was significantly higher in the OSCC group, and the frequency of the 1G/1G homozygote was lower than that of the control group (p = 0.034, Table 1). On the other hand, no difference in MMP-3 genotype distribution (5A/5A, 5A/6A, and 6A/6A) was detected between the OSCC case and control groups.\nAssociation between \nMMP-1 promoter genotypes of OSCC cases were stratified by clinical parameters including gender, age (Table 2), T category, lymph-node metastasis (N category), tumor location in the oral cavity, status of alcohol intake and smoking (Table 3). A significant association was detected only between the age and MMP-1 genotype, which suggests accumulation of older age patients with the 1G allele, or young age patients with the 2G allele. Figure 1 shows the age distribution pattern of subjects with MMP-1 promoter genotypes in OSCC groups, demonstrating a remarkable reduction of the 1G/1G and 1G/2G genotype distributions in OSCC cases less than 45 years and 35 years old. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve consistently exhibited that the 45 years of age could be an optimal cutoff value of the age at which to stratify the young OSCC from the older bracket in following analyses. It was of considerable interest to notice that the MMP-1 promoter genotype has a remarkable difference in distribution between subjects over and under 45 years of age. A significant difference was demonstrated in susceptibility to OSCC in individuals less or more than 45 years old (p = 0.002, OR = 2.26, 95%CI = 1.35&#8211;3.79) (Table 4). No association was observed with the 1G allele (1G/1G and 1G/2G; p = 0.294, OR = 1.29, 95%CI = 0.84&#8211;2.00, whereas a significantly elevated risk of OSCC was exhibited with the 2G allele (2G/2G and 1G/2G; p = 0.016, OR = 2.39, 95%CI = 1.21&#8211;4.72. The environmental factors, alcohol intake and smoking status were stratified with MMP-1 genotype distributions in OSCC cases, but no significant association was demonstrated of either factor with the MMP-1 genotype distribution (Table 3).\nMultivariate analyses of \nLogistic regression analysis of OSCC in relation to age, gender, and presence of the 1G and 2G alleles revealed that subjects of 45 years old and older had a 2.47-fold significantly increased risk of OSCC (p = 0.0006, 95%CI = 1.47&#8211;4.14) and that those carrying the MMP-1 2G allele had a 2.30-fold significantly elevated risk (p = 0.018, 95%CI = 1.15&#8211;4.58). Thus it was demonstrated that age and the presence of the 2G allele were independently associated with OSCC onset (Table 5).\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we examined SNPs in the promoter regions of MMP-1 and MMP-3 genes in relation to OSCC risk with case-control analyses. Significant differences, i.e., high frequency of 2G/2G genotype and decreased frequency of 1G/1G genotype, were observed in the MMP-1 genotype distribution in OSCC cases (p = 0.034, Table 1). Similarly, in comparisons of allele frequency a significant correlation was detected between onset of OSCC and genotypes that carry the MMP-1 promoter 2G allele in homo- or hetero-form (p = 0.016, OR = 2.39, 95%CI = 1.21&#8211;4.72). MMP-1 with the 2G type promoter caused a higher expression level of MMP-1 in tissues [11]. The biological mechanism of the elevated risk of OSCC as related to the 2G allele of MMP-1 promoter includes genetic instability, which is accompanied by the cell cycle activation caused by a sequence of events led by increased MMP-1 enzyme activity, i.e. activation of tissue disruption, reconstruction and resultant release of ECM binding growth factors. The relationship between MMP-1 promoter polymorphism and risk of OSCC has been investigated by Lin et al. in a group of 121 cases [22] and by Cao et al. in a group of 96 cases [23] and by Vairaktaris et al. in a group of 156 cases [24]. Although both Lin et al. and Cao et al.reported an elevation of OSCC risk correlated with the MMP-1 2G allele, further studies were needed to reach a conclusion mainly because the numbers of cases in the previous studies were relatively small, and there were differences between these reports in background analyses on correlation with environmental risk factors, such as smoking and areca use. In this study, significant correlations were found between the presence of the MMP-1 promoter 2G allele and increased OSCC risk among 170 Japanese OSCC patients. These results are consistent with existing reports on malignant neoplasms in general. It is notable that a new finding on the molecular function of MMP-1 in the onset of OSCC was obtained from the characteristic pattern of the MMP-1 promoter genotype distribution in younger patients.Interestingly, Vairaktaris et al. reported an increased risk of oral cancer with MMP-1 1G/2G polymorphism [24]. The discrepancy of the results of the Chinese studies and our report on one hand and the European (German and Greek) study on the other hand may be explained by the diverse ethnic background of the different studied populations. Another point of difference is the fact that their patient sample included patients with positive family history of thrombophilia.The observed bias of the average age by the MMP-1 promoter genotype among the 170 OSCC cases of this study suggested an influence of the MMP-1 promoter 2G allele on the age of OSCC onset. The scatter plot of age on the MMP-1 promoter genotypes also revealed disappearance of the 1G/1G-genotype distribution among the OSCC cases under 45 years old. In agreement with this observation, the ROC analysis suggested that the age of 45 years is the borderline age above which a change occurs in the incidence of OSCC. Although the specific reasons for these results have not been clarified, they suggest that some kind of biological conditions related to carcinogenesis have initiated around the age of 45. Carcinogenesis is caused by synergistic effects of various factors [25,26]. The multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that aging and presence of the MMP-1 2G allele (i.e., 2G/2G or 1G/2G) are independently involved in onset of OSCC. In fact, it was clarified that the significance of the presence of the MMP-1 2G allele was lower in the subject group 45 years old or older (p = 0.238, OR = 1.65, 95% CI = 0.75&#8211;3.55), and that the impact of the allele was highly significant in the younger group, which was under 45 years old (p = 0.014, OR = 9.67, 95% CI = 1.20&#8211;78.15) (data not shown).As concrete causes of OSCC, mainly tobacco smoking and alcohol usage and, in some cases, viral infections have attracted attention as environmental causative factors [25,27]. It has been suggested that tobacco smoking and alcohol usage alone may not explain the mechanism of the entire early onset of OSCC, because the duration of exposure to these risk factors in young OSCC patients is shorter than in the older group, and also because there are some cases with stable incidence that have no known risk factors [28]. The association with smoking and habitual drinking has been supported as the risk factors of OSCC, which generally shows a higher incidence in older age, but other investigators believe that the mechanism of the early onset OSCC is fundamentally different from that of elderly onset OSCC [25]. Cao et al. considered the relationship with smoking as a behavioral risk factor and the MMP-1 2G allele as a genetic risk factor in the OSCC group [23]. In lung cancer, it has been similarly shown that a genetic factor of the MMP-1 promoter 2G allele increases the risk of cancer that occurs in a tobacco-usage-dependent manner only in cases with a history of tobacco use. These reports support the role of MMP-1 promoter polymorphism as an endogenous background factor, in contrast to exogenous environmental factors [15]. However, no evidence to support a notion of synergistic interactions between risk factors, such as habitual smoking and drinking and MMP-1 promoter polymorphism in OSCC cases, was shown in this study. Further investigations with regard to frequency and duration of exposure are required to consider interactions between environmental factors and multiple genetic background factors.Examples are known of malignant neoplasms caused by genetic factors, for example, mutations in RB in Retinoblastoma [29], p53 in Li-Fraumeni Syndrome [30], and APC in familial adenomatous polyposis [31]. There are also reports of mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2, which affect familial breast cancer occurrence, though their penetrance is low [32]. These are neoplasms that are all caused by loss-of-function mutations in molecules functionally classified as tumor-suppressor genes, and they are characterized by familial, juvenile or young onset and may be multicentric or bilateral. Although incidents are rare in the population, they are examples of germline mutations that directly involve heterofamilial tumorigenesis.By contrast, the MMP-1 promoter 2G allele is a genetic polymorphism that exists at the high allele frequency of 80% to 90% in the general population. It is possible to call this a hereditary trait that is shared among races or humans in general. Other genetic factors that are classified into similar polymorphism as MMP-1 have also been reported, such as Cyclin D1 (CCND1) in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and colorectal cancer [33,34], xeroderma pigmentosum complementary group D (XPD), DNA damage binding protein 2 (DDB2), and MMP-9 in lung cancer [35-37]. Similar to the effects of mutations in tumor suppressor genes, diversity in gene expression level and molecular structure caused by genetic polymorphisms affect monitoring and repair mechanism of DNA replication, as well as control of the cell cycle, ultimately resulting in genetic instability. The common mechanism of carcinogenesis caused by those genetic factors is an elevated carcinogenic risk due to this genetic instability.As examples of genetic polymorphisms that affect onset age of cancers other than that examined in this study, some reports discuss MMP-1 and DDB2 in lung cancer [15,36], and CCND1 in HNSCC and colorectal cancer [33,34]. These genetic factors, on the other hand, are present in patients with cancer as well as in the general population at certain frequencies. Therefore, it is hard to conclude that these genetic factors are the primary factors in early onset carcinogenesis, unlike germline single-gene mutations in Rb and APC that induce juvenile or early onset of cancers with high penetrance. Aging brings exposure to various carcinogenic factors and is associated with inevitable accumulation of genetic and epigenetic modifications of genes. These accumulations interact synergistically with biological background factors on the host side, and consequently cancer may develop [26,38]. It seems that inherited genetic factors play a larger role in development of early onset cancer that has undergone a relatively short duration of exposure to carcinogen through environment and lifestyle habits. Therefore, it is conceivable that the impact of these genetic factors would appear more directly in younger than in older cases, although we still expect a synergistic involvement of various environmental and genetic factors. Nevertheless, because of the disappearance ofthe MMP-1 1G allele distribution observed in the OSCC cases with a clear boundary under the age of 45 years, the MMP-1 promoter 2G allele should be recognized as an essential genetic precondition for the development of early onset OSCC.It is said that an onset age of 45 years and younger accounts for about 6% of OSCC cases [27]. It should be noted that in this study we found that the tongue was the primary site in 25 cases (86.2%) of 29 early onset OSCC cases in individuals under 45 years old. This primary site was obviously different from that in patients 45 years old and older in whom we noted 57 cases of tongue cancer (40.4%) out of 141 OSCC cases. Similar tendencies have been reported in previous studies [39,40]. These findings suggest the possibility that each primary tumor sites in the oral cavity may be associated with differences in cancer susceptibility, specific carcinogenic stimulation, or genetic background. However, no environmental or genetic factors specific to a particular site of the oral mucosa have been identified for OSCC. It is conceivable that it would be important to carry out further investigations on genetic and environmental risk factors for each anatomical site of the oral regions, though we are not able to discuss this aspect of OSCC because the number of cases was inadequate in this study.\nConclusion\nThe number of cases in this study was relatively small; therefore, the conclusions may still be contingent upon confirmation in a larger study. To evaluate the conclusive impact of MMP-1 on OSCC risk, a sufficiently large number of cases or consistency among results from multiple age adjusted studies would be needed. Furthermore, although the MMP-1 promoter SNP-based determination of OSCC susceptibility has the potential to become a useful clinical tool, it is necessary to add a greater diversity of information for practical use. In the future, improvements in diagnosis of susceptibility and clinical application could become possible by incorporating multiple genetic and environmental risk factors into the prediction model for cancer occurrence. Information about the risk of various types of malignant neoplasm as well as OSCC is useful for prevention and early detection of cancer or for monitoring of postoperative recurrence. A diagnostic system for evaluating cancer risk is vital not only for improvement in treatment techniques but also as a theoretical foundation to build strategies for cancer prevention.\nAbbreviations\nMatrix metalloproteinase (MMP), single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), odds ratio (OR), 95% Confidence Intervals (95% CI), receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).\nCompeting interests\nThe author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors' contributions\nRN, MN participated in the design of the study.

However, the functional and molecular mechanisms of this association are not known. In most cases of acquired LQTS, the target ion channel is the human ether-&#225;-go-go-related gene (hERG) encoding the rapid component of the delayed rectifier K current, IKr, which plays a critical role in cardiac repolarization. Here, we tested the hypothesis that IL-6 may cause QT prolongation by suppressing IKr. Electrophysiological and biochemical assays were used to assess the impact of IL-6 on the functional expression of IKr in HEK293 cells and adult guinea-pig ventricular myocytes (AGPVM). In HEK293 cells, IL-6 alone or in combination with the soluble IL-6 receptor (IL-6R), produced a significant depression of IKr peak and tail current densities. Block of IL-6R or Janus kinase (JAK) reversed the inhibitory effects of IL-6 on IKr. In AGPVM, IL-6 prolonged action potential duration (APD) which was further prolonged in the presence of IL-6R. Similar to heterologous cells, IL-6 reduced endogenous guinea pig ERG channel mRNA and protein expression. The data are first to demonstrate that IL-6 inhibition of IKr and the resulting prolongation of APD is mediated via IL-6R and JAK pathway activation and forms the basis for the observed clinical QT interval prolongation. These novel findings may guide the development of targeted anti-arrhythmic therapeutic interventions in patients with LQTS and inflammatory disorders.", "body": "Introduction\nIL-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine involved in a variety of biological effects including cardiomyocyte response to injury[1]. IL-6 effects occur either through a membrane-bound receptor, the IL-6R &#945; subunit (classical signaling) or a soluble receptor (sIL-6R) [2] complexed with the signal transduction protein glycoprotein 130 (gp130) leading to the activation of the JAK-related signaling pathways [3, 4]. Previous studies demonstrated that circulating IL-6 levels are elevated in patients with autoimmune-inflammatory disorders and may underlie increased vulnerability to QT interval prolongation that contributes prominently to arrhythmic events and Torsade de Pointes (TdP) [5&#8211;7].Cardiac and systemic inflammation are associated with the prolongation of corrected QT (QTc) and higher propensity to develop TdP, as demonstrated by accumulating data obtained from patients with myocarditis/endocarditis [8], and systemic autoimmune diseases, particularly rheumatoid arthritis (RA) [9], and other connective tissue disease (CTD) [7], as well as in apparently healthy subjects from the general population [10].Among systemic autoimmune diseases, the largest evidence involves RA and other CTDs. In RA, a chronic disease with high-grade inflammatory burden, the risk of cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death (SCD) is ~2 times higher than in non-RA patients [11, 12]. Furthermore, prolonged QTc is seen in RA patients [13, 14] and has also been associated with disease severity [14, 15], altered levels of inflammatory markers, including IL-6 [6], as well as presenting as an independent predictor of mortality [14, 16, 17]. RA patients treated with the anti-IL-6R blocker tocilizumab, have also been shown to display a rapid and significant QTc shortening, in addition to decreased levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and TNF-&#945; [9].Furthermore, a recent study of a large cohort of RA women demonstrated that inflammation, as assessed by circulating IL-6 levels, correlated more strongly with fatal than non-fatal cardiovascular events [18]. In CTDs patients, a high prevalence of QTc prolongation (up to ~30%) has been reported [7], with circulating IL-1&#946; levels independently predicting the presence of a prolonged QTc [19]. Noteworthy, 10 cases of drug-induced TdP in systemic lupus erythematosus patients were reported in the literature, and although CRP level was specifically assessed only in two cases, nevertheless it was elevated in both [7]. These observations provide initial clues as to the potential direct electrophysiological effects of IL-6 on ion channels that can alter action potential duration (APD) and QTc interval.In the heart, the human ether-&#225;-go-go-related gene, hERG (or KCNH2), which encodes the pore-forming subunit of the rapidly activating component of IKr, is critical for cardiac repolarization [20, 21]. The functional depression of IKr by either drugs, genetic defects or inhibiting autoantibodies [22] causes delayed repolarization leading to prolongation of the QTc on the surface electrocardiogram (ECG) [23] predisposing to SCD [24]. Emerging experimental evidence has shown that inflammatory responses mainly via TNF-&#945;, IL-1&#946;, and IL-6 regulate cardiomyocyte electrophysiological properties [25&#8211;29]. TNF-&#945; has been shown to decrease IKr and the transient outward current (Ito) that is also inhibited by IL-1&#946; [30], while IL-1&#946; [28] and IL-6 [31] increase L-type Ca current (ICa,L) altogether leading to prolongation of APD [28]. However, it is unknown whether IL-6 affects cardiac IKr.Recently, we showed increased circulating levels of IL-6 in both RA patients and unselected general population with TdP [5], with no measurable changes in TNF-&#945; or IL-1. This outcome led us to hypothesize that selective pathological increases in IL-6 may affect hERG/IKr, thereby contributing to arrhythmias associated with autoimmune-inflammatory responses [8]. Here, we unravel a novel autoimmune/inflammatory channelopathy as a risk factor for SCD whereby IL-6-mediated inhibition of IKr underlie QTc prolongation seen in these patients.\nMethods\n\nHEK293 cells stably expressing hERG channel\nThe stably transfected HEK293 cells with hERG channel (HEK-hERG) were a kind gift from Dr Gail Robertson from the University of Wisconsin Madison. They were cultured in Dulbecco&#8217;s minimum essential medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 &#956;g/ml geneticin (G418, Gibco; Grand Island, NY, USA). Cells were washed twice with standard DMEM medium and stored in this medium at room temperature for later use. A coverslip with adherent HEK-hERG cells was placed on the glass bottom of a recording chamber (0.8&#8211;1 ml in volume) mounted on the stage of an inverted microscope (Diaphot, Nikon). The internal solution contained (in mmol/L): 130 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 0.4 GTP, 5 EGTA, 5 K2ATP, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.2). External solution contained (in mmol/L): 137 NaCl, 4 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 Glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.4). When filled with internal solution, the pipette resistance was typically 1.5&#8211;2 MOhm. Series resistance was compensated 80&#8211;90% before each recording. Membrane potentials were corrected for liquid junctional potential. Population current-voltage (I&#8211;V) curves were generated by step depolarizations (-60 to +60 mV), from a holding potential of -80 mV in 10 mV increments for 1 s, followed by a repolarizing step to -40 mV for 5 s to obtain tail currents (Itail). The voltage dependence of steady-state activation of IKr in HEK-hERG cells was measured from tail currents recorded at -40 mV following 4 sec steps to voltages in the range -60 to +60 mV and the data fitted using a Boltzmann function to obtain the midpoint of the steady-state activation curve (V1/2). Currents were sampled at 20 kHz and filtered at 5 or 10 kHz. Traces were acquired at a repetition interval of 10 s. Here and elsewhere cells were pre-treated with IL-6 (20 ng/ml) alone or IL-6 (20 ng/ml) + IL-6R (25 ng/ml) for 40 minutes before experimentation [31]. For the dose-response experiments, in addition to 20 ng/ml, doses of 4 ng/ml and 80 ng/ml of IL-6 were studied in the presence of a constant dose of IL-6R of 25ng/ml. IL-6R is used because the soluble form of the IL-6R (sIL-6R) has been found in body fluids such as blood and high levels of sIL-6R have been reported in several chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases hence the ability to regulate cells lacking IL-6R [2]. All experiments were performed at room temperature.\nGuinea-pig ventricular myocytes\nPrimary guinea pigs&#8217; ventricular cardiac myocytes (used in electrophysiological and biochemical assays) were isolated as previously described [20, 32&#8211;34]. Briefly, adult male and female Hartley guinea pigs were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane in accordance with the IACUC approval of this study at the VA New York Harbor Healthcare System and conforming to the NIH guidelines. Hearts were excised, Langendorff perfused with Tyrode solution containing (in mM): 118 NaCl, 4.8 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 10 Glucose, 1.25 MgSO4, 1.25 K2HPO4 (pH = 7.4) for 5 minutes. The heart was then perfused with Ca2+-free Tyrode solution for 10 minutes before switching to Ca2+-free Tyrode solution containing Collagenase B (final concentration, 0.6 mg/ml; Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN) for an additional 6 minutes. The heart was subsequently perfused with high-K solution containing (in mM): 70 KOH, 50 L-glutamic acid (potassium salt), 40 KCl, 10 Taurine, 2 MgCl2, 10 Glucose, 10 HEPES, 5 EGTA, and 1% albumin (pH 7.4, with KOH) for 5&#8211;10 minutes. The digested heart tissue was placed in fresh high-K solution, minced into smaller pieces and triturated several times to dissociate the cells. The cell suspension was filtered through a mesh and allowed to settle for 15&#8211;20 min. The pellet was resuspended in 10% M199 media and plated on laminin-coated coverslips. Cells were patched 6&#8211;8 hours after plating. The external solution used for IKr and IK1 recordings contained (in mM): 145 NaCl, 4.5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1.8 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, and 10 glucose (pH 7.4). Ca currents were blocked by the addition of 5 &#956;M nifedipine in the bath solution and the slow delayed rectifier K current (IKs) was blocked with 100 &#956;M chromanol. The pipette solutions for recording IKr and IK1 contained (in mM): 140 KCl, 10 HEPES, 11 EGTA, 1 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 5 MgATP, and 5 K2ATP; the pH adjusted to 7.2 with KOH. Currents were recorded in the whole-cell, voltage clamp configuration of the patch-clamp technique using an Axopatch-200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Inc., Burlingame, CA). IKr was recorded using a short 200 ms depolarizing pulse from a holding potential (HP) of -50 mV and test pulses were applied at various voltages from -40 to +80 mV in a 10 mV increment before returning to -40 mV for tail current recording. IK1 was activated from -80 mV to test potential ranging from -120 mV to +10 mV in 10 mV steps for 200 ms. The external solution for INa recordings contained (in mM): 20 NaCl, 5 CsCl, 115 tetraethylammonium chloride (TEACl), 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, and 10 glucose (pH 7.4, with CsOH). L-type Ca current and T-type Ca current were blocked by CoCl2 (5 mM) and NiCl2 (1 mM), respectively. The internal solution contained (in mM): 140 CsCl, 10 NaCl, 3 MgCl2, 5 EGTA, 10 HEPES, and 2 MgATP (pH 7.2, CsOH). INa was evoked from -80 mV to test potentials ranging from -70 mV to +20 mV in 10 ms steps for 30 ms. Action potentials were recorded from single ventricular myocytes in current-clamp mode by passing depolarizing currents at subthreshold (1.4 X) intensity. Data were sampled with an A/D converter (Digital 1320A, Axon Instruments) and stored on the hard disk of a computer for subsequent analysis. Currents were sampled at 20 kHz and filtered at 5 or 10 kHz. Traces were acquired at a repetition interval of 10 s.\nBiochemical assays\n\nWestern blots analysis\nWhole cell lysates from HEK293 stably expressing hERG channels and freshly isolated guinea pig cardiomyocytes were used for Western blot analysis. The cells were collected by centrifugation for 5 min at 1,000 g and the pellet was lysed using radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Walthman, MA) and 10% protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma, St Louis, MO), incubated on ice for 30 minutes and then centrifuged at 15,000 g for 20 min. The supernatant was collected and the proteins concentration was measured with a Bradford protein assay using EnsSpire 2300 Multimode Plate Reader (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA). Proteins (50 &#956;g/lane HEK-hERG or 100 &#956;g/lane myocytes) were separated on 4&#8211;15% Tris-HCl gel (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) and electroblotted for 2hr onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Biorad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Non-specific interactions were blocked using 2.5% non-fat milk (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA), 2.5% BSA (Sigma, St Louis, MO) and 0.1% Tween 20 in Tris-Buffered saline. The membrane was then immunoblotted with anti-KV11.1/hERG (extracellular) antibody (1:150; Alomone, Jerusalem, Israel) or rabbit anti-GAPDH antibody (1:1000; Sigma,St Louis, MO) overnight at 4&#176;C. GAPDH expression was used as loading control. The membrane was then probed with anti-rabbit IgG HRP-linked secondary antibody (1:5000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX) for 1hr at room temperature and signals were visualized with a chemiluminescence kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Blots were scanned in a C-Digit blot scanner (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE) at high sensitivity to obtain the image. For quantification of Western blot data, the band intensities of proteins of interest were normalized to their respective GAPDH intensities.\nIsolation of RNA, cDNA synthesis and RT-PCR\nTotal RNA was purified using RNeasy fibrous tissue mini-kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) was used to quantify RNA and to determine the purity of samples. 1 &#956;g RNA was reverse transcribed using High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, Waltham, MA) and qPCR was then carried out on cDNA using TaqMan Fast Advanced Mastermix (Applied Biosystems, Waltham, MA). Genes coding for KCNH2 (Kv11.1) and GAPDH were amplified on Applied Biosystem's 7500 Real-Time PCR system. Taqman Gene Expression Assay primers were used, and these were obtained from IDT (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA). Primers contained the double quenched probe (5&#8242;FAM/ZEN/3&#8242;IBFQ) and ROX passive reference dye was used. Gene expression in treated guinea pig cardiomyocytes was represented as a fold change relative to expression in untreated cells.\nData and statistical analyses\nElectrophysiological data were analyzed off-line using built in functions in clampfit (pCLAMP 10), and Origin software. Quantification of Western blot data was performed by analyzing band intensities of proteins and then normalized to their respective GAPDH intensities. For all electrophysiology and biochemistry assays, the effect of IL-6 alone or IL-6+IL-6R basal IKr or hERG expression (mRNA and protein expression) were compared using one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-hoc analysis or two-tailed unpaired t test for comparisons between groups and considered significant at P < 0.05. Data are reported as means &#177; S.E.M.\nResults\n\nIL-6 inhibits \nFirst, we assessed the effects of IL-6 on IKr current in HEK-hERG cells using the whole-cell patch clamp technique and the protocol shown in Fig 1A. Cells were exposed to IL-6 (20 ng/ml) alone or IL-6 (20ng/ml)+IL-6R (25 ng/ml) at concentrations previously shown to modulate ICa,L in myocytes after 40 minutes pre-incubation [31]. Compared to basal IKr (Fig 1B), cells pre-incubated with IL-6 alone (Fig 1C) displayed depressed IKr densities (Fig 1E & 1F). At +20 mV, IKr peak densities were inhibited by 29.6% (from 44.9&#177;4.43 pA/pF, n = 21, to 31.6&#177;2.04 pA/pF, n = 18, *P<0.05, Fig 1E), and IKr tail densities were inhibited by 41.9% at +20 mV (from 66&#177;7.11 pA/pF, n = 21, to 38.3&#177;4.38 pA/pF, n = 18, *P<0.05, Fig 1F). In the presence of IL-6R (Fig 1D), IL-6 inhibited IKr peak densities by 53.6% at +20 mV (from 44.9&#177;4.43 pA/pF, n = 21, to 20.8&#177;2.50 pA/pF, n = 9, *P<0.05, Fig 1E) and IKr tail densities by 59.5% at +20 mV (from 66&#177;7.11 pA/pF, n = 21, to 26.7&#177;3.94 pA/pF, n = 9, *P<0.05, Fig 1F).Furthermore, we investigated whether the effect of IL-6 on IKr is concentration-dependent. At a fixed concentration of IL-6R (25 ng/ml), we assessed the effects of IL-6 at 4 ng/ml and 80 ng/ml of IL-6 on IKr (Fig 1G). At +20 mV, 4 ng/ml of IL-6 reduced IKr peak densities by 21.9% (from 44.9&#177;4.43 pA/pF to 35.08&#177;5.71 pA/pF, n = 5, P>0.05, Fig 1G) and reduced IKr tail densities by 27.2% (from 66&#177;7.11 pA/pF to 48.04&#177;3.52 pA/pF, n = 5, *P<0.05, Fig 1G). Increasing IL-6 concentration to 80 ng/ml had a more pronounced effect such that at +20 mV, IKr peak densities were reduced by 65.3% (from 44.9&#177;4.43 pA/pF to 15.Y&#177;1.74 pA/pF, n = 13, *P<0.05, Fig 1G) and IKr tail densities were reduced by 72.8% (from 66&#177;7.11 pA/pF, to 17.93&#177;2.43 pA/pF, n = 13, *P<0.05, Fig 1G). Taken together our data demonstrate that IL-6 inhibition of IKr is concentration dependent.We next examined the effect of IL-6 and IL-6+IL-6R on the biophysical properties of IKr. First, we analyzed and compared the I-V relationships for activation measured during the depolarizing steps. IKr tail currents were normalized to the maximum current at +60 mV and plotted as a function of voltage (mV) and fitted to a Boltzmann equation to obtain activation curves (Fig 2A). IL-6 alone (Fig 2A), produced a small leftward shift in the midpoint of the steady-state activation (or V1/2) from -5.86&#177;2.45 mV (n = 21) to -10.75&#177;1.32 mV (n = 18, P>0.05), but produced a significant shift to -14.6&#177;2.11 mV (n = 9, *P<0.05, Fig 2A), in the presence of IL-6+IL-6R (Fig 2A) respectively.To determine the IKr activation time course (&#964;activation), the data were fitted with a single exponential function. IKr measured in HEK-hERG cells pretreated with IL-6 alone or IL-6+IL-6R produced faster activation kinetics (Fig 2B). At +20 mV, &#964;activation accelerated from 329&#177;52 ms (n = 21) to 219&#177;16 ms, (n = 18, *P<0.05) with IL-6 and to 103.2&#177;20.1 ms (n = 9, *P<0.05) in the presence of IL-6+IL-6R demonstrating that IL-6+IL-6R exert a profound effect on the activation kinetics of IKr. The next series of experiments examined the effects of IL-6 on the inactivation kinetics of IKr. A three-step protocol (Fig 2C) to isolate inactivating currents and determine the kinetics of inactivation was used [35&#8211;37]. hERG channels were activated by a 200 ms depolarizing step to +40 mV followed by a brief hyperpolarizing step to -120 mV for 10 ms to allow the channels to recover from inactivation. The hyperpolarizing step was followed by a step to various test potential from -40 mV to +60 mV. The estimated time constant of inactivation (&#964;inactivation) was measured by fitting the current traces to a single exponential. As illustrated in Fig 2, there was no significant difference in current traces and &#964;inactivation values obtained for basal IKr (Fig 2D), and currents measured in the presence of IL-6 alone (Fig 2E), or IL-6+IL-6R (Fig 2F) within the voltage range studied (Fig 2G).Next, we assessed whether IL-6 affected hERG expression in HEK-hERG cells. Western blot analysis was used to examine protein expression of hERG channels in control untreated cells and in cells pretreated for 40 minutes with IL-6 alone or IL-6+ILR. As illustrated in Fig 3A, (Lane 1), untreated control cells displayed bands at 150 kDa and 135 kDa, which are specific for the hERG channel. Cells pretreated with IL-6 (Fig 3A, Lane 2), or IL-6+IL-6R (Fig 3A, Lane 3), revealed reduced expression of the 150 kDa band. Average densitometry analysis demonstrated that IL-6 significantly reduced the 150 kDa expression by 16% (from 0.070&#177;0.000311 to 0.059&#177;0.000427, n = 5, *P<0.05, Fig 3B), and by 21% (from 0.070&#177;0.0001 to 0.055&#177;0.000427, *P<0.05) in the presence of IL-6R. Similarly, the 135 kDa band (Fig 3A) was reduced by IL-6 from 0.033&#177;0.0001 to 0.029&#177;0.0000424 (n = 5, Fig 3C, *P<0.05) and by IL-6+IL-6R to 0.029&#177;0.000015 (n = 5, Fig 3C, *P<0.05).\nIL-6 reduced \nThe results presented in Fig 1 show that inhibition of IKr by IL-6 is more profound with IL-6R. To investigate whether IL-6 acts on IKr via IL-6R in HEK-hERG cells, we incubated IL-6R (25 ng/ml) with an inhibitory mouse monoclonal anti-IL-6R antibody (20&#8211;100 &#956;g/ml, H-7: sc-373708, Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX, USA) for 40 minutes at room temperature. The mixture was then added to cells in combination with IL-6 (20 ng/ml) for 40 minutes before measuring IKr using the protocol shown in Fig 4A. Control IKr peak and tail currents measured in untreated HEK-hERG cells is shown in Fig 4B. In 4 separate experiments pre-treatment of cells with anti-IL-6R antibody (Fig 4C), completely prevented the inhibitory effects of IL-6 on IKr, but did not alter the currents when used alone (Data not shown). In the presence of anti-IL-6R antibody, IKr peak and tail current densities were 46.5&#177;8.44 pA/pF (n = 4, P>0.05, Fig 4E) and 67.6&#177;10.02 pA/pF (n = 4, P>0.05, Fig 4E) respectively, when compared to basal IKr. To investigate the involvement of Janus Kinase (JAK), we assessed IKr in the presence of IL-6+IL-6R in HEK-hERG cells pre-exposed to a JAK inhibitor-I (5 &#956;M) [38] for 30 minutes. Pre-treatment of cells with JAK inhibitor-I also prevented the inhibitory effect of IL-6 on IKr (Fig 4D). With JAK inhibitor-I, averaged IKr peak and tail current densities were 50.05&#177;8.81 pA/pF (n = 4, P>0.05, Fig 4E and 4F) and 65.46&#177;11.2 pA/pF (n = 4, P>0.05, Fig 4F) respectively and similar to control IKr peak (Fig 4E) and tail (Fig 4F) densities. Normalizing peak Itail curves to the maximal current at +60 mV obtained in the presence of anti-IL-6R antibody and JAK inhibitor-I revealed plots and V1/2 values that were like control (Fig 4E). V1/2 was -5.67&#177;1.33 mV (n = 4, P>0.05, and -3.46&#177;4.16 mV, n = 4, P>0.05) in the presence of anti-IL-6R antibody and JAK inhibitor-I respectively.\nIL-6 inhibits \nWe next assessed the effect of IL-6 on native IKr from AGPVM. This was investigated by using chromanol 293B (100 &#956;M) to block the slowly-activating delayed rectifier K current, IKs in addition to the use of a short-test depolarizing pulse protocol (200 ms, Fig 5A) during which a negligible amount of IKs will be activated, but allows a sufficient activation of a tail current upon repolarization which is largely due to slow deactivation of IKr [39]. In untreated myocytes, short depolarizing pulses evoked large outward deactivating tail currents (Fig 5B). Like the observations in HEK-hERG cells, IL-6 alone (Fig 5C) or IL-6+IL-6R (Fig 5D) significantly reduced currents at potentials positive to 10 mV. Compared to averaged control values (0.24&#177;0.02 pA/pF, n = 15, Fig 5E) measured at +20 mV, IKr current densities were reduced by 45.8% (or to 0.13&#177;0.02 pA/pF, n = 8 *P<0.05) in the presence of IL-6 alone, and by 58.3%, (0.10&#177;0.05 pA/pF, n = 5, *P<0.05) with IL-6+IL-6R. To test whether IL-6 exerted its inhibitory effect on IKr via IL-6R and downstream JAK signaling, experiments were performed in the presence of anti-IL-6R monoclonal antibody (100 &#956;g/ml), and JAK inhibitor-I (5 &#956;M) respectively. Compared to control IKr (Fig 5F), pretreatment with IL-6+IL-6R+anti-IL-6R antibody (Fig 5G) or IL6+IL-6R+JAK inhibitor-I (Fig 5H) abolished the inhibitory effects of IL-6+IL-6R (Fig 5I).We examined whether the endogenous IL-6R&#945; transcript and protein are expressed in guinea-pig heart using qRT-PCR and Western blots. Compared to control (water) (Lane 1), the results show that IL-6R is robustly expressed as a 120 bp band in both the atria (Lane 2) and ventricles (Lane 3, Fig 6A) in guinea-pig heart. Western blots of guinea pig ventricular cell lysates probed with anti-IL6R&#945; IL-6 antibody (H-7) further show that IL-6R&#945; protein expression which is manifested as an 80 kDa band (Fig 6B, lane 1) that was not seen when IL-6R&#945; antibody was pre-incubated with its own blocking peptide (Fig 6B, lane 2), in-line with reported data in rat heart [38].Furthermore, IL-6 did not have any measurable effects on the densities of the inwardly rectifying K current (IK1, Fig 7C) and voltage-gated Na current (INa, 7G) at all voltages tested (Fig 7D & 7H) demonstrating that the inhibition of IKr by IL-6 is specific and does not indiscriminately inhibit all currents.\nIL-6 regulates guinea-pig ERG expression in ventricular cardiomyocytes\nTo determine whether the effects of IL-6 on hERG channel expression observed in HEK-hERG cells are recapitulated in cardiomyocytes, we performed qRT-PCR and Western blot assays. IL-6 (20 ng/ml) significantly reduced transcript (Fig 8A) and protein expression of adult guinea pig ERG ventricular myocytes (Fig 8B&#8211;8D). Relative to control (or in the absence of IL-6), guinea pig ERG mRNA was significantly reduced by 48% (n = 3, *P<0.05). Guinea pig ERG protein expression quantified as the 150 kDa (Lane 1, Fig 8B) band is significantly reduced by 32% (or from 0.229&#177;0.002, n = 5, to 0.157&#177;0.00018, n = 5, *P<0.05), while the 135 kDa band (Lane 2, Fig 8B) is significantly reduced from 0.245&#177;0.000447 to 0.138&#177;0.000671 (or by 43.6%, n = 5, *P<0.05, Fig 8D).\nModulation of ventricular action potential duration by IL-6/IL-6R/JAK\nFinally, we examined the effect of IL-6/IL-6R on action potential duration measured in AGPVM. IL-6 significantly increased APD at 90% repolarization (APD90) from 310&#177;12.4 ms (Black trace), to 371&#177;13.9 ms (Red trace; 19%, n = 11, *P<0.05, Fig 8E and 8F), but had a more pronounced effect in the presence of IL-6R (Grey trace) as APD90 increased to 408&#177;27.8 ms (or by 32%, n = 14, *P0.05, Fig 8E) with JAK inhibitor and AG490 respectively.\nDiscussion\nAutoimmune inflammatory disorders are associated with an increased risk for QTc prolongation and TdP, thereby contributing to the incidence of SCD [15, 22]. Here, we show that IL-6 suppresses IKr in heterologous cells and myocytes resulting in prolonged APD. Furthermore, IL-6 also markedly blunted hERG/IKr channel mRNA and protein expression. To our knowledge, there have been no previous reports on IL-6 modulation of IKr in any cell type. Thus elevated IL-6 levels, reduced IKr and associated action potential prolongation described here may contribute to delayed repolarization and associated ventricular arrhythmias such as TdP reported in patients with autoimmune inflammatory disorders [22].\nComparison to previous studies on cytokines and cardiac \nAs pointed out above, there are no studies on the functional impact of IL-6 on hERG/IKr channel to date. However, and in support to this study, Wang et al [25] showed that another cytokine, TNF-&#945; reduced IHERG in HEK293 cells and IKr in dog ventricular myocytes. TNF-&#945; has also been shown to reduce Ito in rat ventricular myocytes [26, 27]. Similarly, IL-1&#946; inhibited Ito in mouse ventricular cardiomyocytes [30]. Therefore, taken together our data are consistent with the concept of modulation of cardiac K channels by cytokines.We also found that inhibition of IL-6R or JAK prevented the effects of IL-6 on IKr recorded in heterologous cells and myocytes indicating that the inhibitory effect of IL-6 on IKr involves IL-6R and gp130 downstream pathways. This is in line with previous reports that JAK is a downstream pathway of IL-6 via gp130 in cardiomyocytes [41]. Other studies demonstrated that excess levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines also play a role in causing LQT, possibly through mechanisms that involve reactive oxygen species [25, 26] and ceramide signaling pathway [42, 43]. Our findings reveal a novel and/or distinct IL-6/IL-6R-JAK-IKr signaling pathway involved in acquired LQT in inflammation.There have also been reports of cytokine&#8217;s effects on cardiac K channel subunit gene and protein expression with contradicting results. While Petkova-Kirova et al [29] and Fernandez-Velasco et al [26] reported reduced cardiac K channels protein expression with TNF-&#945;, Grandy & Fiset [44] reported no changes. In this study, IL-6 decreased expression of hERG proteins which occurred within 40 minutes suggesting that IL-6 alone or in combination with IL-6R may depress hERG expression by accelerating the channel turnover at multiple levels including at the transcriptional, translational as well as channel turnover at the cell-surface. Furthermore, in addition to significant inhibition in IKr current, we find that IL-6 pre-treated HEK-hERG cells displayed reduced ITails, a leftward shift in V1/2 of activation, and time-course of activation both of which were further pronounced in the presence of IL-6R. These mechanistic insights are likely to have important implications for predicting the functional impact of temporal changes in cytokine levels, functional expression of K channels, and cardiac repolarization. Therefore, the inhibitory effect of IL-6 on IKr can be attributed, at least in part, to both channel gating and protein trafficking.Previous studies have also shown reduced outward K currents and a prolonged APD in isolated myocytes incubated with TNF-&#945; [25, 26] or IL-1&#946; [30]. In contrast, Grandi and Fiset [44] showed that ventricular APD was not altered in TNF-&#945; treated mice, despite reduced Ito and IKur. Recently George et al [45] also demonstrated lack of a prolonged APD with TNF-&#945; in atrial myocytes isolated from adult guinea-pigs although voltage-gated K currents were not measured in these studies. However, APD prolongation and heart failure were reported by London et al [46] in transgenic mice overexpressing TNF-&#945; and by Wang et al [25] in dog ventricular myocytes. Therefore, one can speculate that our findings suggest that IL-6 may also be an important contributor to IKr reduction in heart failure [47].Finally, IL-6 is emerging as one of the relevant cytokines involved in the inflammatory process with cardiac electrophysiological consequences [5]. The physiological relevance of this study is underscored by focusing specifically on the individual effects of IL-6 on IKr channel function. This is an important step prior to identifying whether common mechanisms underlie the complex electrical remodeling process associated with the cumulative effects of inflammatory factors that occur during the complex process of cardiac and systemic inflammation that predispose to arrhythmic events. IL-6 inhibition has also been developed as a therapy for diseases associated with inflammation [48]. These efforts are likely to increase our understanding of how IL-6 and its inhibitors may affect cardiac electrical function. In this regard, the IL-6R inhibitor tocilizumab [49], which is widely used clinically to treat RA [50], may also have an emerging role as an anti-arrhythmic drug [9, 51].\nConclusion\nOverall, the present study is first to demonstrate that pathologically elevated IL-6 levels can negatively modulate IKr. Our findings are consistent with the notion that changes in IL-6 in individuals with systemic inflammation related to autoimmune disorders (but also possibly to infections or other inflammatory diseases) may display blunted IKr with serious implications for cardiac repolarization especially in the setting of other known classical risk factors including electrolytes imbalance, QTc prolonging medications, genetic and autoimmune channelopathies [22]. Our results predict specific inhibitors of IL-6R or cellular mediators that enhance channel opening to normalize IKr would be expected to correct QTc prolongation in patients. By providing the first measurements of the effect of IL-6 on hERG/IKr, we reveal that IKr is sensitive to pathological changes in cytokine levels in cardiac and systemic inflammation. Collectively our findings open new directions in determining the contribution of other downstream complex effectors (STAT3, MAPK, Pi3K/Akt) in IL-6-associated signaling pathways on IKr. This study was undertaken in both native guinea-pig ventricular myocytes and HEK293 cells stably expressing hERG/IKr, both of which exhibited similar findings. It will be interesting to confirm these outcomes in other system models such as human induced pluripotent cells-derived cardiomyocytes or in vivo animal models. Regardless, the data clearly show that IL-6 depresses IKr through IL-6R and JAK pathways, suggesting a novel cytokine mechanism in acquired inflammation induced LQTS.\nClinical perspectives\nPro-inflammatory IL-6 cytokine-mediated changes in cardiomyocyte ion channel function is a novel risk factor involved in the acquired inflammatory LQTS, a condition that underlies impaired repolarization, leading to ventricular arrhythmias and SCD. The translational implications are that patients with inflammatory disorders with high levels of IL-6 can benefit from routine ECG and counselling if other QTc prolonging risk factors are present in these patients.", "pmid": "30521586", "title": "Interleukin-6 inhibition of hERG underlies risk for acquired long QT in cardiac and systemic inflammation", "journal_title": "PLoS ONE", "authors": "Ademuyiwa S.

Currently, more than 14,000 new cases of colorectal cancer are diagnosed annually [1]. Serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) has been extensively used as a biomarker for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and yolk sac tumors [2, 3]. Elevated serum levels of AFP were also found in patients with carcinoma metastasis to the liver or non-neoplastic liver injury. Some studies have showed that the other tumors in human could also produce AFP, and gastric cancer was one of the most common [4]. Here, we report a rare case of colon cancer in a patient with an elevated serum AFP level. To the best of our knowledge, an elevated serum level of AFP resulting from colon adenocarcinoma with neuroendocrine differentiation has not been reported previously.\nCase presentation\nA 90-year-old woman presented to the emergency department at the local hospital having had an intermittent abdominal pain with poor appetite for 1&#160;week. Family history for colorectal cancer was negative.Preoperative imaging by abdominal computed tomography (CT) at the local hospital showed an annular tumor of 5.0&#8201;&#215;&#8201;4.5&#160;cm size in the ascending colon and wall thickening of the appendix, with peripheral fat stranding (Fig.&#160;1a, b). Ascending colon tumor with ruptured appendicitis was diagnosed. There were no hints for other distant metastases, as revealed by CT and chest X-ray. Laboratory studies showed a hemoglobin concentration of 6.8&#160;g/dL, WBC count of 15,300/&#956;L, platelet count of 412,000/&#956;L, and C-reactive protein level of 18.88&#160;mg/dL. Standard serum tumor marker carcinogenic antigen (CEA) and CA19-9 were found normal, but AFP was elevated (90.1&#160;ng/mL) according to a cutoff of 20&#160;ng/mL. The patient had received 5-day intravenous empirical antibiotics in the local hospital before admission.Fig. 1CT scans of the abdomen. An enhanced abdominal CT scan indicated wall thickening of the ascending colon, compatible with colon cancer (a, arrow), a swelling appendix with localized abscess, compatible with ruptured appendicitis (b, arrow), and regression of appendicular abscess after antibiotics treatment (c)After admission to our hospital, a series of survey was performed, including abdominal CT (Fig.&#160;1c). The general examination was unremarkable, but localized right lower quadrant abdominal tenderness, while laboratory studies showed a hemoglobin concentration of 9.8&#160;g/dL, WBC count of 8000/&#956;L, platelet count of 339,000/&#956;L, and C-reactive protein level of 2.76&#160;mg/dL. Renal and liver function tests were normal, and hepatitis B and C markers were negative. Serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and CA 19-9 levels were normal. However, AFP was still elevated (64.9&#160;ng/mL). After completing preoperative diagnostics, emergent laparoscopic surgery was performed showing a fungating tumor involving the proximal ascending colon and a localized abscess between the terminal ileum and cecum, compatible with ruptured appendicitis (Fig.&#160;2a, b). So, we performed laparoscopic right hemicolectomy with side-to-side anastomosis.Fig. 2Resected ascending tumor. Gross appearance of the ascending colon tumor and ruptured appendicitis (a, b)The pathological assessment of the resected specimen showed a 5&#8201;&#215;&#8201;4&#160;cm fungating tumor consisting of a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with neuroendocrine differentiation extending through the visceral peritoneum. Extramural vascular invasion of the adenocarcinoma cells was present. Microscopic evaluation of the 20 regional lymph nodes in the mesentery of the resected colon revealed four lymph nodes involvement. By immunohistochemistry, the cells were positive stained for CD20, CDX-2, synaptophysin, and negative for AFP, CD7, CD56, neuron-specific enolase, and chromogranin A. Morphologic and immunohistochemical findings confirmed the diagnosis of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with neuroendocrine differentiation within the ascending colon tumor and mesenteric lymph nodes. K-RAS and B-RAF genetic mutations were determined for primary tumor DNA after microdissection, and both genes were wild type. In summary, histological and immunohistochemical specifications finally revealed diagnosis of a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with neuroendocrine differentiation in the ascending colon and ruptured appendicitis. The final tumor stage was pT4aN2aM0, stage IIIc.In the postoperative course with the ordinary ward, recovery with oral feeding starting at the fourth postoperative day was uneventful, the patient could be sent home 11&#160;days after surgery. After discussion of this case in a multidisciplinary team treatment combined conference for colorectal cancer, the patient decided not to receive adjuvant chemotherapy because she was too weak to tolerate adjuvant chemotherapy. Interestingly, serum AFP level 1&#160;month after the surgery declined to 1.99&#160;ng/mL, used as tumor marker for recurrence. Other tumor markers (such as CEA and CA19-9) remained within the normal range during follow-up. Subsequent clinical and imaging follow-up revealed no signs of tumor recurrence up to now.\nDiscussion\nTo our knowledge, this report is the first case of a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with neuroendocrine differentiation in the colonic segment, combined with an elevated serum AFP level. Surgery is the only treatment that has the potential to cure patients with CRC. In our case, there were no histopathological features and patterns of immunoreactivity typically usually seen in hepatoid adenocarcinoma.In Taiwan, there is a large population of patients with hepatitis B or C virus infection. AFP is a tumor marker for HCC and had been used in the clinical practice for a long time. The high levels of AFP in this patient originally raised the question as to whether there was a tumor or another condition causing the expression of AFP. In our case, we performed CT image twice with no definite liver metastasis or hepatobiliary lesions.To date, there is only limited data on most tumor markers measured in neuroendocrine tumor (NET) patients, which has thus created uncertainty about their role. According to the WHO classification, adenocarcinoma with neuroendocrine differentiation is distinguished from neuroendocrine carcinoma by <30&#160;% of the neuroendocrine component [5]. Although overall AFP is elevated only in a minority of NET patient, this data analysis demonstrates the ability of AFP to highlight a group of NET patients with aggressive, high-grade tumors, and poor prognosis. Thus, AFP is likely to be a marker of tumor cell de-differentiation rather than a marker of hepatic metastases from NETs [3].This was important for diagnosis of hepatoid adenocarcinoma, including immunoreactive AFP in the cytoplasm of cells in the trabecular or solid nests. In the aspect of growth pattern, poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of solid type, small cell neuroendocrine cell carcinoma was similar to hepatoid adenocarcinoma. However, these tumors did not contain any cells positive for AFP, as our present case. Therefore, the diagnosis of hepatoid adenocarcinoma should be strictly based on combination of hepatoid features and AFP secretion.In SEER database, the prognosis of adenocarcinoma with neuroendocrine differentiation (>30&#160;% adenocarcinoma and <30&#160;% neuroendocrine component) was closer to neuroendocrine carcinoma than to non-neuroendocrine high-grade adenocarcinoma [6]. This subtype of CRC was thought as high recurrence rates, especially liver metastasis. Relatively poor survival in poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with neuroendocrine differentiation warrants studies of adjuvant systemic therapy. In our case, serum AFP levels were used as an indicator of therapeutic effectiveness and a marker for monitoring early recurrence and metastasis. The serum AFP levels apparently correlated with the tumor burden, and increasing AFP levels might give a warning for timely interventions.\nConclusions\nIn this study, we demonstrated a patient with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with neuroendocrine differentiation in the ascending colon, with an elevated serum AFP. After curative radical colectomy, AFP declined to normal range. AFP may be a useful tumor marker in poorly differentiated CRC with neuroendocrine component patients, for early detection of tumor recurrence.\nConsent\nWritten informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and accompanying images.", "pmid": "26976278", "title": "Elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein in poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with neuroendocrine differentiation of the ascending colon: a case report", "journal_title": "World Journal of Surgical Oncology", "authors": "Hung-Hsin Lin;Chia-Chu Chang;Shung-Haur Yang;Shih-Ching Chang;Wei-Shone Chen;Wen-Yih Liang;Jen-Kou Lin;Jeng-Kai Jiang", "doi": "10.1186/s12957-016-0838-0", "score": "0.0009480944"}, {"keywords": "inferior vena cava thrombosis;rivaroxaban;anticoagulation;bodybuilder", "abstract": "Inferior vena cava (IVC) thrombosis is very rare, particularly in the absence of an apparent congenital caval abnormality or hypercoagulable state.

The patient recovered successfully, and the IVC thrombus completely disappeared three months later. This case suggested that extrinsic compression of IVC by a tightened weightlifting belt around the abdomen is a triggering factor of IVC thrombosis, and rivaroxaban, a new oral anticoagulant, may be a useful option for treatment. ", "body": "Introduction\nInferior vena cava (IVC) thrombosis is an under-recognized entity that is associated with significant morbidity and mortality (1). It is estimated that 2.6-4.0% patients with lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) also have IVC thrombosis, whereas thrombus localized only in the IVC is extremely rare (2). IVC thrombosis is commonly associated with outflow obstruction of the IVC, such as that observed with Budd-Chiari syndrome, IVC anomalies, or as a result of external compression by a mass or hematoma (3). Various mechanisms for the origin of this condition have been suggested, particularly in athletes (4). In general, athletes are exposed to many thrombogenic risk factors, including hemoconcentration, trauma, immobilization, long-distance travel, and the use of oral contraceptives, but there is no well-established evidence or treatment (5).We herein report an unusual case of IVC thrombosis complicated with a pulmonary embolism in a 62-year-old male bodybuilder probably caused by extrinsic compression due to a weightlifting belt.\nCase Report\nA 62-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of worsening shortness of breath over a 2-week period. His dyspnea began suddenly while riding a bike, and he developed worsening shortness of breath. The patient denied recent trauma, surgery, immobilization, or a family history of thrombotic disorders. His only medication was ibuprofen, when needed. He had no abuse of anabolic steroids and supplements. He was a never-smoker and reported social consumption of alcohol. He reported doing daily physical exercise and had a history of performing excessive bodybuilding exercises using a weightlifting belt to prevent back injury while lifting heavy weights five days a week since his 30s. He trained one of five parts of his body (legs, chest, back, shoulders and arms) on each day of the week. His workout consisted mainly of a dumbbell or bench presses variation, sometimes with a machine press. His vital signs included blood pressure of 122/86 mmHg, heart rate of 74/min, and oxygen saturation of 95% (breathing room air). His body mass index and waist circumference were 25 kg/m2 (162 cm, 63 kg) and 76 cm, respectively. He had no signs of DVT, such as obvious edema, in his legs. Laboratory findings were ordinary, except for the levels of D-dimer products (11.8 &#956;g/mL). Levels of protein C, protein S, antithrombin III, and antiphospholipid antibodies were within normal limits. An electrocardiogram showed a T-wave inversion in the leads V1-3 and III. However, a transthoracic echocardiogram did not reveal any abnormalities. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed a thrombus in the right pulmonary artery and basal segmental branches (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, multiplanar reconstruction images revealed a 50&#215;25-mm mass-like thrombus localized at the distal site of IVC (Fig. 1B), and abdominal ultrasonography revealed a free-floating thrombus in IVC (Fig. 2). Contrast-enhanced computed tomography did not show data compatible with malignant pathology or an inflammatory process. Doppler ultrasonography of the lower extremities was performed with no evidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) visualized.Because of the vast and floating IVC thrombus at the infra-renal level, we decided to insert an IVC filter in the infra-renal IVC on the first day (before the administration of the anticoagulant). He was subsequently orally administered 15 mg of rivaroxaban twice daily for 21 days followed by 15 mg daily for maintenance treatment. He responded well to the new treatment with a significant reduction in dyspnea three days after the administration of rivaroxaban and was able to walk up the stairs without shortness of breath. After a month of treatment, follow-up abdominal CT showed a significant reduction in the thrombus, but a small residual thrombus remained. With no evidence of thrombus at the IVC filter, we attempted to remove the IVC filter. However, it proved impossible to snare the hook of the IVC filter at wall because of a tortuous IVC. He continued receiving rivaroxaban at 15 mg daily until the clinical follow-up 3 months after the development of IVC thrombus.At the 3-month follow-up, venous Doppler imaging of the IVC was performed, and the IVC thrombus had completely disappeared. An ultrasound compression test for the IVC was performed to clarify the impact of the weightlifting belt he used, which demonstrated an easily compressed IVC by the convex probe (Fig. 3). We then replicated situations using the weightlifting belt and not using it in order to examine how the weightlifting belt affected the IVC. Fig. 4 shows a comparison of the spectral Doppler waveforms obtained at the level of his right common femoral vein with and without the weightlifting belt. When using the weightlifting belt, a more decreased forward flow was observed compared to not using the weightlifting belt, which was an indirect sign of central venous stenosis. He finished a 6-month course of rivaroxaban therapy while refraining from using the weightlifting belt, and the IVC thrombus was successfully treated based on the findings of repeated venous Doppler imaging of the IVC, which remained negative for thrombosis (Fig. 5).\nDiscussion\nLocalized thrombosis of IVC is an extremely rare condition in otherwise healthy adults (2,6). Because it is a rare entity, the definitive mechanism of thrombosis and its treatment remain unclear. The patient in our case study had no malignancy, trauma, hematologic abnormality, or a history of surgery. However, data are insufficient to claim that the etiology is &#8220;unknown&#8221;, as this is an extremely rare condition. The risk factors for thromboembolism are well known, and athletes are placed under conditions, such as travel, trauma, immobilization, hemoconcentration, and polycythemia, that can result in exposure to several of these factors (5).If the pathogenesis of IVC thrombosis in the present case is to be attributed to him being a bodybuilder, some essential aspects need to be considered, including steroid use. Johannesdottir et al. examined the association between the use of glucocorticoids and the risk of VTE and found that current glucocorticoid use is associated with a more than two-fold increase in VTE compared with that in non-users (7). In this case, steroid use was not evident, so different mechanisms of bodybuilder-related thrombosis are assumed to have been involved. Another possible cause of the IVC thrombosis in this bodybuilder is the use of a weightlifting belt. Weightlifting belts are commercially marketed with the aim of preventing back injuries while lifting heavy objects. It is thought that they work by helping support and stabilize the spine. However, they may also affect the intra-abdominal pressure while tightening the intra-abdominal organs significantly (8).Because our patient's IVC was easily compressed by a probe, we considered the mechanism for IVC thrombosis to have been due to his use of a weightlifting belt. Caval flow stasis caused by compression with a weightlifting belt from the outside of the body leads to thrombosis, similar to the so-called venous compression syndromes reported by Butros et al. (9,10). Venous compression syndromes are caused by an extrinsic mass effect on a vein by adjacent structures, such as arteries, bones, muscles, or ligaments. In a narrow and confined anatomical space, the otherwise morphologically normal vein becomes trapped between rigid or semi-rigid surfaces (11,12). In this case, we assumed that the weightlifting belt might compartmentalize IVC combined with his developed inner muscle such as psoas muscle.Given the rarity of the disease, there is no evidence-based approach for its management. In the present case, the patient had a large floating thrombus in the IVC complicated by a hemodynamically stable PTE. We inserted an IVC filter the day before the administration of a new anticoagulant. We did not opt for the surgical approach, as IVC thrombectomy is an invasive surgery that requires direct caval venotomy or temporary groin arteriovenous fistula creation and does not allow the concomitant treatment of residual stenosis after thrombectomy (13,14). Therefore, this modality has fallen out of favor and is now limited to patients with tumor-associated thrombus (1,15).Anticoagulants are the gold standard of treatment for patients with IVC thrombosis, but there are no specific recommendations guiding the anticoagulant management in patients. Furthermore, the use of newer anticoagulants remains a challenge. There has only been 1 case report of a 52-year-old man who was successfully treated with rivaroxaban for IVC thrombosis provoked by multiple traumatic injuries (16). The EINSTEIN study showed that oral rivaroxaban was not inferior to warfarin therapy in the treatment of VTE (17). However, the study was based on VTE study data in the general VTE population, and whether or not direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are effective options for IVC thrombosis is unclear, as the study did not specify whether patients with IVC thrombosis were included. The advantages of DOACs over warfarin include a lower incidence of significant bleeding, convenience of use, minor drug and food interactions, predictable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic, rapid onset and offset of action, short half-life, and no need for laboratory monitoring (18). Further case series and clinical studies are needed to guide the use of DOACs for IVC thrombosis.\nConclusion\nThis case is of interest because IVC thrombosis is rare compared with lower-extremity DVT, particularly localized and mass-like IVC thrombosis. IVC thrombosis has been associated with several factors in the daily life of athletes. Extrinsic compression from outside the body, such as weightlifting belts, may have been an important triggering factor. DOACs with and without an IVC filter may be a useful initial option if a thrombosis is localized in the IVC.\nNone\nThe authors state that they have no Conflict of Interest (COI).", "pmid": "29709932", "title": "An Unusual Case of Inferior Vena Cava Thrombosis in a Healthy Male Bodybuilder", "journal_title": "Internal Medicine", "authors": "Junichi Imanishi;Michiko Iseri;Masahiro Motoki;Sachiko Yoshikawa;Naohiko Sone;Tomoyuki Honjo;Kohei Kamemura;Kenji Kaihotsu;Masanori Iwahashi", "doi": "10.2169/internalmedicine.0377-17", "score": "0.0005495588"}, {"keywords": "multiple sclerosis;fatigue;tDCS;non-invasive brain stimulation;network", "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic progressive inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS) and the major cause of non-traumatic disability in young adults.

Its estimated prevalence in Europe is 83 per 100,000, with rates being approximately twice as high for women as for men and lower in the southern than in the northern European countries (Pugliatti et al., 2006).The precise etiology of MS remains obscure and involves a plethora of mechanisms. Its clinical course is highly heterogeneous, during which patients may develop various motor, sensory, cognitive, and behavioral symptoms. The available treatments consist of the disease-modifying therapies (such as the immunosuppressants, immunomodulators, and monoclonal antibodies) (Wingerchuk and Carter, 2014); in addition to several symptomatic treatments that are usually prescribed to control disorders of strength, sensation, mood, sleep, etc.Among the frequently encountered symptoms in MS, fatigue remains the most challenging one, majorly altering the quality of life (Krupp et al., 1988; Janardhan and Bakshi, 2002; Merkelbach et al., 2002; Giovannoni, 2006; Induruwa et al., 2012). Indeed, it affects up to 75% of MS patients at some point in their disease course (Bakshi et al., 2000; Lerdal et al., 2007; Kos et al., 2008), gets exacerbated during the day (Comi et al., 2001; Morris et al., 2002; Mills and Young, 2008; Krupp et al., 2010), and increases with hot and humid environment (Bakshi, 2003; Bol et al., 2012; Leavitt et al., 2012).Although fatigue is reported by the majority of individuals as their most common and disabling symptom (Krupp et al., 1989, 2010; Fisk et al., 1994a,b; Colosimo et al., 1995; Bakshi, 2003; Lobentanz et al., 2004; Flensner et al., 2008), no clear definition exists in the literature; which makes it at a time hard to be described by patients and diagnosed by physicians. Such a difficulty is further exacerbated by the diversity of the fatigue assessment tools employed by scientists and researchers. In the majority of cases, fatigue is self-reported using various subjective scales, like Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) or Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS), among others.From an etiological perspective, no single mechanism accounts for its occurrence, and MS fatigue is rather seen as a complex and multifactorial constellation (Bakshi, 2003; MacAllister and Krupp, 2005; Kos et al., 2008; Braley and Chervin, 2010; Krupp et al., 2010; Vucic et al., 2010; Induruwa et al., 2012). In an attempt to account for its origin, many hypotheses have been raised and include the processes of demyelination and axonal loss that involve various cortical and subcortical regions; the neuroimmune dysregulation supported by the elevated levels of cytokines and other inflammatory mediators encountered in MS patients; and the neuroendocrine dysfunction along the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, among others.Facing this reality, various pharmacological (dopaminergic drugs, psychostimulants, etc.) and alternative interventions (aerobic exercises, cooling therapies, psychotherapies, etc.) have been tried but only resulted in limited benefits (Vucic et al., 2010; Induruwa et al., 2012). Nowadays, non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques have gained an important interest in the treatment of many neuropsychiatric disorders; hence, they might be of some help in terms of MS fatigue.In this review, we will first revisit the definition of this symptom, summarize its various types, and shed the light on the central fatigue encountered in MS patients; a particular emphasis will be given to the available data regarding the proposed fatigue networks. A final part will be dedicated to the NIBS techniques and their possible mechanisms in this context. The pharmacological and other alternative therapies are beyond the scope of this work (For reviews see Vucic et al., 2010; Induruwa et al., 2012).\nMultiple sclerosis fatigue\nTo start, the definition of fatigue differs widely among patients, researchers, and physicians. From the patients' perspective, fatigue is usually reported as &#8220;excessive tiredness,&#8221; &#8220;malaise,&#8221; or &#8220;weakness&#8221; (Krupp, 2003). As for researchers and physicians, the definition varied among the available data. For instance, Wessely observed the fatigue in terms of its origin and referred to it as having its source at the level of the upper motor neuron or above (Wessely, 1998). Gandevia et al. defined it as a progressive exercise-induced reduction in voluntary activation of a muscle (Gandevia, 2001). Chaudhuri and Behan considered it a failure to initiate and/or sustain attention tasks and physical activities requiring self-motivation in the absence or not related to physical or cognitive dysfunction (Chaudhuri and Behan, 2000). Other authors described it as a subjective lack of physical and/or mental energy (Benedict et al., 2005). Interestingly, a medical definition of fatigue was proposed in one study which consisted of a qualitative phase followed by a cross-sectional questionnaire survey in 40 MS patients (Mills and Young, 2008). Here, the symptom was defined as a reversible motor and cognitive impairment, with a reduced motivation and an increased desire to rest. It can occur either spontaneously or following various factors such as mental or physical activity, humidity, infections, and food ingestion.Second, fatigue encountered in MS patients is commonly classified into a &#8220;primary&#8221; fatigue related to the CNS pathological changes in the context of the disease itself; and a &#8220;secondary&#8221; fatigue attributed to MS-related comorbidities. This includes weakness that can mimic fatigue (van der Werf et al., 1998), mood and sleep disorders (M&#246;ller et al., 1994; Induruwa et al., 2012), and medications side effects (Braley and Chervin, 2010). It is noteworthy that disease-modifying therapies themselves could have some impact on MS fatigue. For instance, MS patients treated with Interferon-beta can experience fatigue (Braley and Chervin, 2010). Conversely, the monoclonal antibody Natalizumab could reduce fatigue, as shown in TYNERGY trial (For reviews see Hoepner et al., 2014).Primary fatigue results from a spectrum where one pole is the inability to generate the force required to perform the task due to a failure of force production at the muscle level (&#8220;peripheral fatigue&#8221;); and the other pole is the inability to sustain the required neural drive to muscle because of supraspinal, spinal, and even peripheral nerve contribution (&#8220;central fatigue&#8221;) (Gandevia, 2001; Zwarts et al., 2008). Interestingly, &#8220;central fatigue&#8221; can be the result of both cognitive and physical exertion (Claros-Salinas et al., 2013) and can reflect either a subjective sensation (fatigue) or an objective change in performance (fatigability) (Kluger et al., 2013).Another way to perceive MS fatigue consists of differentiating &#8220;trait&#8221; from &#8220;state&#8221; fatigue. The &#8220;trait&#8221; fatigue was the focus of several papers and was defined as a stable state that expresses the global status of patients, which does not significantly change over time, and usually assessed with fatigue scales (Sepulcre et al., 2009; Calabrese et al., 2010; Genova et al., 2013). In contrast, &#8220;state&#8221; fatigue was the subject of few works only; it is a transient condition characterized by a decreased performance during an acute but sustained effort (DeLuca et al., 2008; Genova et al., 2013). In addition, it can fluctuate in response to external and internal factors, and is usually tested during task performance.\nMS fatigue, disability, and disease duration\nMost of the studies that investigated MS fatigue aimed to understand the contributory role of clinical, demographic and neuroimaging data. In this perspective, conflicting data were found regarding the relationship between fatigue severity and the level of physical disability. Although many studies have established a positive correlation between fatigue scores and the degree of physical disability based on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) (Colosimo et al., 1995; van der Werf et al., 1998; Flachenecker et al., 2002; Niepel et al., 2006; Pellicano et al., 2010), others have either found a weak association (Ford et al., 1998; Pittion-Vouyovitch et al., 2006; Yaldizli et al., 2011), or failed to detect any relationship (Krupp et al., 1988; Roelcke et al., 1997; Sheean et al., 1997; Provinciali et al., 1999; Rocca et al., 2009; Cruz G&#243;mez et al., 2013; Derache et al., 2013; Gobbi et al., 2014a; Hesse et al., 2014). Such findings might be related to the multi-component aspect of this symptom and/or the differences among these studies in terms of sample size, recruited MS subtypes, EDSS cut-offs, and the subjective tools used for reporting fatigue. Furthermore, the majority of the studies could not correlate fatigue scores with disease duration (Roelcke et al., 1997; Bakshi et al., 1999; Niepel et al., 2006; Pellicano et al., 2010; Gold et al., 2011; Yaldizli et al., 2011; Derache et al., 2013).Admitting this apparent occurrence of fatigue independently from disease duration and disability progression, there is a growing interest in understanding the radiological and neurophysiological underpinnings of MS fatigue.\nNeural correlates of MS fatigue\n\nImpact of white matter and gray matter abnormalities\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies revealed controversial data regarding the relationship between fatigue severity and each of the brain atrophy and lesion load. While some studies of them have yielded positive associations, others failed to detect any relationship. The latter finding may be attributed in part to the small sample size selected in some of these studies, and to the cross-sectional or short-term longitudinal follow up design adopted by most of them. A summary is available in Table 1.Interestingly, a large number of works have succeeded in establishing a link between fatigue scores and gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) abnormalities in specific cortical and subcortical regions that were proposed to be major components of the MS fatigue networks. Such networks will constitute the main scope of this section.\nAnatomical correlates of MS fatigue\n\nThe fronto-striatal network\nAmong the early evidences of cortico-subcortical circuit dysfunction as a substrate for MS fatigue, the involvement of a &#8220;fronto-striatal network&#8221; was highlighted by two studies. In the first one, fatigued MS (F-MS) patients had a predominant reduced cerebral metabolic rate of glucose in the frontal lobe and basal ganglia (Roelcke et al., 1997); FSS scores were inversely correlated with such a rate in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). In line with these results, Pardini et al. reported a significant association between MFIS scores and a cluster of voxels located in the left frontal WM, which was further found to be involved in the fronto-striatal network, among others (Pardini et al., 2010). In a third study, MS patients underwent functional MRI (fMRI) during the performance of a single motor task using the right hand (Specogna et al., 2012). Compared to non-fatigued MS (NF-MS) patients, F-MS patients had a greater activation of the premotor area ipsilateral to the movement, the right putamen, and the right DLPFC. Conversely, Codella et al. failed to demonstrate a difference in fronto-striatal GM pathology between F-MS and NF-MS patients, or a correlation between such findings and FSS scores. These results could be partially attributed to the small sample size (Codella et al., 2002b). Table 2 provides a summary of the abovementioned studies.\nThe parieto-striatal network\nA parieto-striatal network was the object of one MRI study involving 15 F-MS and 15 NF-MS patients. A significant association was found between fatigue scores and the lesion load in the parietal lobe, internal capsule, and periventricular trigone, emphasizing the role of this network in MS fatigue (Colombo et al., 2000).\nDeep gray matter substrates\nA group of authors correlated MS fatigue with isolated deep GM pathologies. One study assessed the involvement of caudate, putamen, and thalamus based on the mean T1 relaxation time (Niepel et al., 2006), an MRI parameter previously found to correlate with the degree of disability in MS patients (Parry et al., 2002). Compared to their non-fatigued counterparts, F-MS patients had significantly higher median T1 values in the thalami, which were significantly correlated to FSS scores. The thalamic nuclei represent an essential relay center in information integration, the dysfunction of which might contribute to fatigue. Another work employed the proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy to study the relationship between fatigue scores and the N-acetyl aspartate to creatinine ratio (NAA/cr), a neural marker of axonal damage, within the frontal cortex and basal ganglia (T&#233;llez et al., 2008). A correlation was only found between the physical domain of MFIS and NAA/cr within the lentiform nucleus complex. A third study assessed the perfusion parameters of deep GM and MS fatigue based on the multidimensional fatigue inventory (MFI) (Inglese et al., 2007). An association was found between MFI scores and the cerebral blood volume and flow in the thalamus and basal ganglia (for a summary, see Table 3).It is important to note that the difference in the fatigue scales among these three studies might be behind the minor variation in the results. In fact, the 7-item FSS has some limitations due to its classic ordinal construct (Krupp et al., 1988); the 21-item MFIS is a modified version of the original fatigue impact scale (FIS) that explores the physical, psychosocial and cognitive domains of fatigue (Fisk et al., 1994a,b); and the 20-item MFI employed in the last study evaluates five fatigue dimensions, namely the general, physical and mental fatigue along with the reduced motivation and activity (Smets et al., 1995).\nCortico-cortical networks\nAmong the works dedicated to MS fatigue, some attention was paid on the pathological changes affecting the cortico-cortical networks, particularly those involving the frontal and parietal cortices. In this setting, six studies were found to fulfill these criteria. In one study, electroencephalography (EEG) recording were performed during and following the performance of a simple motor task (Leocani et al., 2001). Compared to NF-MS patients and healthy controls, F-MS patients had higher event-related desynchronization (ERD) over the midline frontal structures during the movement and lower event-related synchronization (ERS) in the contralateral central area after the movement (Leocani et al., 2001). These are the respective markers of cortical activation and idling. Therefore, this altered balance between excitation (ERD) and inhibition (ERS) might result from axonal damage and the subsequent loss of functional intra-cortical connections. The post-movement loss of inhibition (ERS) seems to trigger brain activation and might account for MS fatigue. Tartaglia et al. found that, during the performance of a fatiguing cognitive task, MS patients exhibited an altered pattern of activation within the left primary sensory and premotor cortices and the supplementary motor area, despite the lack of performance difference in comparison to the healthy group (Tartaglia et al., 2008). In another study, fatigue was significantly correlated with frontal GM atrophy especially involving the superior frontal gyrus (SFG) on the left and the middle frontal gyrus (MFG) bilaterally, and with lesion load namely found within the left frontal and right parieto-temporal areas (Sepulcre et al., 2009). In addition, using DTI-based tractography, one study established a correlation between fatigue scores and a significant cluster of voxels in the deep WM involving fronto-frontal fibers, among others (Pardini et al., 2010). It is noteworthy that fatigue scores were frequently found to correlate with isolated regional metabolic changes in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) (Pellicano et al., 2010), left precentral gyrus (Riccitelli et al., 2011), bilateral frontal cortices (Huolman et al., 2011), left superior frontal and right inferior temporal gyri (Rocca et al., 2014), and left supplementary motor area (Cruz G&#243;mez et al., 2013). Other studies reported an association between fatigue and abnormalities involving the corpus callosum and its radiating fibers that primarily ensure the interhemispheric cortico-cortical connections (Yaldizli et al., 2011, 2014; Gobbi et al., 2014b; Rocca et al., 2014). The above-mentioned papers are summarized in Table 4.\nThe cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical loop\nConsidering this bunch of evidence involving various brain areas and admitting the heterogeneous nature of MS, a large neural network should be considered in the context of MS fatigue.First, using morphological MRI, one study has found that F-MS patients had atrophy in the striatum, thalamus, SFG, and intraparietal gyrus (IPG). Correlations were observed between MFIS cognitive subscale and each of the striatal volume, and the cortical thickness of the PPC and the MFG. The MFIS physical subscale was also correlated with the striatal volume and SFG cortical thickness (Calabrese et al., 2010). Andreasen et al. used DTI and magnetization transfer imaging to study the central motor drive during isometric contraction (Andreasen et al., 2010). They found that F-MS patients had regional atrophy in the DLPFC, PPC, and basal ganglia. However, no correlation was found between these atrophies and FSS scores, a finding that might be attributed to the small sample.Data from fMRI studies have documented an altered pattern of regional activation and functional connectivity (FC) in F-MS patients at rest or during the performance of fatiguing motor and cognitive tasks. In one study, F-MS patients showed hypoactivation within the ipsilateral rolandic operculum and precuneus, as well as the contralateral thalamus and MFG. FSS scores were inversely correlated with the activation pattern of the contralateral thalamus and the ispsilateral rolandic operculum (Filippi et al., 2002). A second work compared the brain activation pattern of fatigable and non-fatigable MS patients following interferon injection (Rocca et al., 2007). Following the injection, fatigable patients showed increased activation of the basal ganglia, thalami, primary sensorimotor cortex, supplementary motor area, and several frontal regions. In a third study, kinematic and fMRI data were obtained from healthy controls, F-MS and NF-MS patients. Compared to the other groups, F-MS patients had an increased activation of the left secondary somatosensory cortex and the right precuneus and decreased activation of the right thalamus, right basal ganglia, left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) during in-phase and anti-phase movements (Rocca et al., 2009). Here, the fatigue effect was mainly located in fronto-parietal regions including the left IFG, and left postcentral gyrus, among others. A fourth study found an association between mental fatigue and hyperactivation in the fronto-parietal regions, basal ganglia, and thalamus (DeLuca et al., 2008).It is worth noting that two other works focused on the brain activation patterns and FC during the performance of a mentally fatiguing cognitive task. In the first study, MS patients had stronger cortico-cortical and subcortico-subcortical FC and weaker cortico-subcortical FC between the left PPC and the right caudate head compared to healthy controls (Engstr&#246;m et al., 2013). Here, MS fatigue was significantly correlated with the right substantia nigra (SN) activation and marginally with the left PPC activation; the reported activation pattern within the SN might have increased the thalamic inhibition and accounted for MS fatigue. In the other study, MS patients had hyperactivation of the caudate nucleus which was associated with state fatigue (Genova et al., 2013). In the same work, the authors used DTI and demonstrated a correlation between FSS scores and reduced fraction anisotropy (FA) in the anterior internal capsule, a structure having connections with the caudate nucleus and the thalamus. These findings support the role of the &#8220;striatal-thalamic-frontal&#8221; system in MS fatigue (Genova et al., 2013).In addition, Derache et al. found that their F-MS cohort had a significant reduction of GM density in clusters, some of which are located in the bilateral frontal cortex and in the left parietal cortex. Fatigue scores were negatively correlated with each of GM density in the same involved fronto-parietal areas, the GM density in bilateral thalamus and the rest central glucose metabolic rate within the basal ganglia (Derache et al., 2013). Finally, in a resting-state (rs) fMRI study conducted by Finke et al. fatigue severity was negatively correlated with the FC between the basal ganglia and the medial prefrontal gyrus (PFG), precuneus, and posterior cingulate cortex; and positively with the FC between the caudate nucleus and the motor cortex (Finke et al., 2014).To sum up, these studies altogether support the existence of a cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical loop as a neural correlate of MS fatigue. The latter seems to englobe motor and non-motor circuits acting together to induce the symptom in question (Table 5).\nOther neural correlates\nApart from the above-discussed circuits, a number of reports have linked MS fatigue to other cerebral structures. For instance, one study has found an association between MS fatigue and an altered integrity of the fibers that connect the posterior hypothalamus and the mesencephalon (Hanken et al., 2015). This was in line with two previous works. In the first one, F-MS patients exhibited a higher activity of the HPA axis than those without fatigue (Gottschalk et al., 2005). As for the second one, FSS scores were positively correlated with the T1 relaxation time values within the hypothalamus of MS patients (Zellini et al., 2009).To note, other neural correlates were associated with fatigue, and include the cerebellum (Roelcke et al., 1997; Filippi et al., 2002; Rocca et al., 2009), the cingulate cortex (Roelcke et al., 1997; Filippi et al., 2002; Rocca et al., 2007; Tartaglia et al., 2008; Sepulcre et al., 2009; Andreasen et al., 2010; Finke et al., 2014; Pardini et al., 2015), the right anterior thalamic radiations (Bester et al., 2013; Gobbi et al., 2014b; Rocca et al., 2014), and the nucleus accumbens (Rocca et al., 2014), among others.\nNeuro-immune correlates of MS fatigue\nImmunological factors have long been recognized as key factors in the pathophysiology of MS (Rovaris et al., 1996; Khademi et al., 2000; Baraczka et al., 2003). Hence, several studies have looked at the potential role of the inflammatory cytokines in MS fatigue. Interestingly, a significant correlation was found between the level of response to Amantadine and Pemoline -pharmacological treatments of fatigue- and the reduction in serum levels of interleukin 1-beta (IL-1&#946;) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) in MS patients (Bertolone et al., 1993). Furthermore, the median levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#945;) mRNA expression and the serum levels of TNF-&#945; and interferon gamma (IFN-&#947;) were found to be significantly higher in F-MS patients than in NF ones (Flachenecker et al., 2004; Heesen et al., 2006; Pokryszko-Dragan et al., 2012). Additionally, a positive relationship was found between IL-6 serum levels and fatigue scores in MS patients (Malekzadeh et al., 2015). Moreover, a higher frequency of cytokine producing CD8+ T cells was found among MS patients and was the only significant predictor of fatigue scores (Gold et al., 2011).All these studies hint toward the role of inflammation in inducing MS fatigue, which might be of potential interest for future targeted therapies.\nNIBS and MS fatigue\nVarious pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions have been tried to treat MS fatigue, but showed limited benefits and multiple side effects (Induruwa et al., 2012; Khan et al., 2014). As discussed above, neuroimaging studies have focused on the neural network changes underlying MS fatigue. Hence, acting on these networks could be of particular help in the management of such a debilitating symptom, and thereby would support the use of NIBS in this context.\nNIBS principles\nThere is a growing interest in studying the therapeutic effects of NIBS techniques in neurological or psychiatric diseases (Lefaucheur et al., 2014). These techniques include repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS).rTMS consists of a transcranial delivery of an electromagnetic field via a stimulation coil localized on the patient's scalp. This results in an intracortical current that is strong enough to trigger action potentials (APs) (Lefaucheur, 2012). rTMS mainly acts by modifying the cortical excitability, which majorly depends on the stimulation frequency. It was shown that low frequencies (5 Hz) have respectively inhibitory and excitatory effects (Pascual-Leone et al., 1994). Over the last few years, rTMS has gained special interest in the management of MS symptoms. For instance, rTMS over the motor cortex was shown to provide beneficial effects on spasticity (Centonze et al., 2007a), lower urinary tract (LUT) symptoms (Centonze et al., 2007b), and hand dexterity (Koch et al., 2008) in MS patients. Furthermore, intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) -a variant of TMS- ameliorated MS spasticity (Mori et al., 2010a,b) and primed the exercise effect in MS patients (Mori et al., 2011).As for tDCS, the idea of using electrical current stimulation to modulate brain function dates back to more than 200 years (Priori, 2003; Zago et al., 2008). Data from animal studies revealed that weak direct currents delivered by intracerebral or epidural electrodes were able to modify cortical excitability, an effect that remains stable long after the end of stimulation. In the last few decades, tDCS showed its reliability in changing human cortical function by inducing focal, prolonged yet reversible shifts in cortical excitability (Priori et al., 1998; Nitsche and Paulus, 2000, 2001; Nitsche et al., 2003; Priori, 2003). The technique consists of localizing two electrodes over the scalp, an anode and a cathode, in order to act on various neural circuits. The exposed tissue is polarized and tDCS modifies spontaneous neuronal excitability by a tonic depolarization or hyperpolarization of resting membrane potential, obtained respectively by performing anodal or cathodal tDCS (Creutzfeldt et al., 1962; Purpura and McMurtry, 1965; Nitsche and Paulus, 2011; Paulus et al., 2013; Filmer et al., 2014). tDCS effects depend on several parameters including the electrodes size, type, polarity, and position as well as the current strength and shape, and the stimulation duration (Purpura and McMurtry, 1965; Nitsche and Fregni, 2007; Nitsche et al., 2008).Moreover, tDCS appears to be an NIBS technique with a good safety profile, easy implementation, good patients' tolerance and little or no adverse effects (Poreisz et al., 2007; Nitsche et al., 2008; Brunoni et al., 2012). In addition, compared to rTMS, placebo-controlled studies are easier to be performed with tDCS since real and sham stimulations are quite indistinguishable (Gandiga et al., 2006). For all these reasons, tDCS would be an important therapeutic modality for cortical dysfunction (Been et al., 2007) constituting an interesting option in the management of MS symptoms, notably fatigue.Before reviewing NIBS data in terms of MS fatigue, we will present the various aspects that support the specific interest of tDCS use to treat MS-related brain dysfunction.\nSpecific interests of tDCS in the management of MS-related disorders\n\ntDCS and brain functional connectivity\nThe modulatory effects of tDCS in terms of the rs-FC of various networks have been supported by numerous fMRI and MRS studies. For instance, anodal tDCS over the left DLPFC increased its connectivity with the right hemisphere (Park et al., 2013) and modified the rs-FC in the fronto-parietal networks (Keeser et al., 2011). In addition, the tDCS effects on brain networks connectivity were demonstrated following motor cortex, left and right inferior frontal gyri (IFG) stimulation. Anodal stimulation of the former would lead to FC changes some of which occur within the cortico-striatal and thalamo-cortical circuits (Polan&#237;a et al., 2011a,b, 2012a,b; Sehm et al., 2012, 2013; Amadi et al., 2013; Khan et al., 2013; Lindenberg et al., 2013). Furthermore, acting on the left or right IFG had an important impact on the rs-FC of the language network (Meinzer et al., 2012, 2013; Rosso et al., 2014).Therefore, based on these data, tDCS might be beneficial in modulating MS-fatigue networks and restoring brain FC through several potential mechanisms.\ntDCS, conduction failure, and axonal degeneration\nMajor changes in axonal conduction occur in MS as a result of the inflammatory demyelinating processes and the oxidative stress. First, among the inflammatory mediators, nitric oxide can cause a depolarizing conduction block (Redford et al., 1997; Shrager et al., 1998) which may occur through the activation of persistent Na+ channels and the subsequent increase in intracellular Na+; or by causing a mitochondrial dysfunction and axonal ATP depletion (Bolanos et al., 1997). The latter can explain the documented Na+/K+ ATPase failure (Dutta et al., 2006; Waxman, 2006; Mahad et al., 2008) and the reverse action of Na+&#8211;Ca2+ exchanger, leading to intraaxonal calcium level increase, activation of Ca2+-dependent apoptosis and axonal degeneration (Bechtold and Smith, 2005; Stys, 2005; Gonsette, 2008). Interestingly, one study has shown that tDCS might act on these mechanisms by modulating the activity of Na+ and Ca2+ channels (Nitsche et al., 2003). Furthermore, in the rat model of Parkinson disease, tDCS was able to reduce the oxidative stress, which resulted in a cognitive improvement (Lu et al., 2015). Hence, anodal tDCS might enhance axonal conduction along the demyelinated segments through a subthreshold polarizing effect. This might be used to improve MS fatigue.Beyond demyelination, MS can lead to axonal degeneration, associated with irreversible deficits. Notably, two recent animal studies have documented a positive effect of tDCS on the activation and migration of neural stem cells (Rueger et al., 2012; Keuters et al., 2015). Therefore, tDCS could be helpful in promoting the regeneration processes and ameliorating various MS symptoms in the course of the disease.\ntDCS and inflammation-induced synaptopathy\nInflammation-induced synaptopathy is the link between inflammation and neurodegeneration, as shown in the animal model of MS. Inflammation might limit the plastic compensatory protective changes in neural networks, which can be the route by which CNS confined inflammation shifts into irreversible neurodegenerative disorders (Centonze et al., 2010). Glutamate is a major excitatory neurotransmitter of the CNS, importantly involved in MS neurodegenerative damage (Srinivasan et al., 2005; Cianfoni et al., 2007). Altered glutamate metabolism and the subsequent abnormal intracellular ion accumulation can lead to excitotoxic neuronal damage (Forder and Tymianski, 2009). MS patients were found to have increased CSF levels of glutamate (Stover et al., 1997; Sarchielli et al., 2003; Srinivasan et al., 2005; Cianfoni et al., 2007), upregulation of glutamate receptors (Newcombe et al., 2008), and altered expression of glutamate transporters (Geurts et al., 2003, 2005; Vallejo-Illarramendi et al., 2006).In addition, inflammation-dependent activation of the microglia is associated with the release of TNF-&#945;, IFN-&#947;, and IL-1&#946; (Block and Hong, 2005; Kawanokuchi et al., 2006; Schwartz et al., 2006; Muzio et al., 2007), which can enhance the excitatory synaptic transmission (Stellwagen et al., 2005; Lai et al., 2006; Mizuno et al., 2008), and downregulate the inhibitory Gamma Amino-Butyric acid (GABA) transmission (Stellwagen et al., 2005). These facts are compatible with the case of MS patients who are known to have increased CSF levels of TNF-&#945;, IFN-&#947;, and IL-1&#946;, among other inflammatory mediators (Rovaris et al., 1996; Khademi et al., 2000; Baraczka et al., 2003).These findings altogether may explain the inflammation-induced synaptic alterations and the subsequent neurodegenerative processes in MS, and might in turn account for the appearance of MS fatigue.Knowing the interaction between tDCS and long-term changes in neurotransmission, tDCS effects might occur through the modulation of inflammation-induced synaptopathy in MS patients. For instance, two pharmacological studies have found that tDCS-induced after-effects take place via the modulation of NDMA glutamatergic receptor activity, which are known to be highly implicated in neuroplasticity (Liebetanz et al., 2002; Nitsche et al., 2003). Furthermore, anodal and cathodal tDCS were found to respectively decrease GABA and glutamate levels (Stagg et al., 2009). Interestingly, anodal tDCS was found to significantly increase the combined glutamate and glutamine levels beneath the stimulating electrode (Clark et al., 2011; Hunter et al., 2015). Finally, in one study combining MRS and fMRI assessment, anodal tDCS over the motor cortex was found to increase motor learning by increasing the resting motor network FC, probably through a decrease in motor cortex GABA levels (Stagg et al., 2014).Along with the GABA and glutamate changes encountered in MS, a recent work has introduced the dopamine hypothesis in MS fatigue (Dobryakova et al., 2015). Dopamine neurotransmission is also likely involved in NIBS-induced cortical neuroplasticity (Fresnoza et al., 2004, 2014; Nitsche et al., 2006, 2009, 2010; Kuo et al., 2008; Monte-Silva et al., 2009, 2010, 2011; Tanaka et al., 2013).Thus, tDCS could promote various beneficial synaptic changes which might be helpful in counteracting the deleterious impact of MS on neurotransmission and possibly alleviating fatigue.\nNIBS studies in MS fatigue\nTo the best of our knowledge, the effects of NIBS on MS fatigue have been evaluated in four studies so far, three of which were based on tDCS use in a double-blind, sham-controlled, crossover design (Ferrucci et al., 2014; Saiote et al., 2014; Tecchio et al., 2014) (Table 6). These studies consisted of two blocks of five consecutive daily sessions of either real or sham tDCS.In the first study, Ferruci et al. applied daily sessions of sham or active anodal tDCS over M1 bilaterally, blocks were held apart by at least 1 month (Ferrucci et al., 2014). Two-third of the patients were found to have a significant improvement in their fatigue scores, up to the third week following active tDCS. Sham condition did not result in any significant effects. Interestingly, &#8220;responder&#8221; patients were found to be younger than their &#8220;non-responder&#8221; counterparts; no other significant difference was found between both groups in terms of disease duration and severity. Such a difference is quite interesting and could partly explain the results since older patients might be less susceptible to the neuroplasticity processes which could render them less responsive to tDCS (Boggio et al., 2010).A second study assessed the effects of anodal tDCS over the left DLPFC (Saiote et al., 2014). Fatigue scores improved in about half of the patients following both active and sham tDCS, without any significant difference between the two conditions. The lack of difference between both stimulation conditions could have been resulted from a carry-over effect since stimulation blocks were separated by only 2 weeks which might be too short to exclude interference.In the third study, following navigation-guided anodal tDCS over the bilateral somatosensory cortices, all patients significantly improved after real but not sham stimulations (Tecchio et al., 2014). Clinical improvement ranged from 2 to 76% and lasted for 8 weeks. Such results can be accounted by some facts. First, concerning stimulation target, the bilateral somatosensory areas are quite and involve the representation areas of the face, upper limbs and lower limbs bilaterally; which might explain its greater efficacy compared to the stimulation of the bilateral hand motor areas or the left DLPFC selected in the abovementioned studies. Second, regarding the study design, the authors stated that the stimulation blocks were not performed in summertime to avoid the induction of fatigue by hot temperatures. In addition, unlike the washout intervals adapted in the other two studies (2 weeks vs. 4 weeks, respectively), a strict washout interval was defined by the authors. In other terms, a patient who completed the first stimulation block was not allowed to have the second one until the MFIS score at the follow-up evaluation satisfies the following condition: MFIS&#8201;at&#8201;evaluation&#8201;&#8722;MFIS&#8201;preblock1MFIS&#8201;preblock1<0.5&#215;MFIS&#8201;postblock1&#8722;MFIS&#8201;preblock1MFIS&#8201;preblock1. This might have minimized any possible carry-over effects that usually add difficulties to the results interpretation. Furthermore, the combination of neuronavigation technique with tDCS could have optimized the outcomes, keeping in mind the superior role of neuronavigation compared to the classical non-navigated interventions (Lefaucheur, 2010).Apart from tDCS, one iTBS protocol was performed to determine its effects on spasticity, fatigue, and quality of life in 30 RRMS patients: iTBS was applied with or without exercise therapy in a sham-controlled manner (Mori et al., 2011). The stimulation coil was positioned over the M1 leg region contralaterally to the most affected limb, for 10 sessions (protocol duration: 2 weeks; 10 bursts; 600 pulses). iTBS combined with exercise therapy was significantly able to reduce spasticity and fatigue, ameliorating the quality of life. However, iTBS alone could only decrease spasticity, without having any effect on fatigue. Although interesting, such preliminary results need to be replicated and further assessed in future works.\nConclusion\nThese data altogether suggest that during the course of the disease, the inflammation along with the demyelination, synaptopathy and neurodegeneration might lead to several structural and functional abnormalities in cortico-subcortical circuits. The latter can take parts in the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical loop of MS fatigue. Considering MS as a spectrum where the extreme destructive sequels of an MS-attack lie on one pole, and the potential healing and neuroplasticity processes on the other; the clinical manifestations do not seem to exclusively depend on the structural damage, but rather on the balance between restorative and inflammatory/degenerative processes. This vision can be applied to the fatigue loop, the breakdown of which might result in the co-occurrence of the physical, mental, and psychosocial domains of fatigue. Facing the pharmacological limitations in treating MS fatigue, NIBS would pave the way for better therapeutics, especially that tDCS has a promising role in modulating the fatigue loop. In this perspective, optimizing the future protocols would be by acting on several factors. For instance, knowing that tDCS effects on MS fatigue can last for several weeks, extending the washout intervals might clarify the effects of each stimulation blocks by prohibiting the possibility of interference. Furthermore, in the light of discrepancy between the frequently administered fatigue scores and the change in the perceived fatigue on one side, and the complexity of this symptom on the other side, future studies might benefit from adapting better assessment tools, such as the visual analog scale for fatigue. Lastly, combining tDCS protocols with functional imaging would allow for a better understanding of the fatigue loop, which would further help in designing and tuning the ultimate therapeutic plans in MS fatigue.\nConflict of interest statement\nMAC, SSA, NR, RA and JPL declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.

TDH has been reported in about 10% of diaphragmatic injuries, but due to its silent nature, the diagnosis is frequently missed (1-3). The early diagnosis of a traumatic diaphragmatic injury is usually difficult. The rate of undiagnosed TDH was reported as 12-60%. It remains asymptomatic in almost 50% of the cases. Therefore, delayed presentation, days or even years after the primary traumatic event could be possible. Actually, most of them have been presented with a secondary complication such as anemia, bleeding, reflux, dyspnea, and ulcer or erosion formation (4, 5). Here we report a case of delayed TDH presenting with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) as an excuse to discuss this issue.\nCASE PRESENTATION\nThe patient was a 35-year-old man admitted to the emergency department (ED) with chief complaint of abdominal pain after having an outdoor dinner 3 days before. The pain had suddenly manifested in the epigastric area with a steady nature and propagation to the back. The pain got worse with motion and coughing. Concomitant symptoms were nausea and bilious vomiting. He had no defecation apart from gas passing since 2 days before with no evidence of melena or hematemesis. The patient had been admitted to another hospital 2 days before and was candidate for performing endoscopy, but he left that hospital against medical advice. He had a history of stab wound 4 months ago. He did not use drugs or alcohol.His was ill and tachypneic on admission and the vital signs were as follow: blood pressure (BP)=110/70 mmHg, pulse rate (PR)=137/min, respiratory rate (RR)=26/min, O2saturation (O2sat) = 98% (room air), oral temperature (OT)=36.5&#730;&#7428;. On physical examination, the epigastric area was tender in palpation and revealed voluntary guarding, but no distention. There was a scar of the previous injury on his chest wall, left hemithorax, posterior axillary line, between 8th and 9th ribs. No other abnormal findings were found.He was hydrated with 1-liter of 9% normal saline (NS). A nasogastric tube (NGT) was inserted and fixed that resulted in drainage of about 500cc dark blood. He was sent to cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) room and following cardiac monitoring and continuous pulse oximetry, foley catheter and central venous line (CV-line) were inserted. Blood and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) were prepared and pantoprazole infusion was started. He was candidate for emergent endoscopy for upper GIB. About 3 hours after admission, he had received 3liters of NS 0/9% and had about 2 liters of blood output via NGT. Thereafter BP=120/80 mmHg, his PR rose to 150/min. During resuscitation measures, he suddenly developed respiratory distress and O2sat dropped to 76% in spite of O2 administration with mask reservoir. The patient&#8217;s respiratory distress could not be justified by upper GIB alone, therefore bedside ultrasonography was done by an emergency medicine professor and some soft tissue without peristaltic motions was seen and lung tissue did not seem normal in the left side. He got intubated and immediately a portable chest x-ray (CXR) was done, the result of which showed a white-lung on the left side (figure 1). Pleural tap was performed, which was grossly bloody. After improvising chest tube, about 700cc bloody fluid was drained. His O2sat raised and reached 89%. He was sent to thoracic and abdominal spiral computed tomography (CT) scan with contrast, which showed the stomach in the left hemithorax (figure 2). With diagnosis of stomach strangulation and diaphragmatic herniation of gastro thorax, the patient underwent emergent surgery and the diaphragmatic defect was restored and total gastrectomy plusesophagojejunostomy and jejunostomy were done. Pathology reported gastric tissue&#8217;s full thickness necrosis. Figure 3 shows the patient&#8217;s CXR the day after surgery. The patient was discharged after 2 days with follow up recommendation.\nDISCUSSION\nThoraco-abdominal penetrating wounds are known as common causes of diaphragmatic injuries. These injuries are of smaller size compare with those induced from blunt trauma, however they may develop into larger injuries if left untreated. Such lesions could lead to a diaphragmatic hernia with a potential risk of complications such as strangulation that could lead to higher mortality (6). The significant part of complications happens 1-4 years after the primary damage. The progression of the diaphragmatic lesion would be expected into three phases: a) Acute phase that mediastinum compression cause respiratory difficulty; b) Latent phase that presented with non-specific respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms; c) Late phase that abdominal viscera herniation happened and may accompanied with obstruction or incarceration (7). It is likely that increasing the abdominal pressure, respiratory movements and intrapleural negative pressure could precipitate the herniation process. These events may result in incarceration, strangulation, gangrene and perforation. Mortality rate is very high when undergoing emergency repair for treating this condition and is estimated to be about 32%. Having these important nots in mind lead to proper physician clinical judgment considering diaphragmatic lesion after a thoraco-abdominal penetrating injury (8, 9). The plain CXR is diagnostic in about 73% of patients, and is commonly considered as the initial diagnostic imaging test. Intrathoracic visceral herniation, hemi-diaphragm elevation, diaphragmatic margin distortion and contralateral mediastinal shift are among the signs of diaphragmatic hernia on CXR (10).Ultrasonography can also be diagnostic in this regard. It allows detecting the absence of diaphragmatic movements, herniation of viscera or flaps of ruptured diaphragm (11).&#160;CT scan is also an accurate test to detect diaphragmatic injuries in such patients. Helical CT shows enhanced specificity and sensitivity for diagnosis of TDH, almost reaching 100%, and could be considered as a proper option in hemodynamically stable patients (12). In spite of all mentioned, laparoscopy is the gold standard modality for diaphragmatic examinations in patients with penetrating chest trauma (13). Thoracentesis for diagnosis should be avoided due to the risk of any fistula being present between the alimentary tract and the pleural space. The surgical repair is the treatment of choice and regularly, laparotomy is considered when associated intra-abdominal complications are suspected (14, 15). General surgeons carry out laparotomy in about 92% of the patients and thoracic surgeons perform thoracotomy in almost 78% of them. Mortality rate of early presented TDH is about 3%, and it is 25% in those with delayed presentations. The presence of gangrenous or perforated abdominal visceral in the chest cavity is commonly accompanied with higher mortality rate (16).To the best of our knowledge, although there are some cases of congenital TDH presented with GIB, this is one of the rare cases of delayed presentation of missed diaphragmatic violation via perforating chest trauma that resulted in TDH and presented with GIB and respiratory distress.\nCONCLUSIONS\nSmall diaphragmatic lesions, which usually result from stab wounds, may develop into larger injuries if left untreated and they might lead to a diaphragmatic hernia with a potential risk of early or late complications and mortality. One of the rare complications is GIB, which should be considered in a patient with past history of trauma and presentation of GIB.", "pmid": "31172099", "title": "Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding as Delayed Presentation of Traumatic Diaphragmatic Hernia; a Case Report", "journal_title": "Advanced Journal of Emergency Medicine", "authors": "Ali Arhami-Dolatabadi;Mohammadmehdi Forouzanfar;Sahar Mirbaha", "doi": "10.22114/AJEM.v0i0.44", "score": "0.0"}]
